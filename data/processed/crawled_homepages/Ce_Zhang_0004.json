My research centers around applying Multi-Modal and Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models for many real-world problems, including Misinformation Detection, Information Retrieval, and AI for Science. Earlier,  I served as the Technical Chair of DSAA-25 conference. I was awarded the Singapore Data Science Consortium PhD Dissertation Research Fellowship 2021 for research excellence (only 6 PhD recipients across all Singapore universities in 2021). I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at The Pennsylvania State University and Yale University. I received PhD degree at Singapore Management University.[Call for Participation] I am looking for highly motivated PhD students with scholarship, visiting students, and interns (see details here). Welcome to send me your CV if you are interested in doing research together.Research InterestsMy research broadly lies in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Specifically, I focus on applying Multi-Modal and Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models for the following real-world problems.Misinformation Detection: Fact-Checking; Claim and Argument Detection; AI-Generated Content Detection; Hallucination Detection.Information Retrieval: Information Retrieval and Search; Recommender Systems.AI for Science and Healthcare: AI for Medical Texts, Medical Images, Protein, Molecule, and Peer-Reviewed Research.Google SitesReport abusePage detailsPage updated Google SitesReport abuse",
