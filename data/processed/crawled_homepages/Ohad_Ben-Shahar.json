In October 2004 I joined Ben Gurion University, where I am a professor of Compuer Science, head of the School of Brain Sciences and Cognition, former chairperson (2017-2020) of the Department of Computer Science, and the founding director of the Interdisciplinary Computational Vision Laboratory. Although focusing on computational vision, my interests span all aspects of theoretical, experimental, and applied vision sciences, and their relationship to cognitive science as a whole. In particular, I am interested in: Theoretical Computational Vision Human Perception and Visual Psychophysics Visual Computational Neuroscience Animal Vision Biologically Inspired Robot Vision Applied Computer Vision for Robotics I am always looking for excellent graduate students to join my group. If any of the vision sciences catches your imagination and research is your passion, I will be happy to chat with you about the opportunities in the lab. Outstanding undergraduate students looking for a senior project or research internships are welcome also. E-mail: ben-shahar@cs.bgu.ac.il Phone: + 972 8 647 7868 Direct Fax: + 972 8 647 7975 Dep.
