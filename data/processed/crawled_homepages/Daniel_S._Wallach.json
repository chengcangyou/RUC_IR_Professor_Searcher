Otherwise, I'm still a professor in Rice University's Department of Computer Science (also the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering), specializing in computer security. My research interests include mobile code, wireless and smartphone security, and the security of electronic voting systems. I'm also a Rice Scholar at the Baker Institute for Public Policy. Teaching I'm not teaching while I'm at DARPA, but you might be interested in previous courses I've taught. Publications All my papers are available online. You can see some of my talks. You may be interested in our tamper evident data structures, the Rice Wireless Localization Toolkit, VoteBox, or our Android extensions. My manuscript on rebooting the CS publication process has also been very popular. Voting Security Testimony before the Texas Senate Special Committee on Election Security, February 2018. Post-hearing letter. Testimony before the U.S. Congress Space, Science, & Technology Committee on Voting Security, September 2016. Post-testimony Q&A, October 2016.
