Publications [ publications on DBLP | publications on Google scholar | publications on SCOPUS | publications on ORCHID | publications in TU Dresden Research Information Portal (FIS-Pure) ] Books Research Areas Since software engineering is a discipline between theory and practice, we try to balance basic research with technology research and application-driven research. Model-Driven Robot Software Engineering (MORSE) MORSE is the queen discipline of systems engineering, because constructing, modeling, and programming of robots is hard. Since 2006, the chair is involved in MORSE; first with MDSD for Lego Mindstorms robots in the SuReal project, then for NAO robots in the Qualitune project, then for TurtleBots in the VICCI project, then for KUKA LBR in the T-RoX project, and even more robots:. SNIFFBOT (sniffing dangerous gases by immersive robotics) (2019-2021) with immersion into dangerous environments \"Software for Self-Adaptive Systems and Cobotics\" (SESAC). The cours presents results from CeTI on cobotics, SNIFFbot (immersive robotics) and many other interesting research-oriented topics.

The speciality of the Dresden group, Invasive Software Composition (ISC), is a technology for template and snippet composition (fragment composition). Plainly speaking, it is an advanced form of template metaprogramming (TMP), but it can do much more for you. Our group has worked on the following type-safe techniques for snippet composition and for constrution of program and model weavers: With Universal grammar-based ISC for textual languages, you can produce for a given grammar a snippet composition system. With this, you can enhance any language with template programming features like in BETA or C++ and build powerful snippet metaprogramming environments. Applications are [ Safe Template Languages ] and \"Component Models for Semantic Web Languages\". These works describe a general framework of grammar-universal ISC, i.e., how to take a grammar and generate from it a component model and snippet composition system for its language. Universal metamodel-based ISC for textual and graphical languages is the extended approach working with EMF metamodels [ Extending Grammars and Metamodels for Reuse - the Reuseware approach ] [ JOT Paper on Reuseware ] Orchestration style sheets (OSS) is our newest approach for styling the parallelization and distribution of sequential programs (progressive parallelization). Style sheets are a very general form of rewriting-based aspects, controlled by attribute grammars. [First Paper on OSS | Overview of Orchestration Path of cfAED | Semantics-aware composition for parallelization ] Attribute-driven ISC: With attribute-driven ISC, weavers can be built for Aspect-Orientation Development (AOSD) and Aspect-Oriented Modeling (AOM). Remote Attribute Grammars describe data- and control-flow between remote parts of the syntax tree of the program. The theory was worked out by Dr. Sven Karol in his PhD thesis \"Well-Formed and Scalable Invasive Software Composition\" [pdf]. The corresponding demonstrator tool is the SkAT composition tool. Reference-attribute grammar driven rewriting (RACR): if analysis phase of a reference attribute grammar are interchanged with rewriting, a novel method for context-sensitive term rewriting results. The RACR toolset is managed by Christoff BÃ¼rger, now in Lund, Sweden. Agile Business Modeling in Smart Ecosystems (Lean Startup for Software and Innovation Ecosystems) Innovation Ecosystems: Coopetition, cluster and innovation research. Our Lean Innovation Center (LINC) made in the ECSEL-Project IoSense support distributed innovation management.Grab yourself a password from the homepage and start to collect ideas for your projects. Feature Modeling of Open Software Families. Christoph Seidl, now in IT University Copenhagen, did his PhD here. Course Software as a Business (SaaB) discusses how to create software innovations with working business models, also for product lines, product matrices, and software ecosystems. Lean startup only scales with Software Product Lines, Matrices and Ecosystems. Here is the material for the \"Dungeon of Dragons\" pitch day of Jan 28, 2019. \"Dungeon of Dragons\" (HÃ¶hle der LÃ¶wen) with 5 pitches for new company ideas on Wed, Jan 31, 16:30 in HÃ¶rsaal E023, Andreas-Pfitzmann-Bau. Course http://st.inf.tu-dresden.de/teaching/swm (Software Project Management) Agile Teaching Agile teaching employs the methods of agine software engineering to teaching. Our group maintains the following feedback systems for students: INLOOP Java web platform for self-teaching of Java LINC Teaching platform Self-Adaptive Systems and Their Architectures Context- and Role-Based Modeling (Context-based Views) During the last years, we have have learned that Model-Driven Software Engineering should be based on languages with contexts and roles (Context- and Role-based Modeling and Metamodeling). Roles capture context-sensitive object behavior in specific contexts. Role systems automatically adapt to context changes. Contexts and roles can be applied to objects, models, and metamodels (for language engineering). This is an exciting new area of MDSD! Fog architectures with the IoSense software framework The big book on SAS Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDSD) in Technical Spaces MDSD is cool because it shows complex software in simple views (models). Megamodels and Model-driven software development (MDSD) Model synchronization, macromodels, and round-trip engineering This technology keeps a set of software views (models and codes) consistent, so that they are called a macromodel. Ontology-Driven Software Development (ODSD): ODSD couples ontologies to software models, to be able to use advanced reasoning technologies in requirements engineering or design. Dr. Katja Siegemund has worked on the employment of ontologies in requirements specification [pdf]. The MOST project produced a Springer book on ODSD. Course Model-Driven Software Development in Technical Spaces (MOST) summarizing the most modern literature in the research area. It discusses macromodels, megamodels, technical spaces and other ways to develop REAL software. Software Product Lines Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) maintains a configuration model in the problem space together with a system in the solution space (component space).
