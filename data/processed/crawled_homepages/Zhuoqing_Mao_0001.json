CS598-4: Advanced Topics in Computer Networks [W04] Research My research interests encompass network systems, mobile and distributed systems, and network/systems security. My work involves both empirical data collection and analysis, as well as the design and implementation of new systems. Here are some of my ongoing projects: Securing connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), e.g., tackling adversarial machine learning (AML) threats: (CV attack, LiDAR AML, AVGuardian). SmartHome Security, Android Unix Domain Socket and Security, Mobile Open Port Security, Kratos, PacketGuardian, UI state attack. Mobile computing, networking issues in data cellular networks, applications on smartphones. Mobile cloud computing, data center networking. Network management for enterprise and ISP networks. Android security, side channels, malware characterization and deterrence.
