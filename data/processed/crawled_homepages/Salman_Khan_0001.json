Abu Dhabi, UAE Email Twitter LinkedIn Google Scholar I am an Associate Professor at the Computer Vision Department, MBZUAI. Previously, I was a Senior Scientist at Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence and a Research Scientist in the Computer Vision Research Group (CVRG) at Data61, CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization). I am also an adjunct faculty member at College of Electrical & Computer Science (CECS), Australian National University (ANU) since 2016. I was a research visitor at NICTA (National ICT Australia) in 2015 and also served as a research affiliate with Australian Center for Robotic Vision (ACRV). I work on model generalization, multi-modal learning, learning from limited data (zero and few-shot learning), and continual life-long learning systems for computer vision problems. The above-mentioned tasks can help us realize intelligent autonomous systems that can better understand the real world for improved recognition, detection, segmentation, and detailed scene comprehension. I am also interested in the applications of vision and learning algorithms to earth observation and climate science. Positions Available! I am looking for exceptional candidates for two tracks: a) PostDocs, b) Research engineers at MBZUAI. PostDoc candidates are preferred to have a background in AI4Climate, Remote Sensing or Multimodal models. Research engineers must demonstrate strong development skills via past projects (background in GIS and remote sensing, AI4Climate is a plus). Candidates are expected to have good grades in their BS/MS programs and relevant background in AI/computer vision/machine learning (demonstrated through relevant coursework and past projects). Prior publication record in CVPR/ECCV/ICCV/NeurIPS/ICLR/ICML is a plus. If you are interested, please email me your CV and a link to your GitHub profile. 🔥 News Honored to receive the Provost's Distinguished Research Award at MBZUAI. Grateful to my family, collaborators, students and colleagues! Our AirCast model won the best paper award at TerraBytes workshop at ICML, 2025!
