Thesis title: \"Computing the Discrepancy.\" Advisor: David P. Dobkin. M.A., October 1992, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J. Computer Engineering and Informatics Diploma, 1990, University of Patras, Greece. Academic Experience Dimitrios Gunopulos is currently a Professor in the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Athens. He got his PhD from Princeton University in 1995. He has held positions as a Postoctoral Fellow at the Max-Planck-Institut for Informatics, Visiting Researcher at the University of Helsinki, Research Associate at the IBM Almaden Research Center, and joined the Department of Computer Science and Engineering in the University of California Riverside as an Assistant Professor in 1999 where he became an Associate Professor (with tenure) and a Full Professor. His research is in the areas of Data Mining, Knowledge Discovery in Databases, Databases, Sensor Networks, Peer-to-Peer systems, and Algorithms. He has developed clustering, classification and indexing techniques for high-dimensional and object trajectory data, data analysis tools for sensor networks, and is currently working on blog and document analysis problems. He has co-authored over a hundred journal and conference papers that have been widely cited and a book. He has supervised 8 Ph.D. Theses and 18 MS theses. His past students currently hold academic positions or are employed in top industry labs. His research has been supported by NSF (including an NSF CAREER award), by the DoD, by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (he participated in the design of the Infomine Project - www.infomine.ucr.edu), by the Tobacco Related Disease Research Program, by the European Commission (he participated in the projects MODAP - www.modap.org -, SemsorGrid4Env - www.semsorgrid4env.eu -, Health-e-Child - www.health-e-child.org -, and DBGlobe - www.softsys.uoi.gr/dbglobe/), by AT&T, and by Nokia. He has served as a General co-Chair in the IEEE ICDM 2010 conference, as a PC co-Chair in the ECML/PKDD 2011, IEEE ICDM 2008, ACM SIGKDD 2006, SSDBM 2003, and DMKD 2000 conferences, and as an Associate Editor at the Springer KAIS, IEEE TKDE, IEEE TPDS, and ACM TKDD journals.
