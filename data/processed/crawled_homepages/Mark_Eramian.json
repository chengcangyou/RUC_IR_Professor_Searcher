My research interests are contained within the broad areas of image processing and analysis, image segmentation, and computer-assisted diagnosis. I teach classes in image processing, computer vision, and data structures and algoirthms, and introductory programming. In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my daughters, computer gaming, board gaming, and playing clarinet and tenor saxophone. Prospective Students I am committed to running a lab that promotes and supports equity, diversity and inclusivity. For more information see the Lab Code of Conduct. I am often, but not always, looking for new graduate students. Due to extremely high rates of inquiry, I am unable to respond to most emails about available graduate student positions. A lack of response does not mean I did not read your email. Applicants cannot be fully considered until they apply to our graduate program. If you do so, indicate \"Computer Vision and Image Processing\" as your first choice of research area and I will see your application.
