Tools As a byproduct of my research, I have developed and contributed to a number of tools. Raven A deductive verifier for concurrent programs based on concurrent separation logic. GRASShopper A verification tool that checks functional correctness of programs manipulating heap-allocated data structures. Vermeer An automated debugging tool that traces and explains faults in C programs. Picasso A static analyzer for depth-bounded concurrent systems. It has been used to verify properties of non-blocking concurrent data structures and distributed message passing algorithms with an unbounded number of threads and messages.
