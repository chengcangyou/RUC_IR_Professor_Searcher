The institute comprises the groups of Prof. Dr.-Ing. Annika Eichler, Prof. Dr.-Ing. Timm Faulwasser and Prof. Dr. Herbert Werner. In lectures and labs, we provide the fundamental control education for all concerned bachelor and master programmes at TUHH. Jointly with our students, we explore the frontiers of systems and control research in advanced courses and seminars. We enable our students to solve application-relevant problems through mathematical abstraction. Our method-oriented research is focused on:Optimization-based and predictive controlData-driven and learning-based controlData-driven fault detectionDistributed control algorithms for cyber-physical systemsSystems theory for learning of dynamics We consider various application domains, e.g.,Multi-agent systems and mechatronicsMulti-energy systems and energy gridsParticle accelerators, medical engineeringClimate economics, process control, … TU Hamburg Institute of Control Systems Harburger Schloßstraße 22a 21079 Hamburg E-mail : control@tuhh.de Phone : +49 40 42878-3215 Fax : +49 40 42878-4016 Social Media Links How to find us Data Privacy Imprint Sitemap",
