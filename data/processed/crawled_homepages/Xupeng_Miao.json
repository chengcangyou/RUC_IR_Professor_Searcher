Before that, he was a Post Doctoral Fellow working with Prof. Zhihao Jia and Prof. Tianqi Chen in Catalyst Group and Parallel Data Lab at Computer Science Department of Carnegie Mellon University. He received his Ph.D. degree in computer science from Peking University in June 2022, supervised by Prof. Bin Cui, and his Bachelor’s degree from Northeastern University. He is the creator of Hetu, a highly efficient distributed deep learning system, and continuously leading the team development. He is broadly interested in machine learning systems, data management and distributed computing. Prospective students: I am actively looking for strong and self-motivated PhD/MS students, postdocs, and (remote) interns interested in building systems for machine learning to join my group. If you are interested in working with me, please read the FAQ info and send me an email with your CV and transcripts. News Jul 14, 2025 FlexLLM was accepted by NSDI 2026.
