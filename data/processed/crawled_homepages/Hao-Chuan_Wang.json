My broad research area is Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), with a focus on supporting collaboration and social interaction, including video-mediated communication, human-AI interactions, hybrid and remote work and wellbeing support. My intellectual type and research interest is both interdisciplinary (HCI, CSCW, Human-centered AI) and multidisciplinary (CS, Communication, Design, Learning Science). My research, teaching and service have been mainly evolving around the human-computer interactions of technology-mediated, collaborative and inclusive participation, specifically in the context of distributed knowledge work. My work looks into the design of collaborative systems for video communication, online education, human-human and human-AI teams and caregiving. I take human-centered, mixed-method approaches to study how such systems can be shaped to address personal and societal needs, such as bridging cultural, language and perception gaps in remote and hybrid work, and improving expert-novice knowledge transfer for productivity, as well as for fairness and equity.I was born in Taiwan, educated in Taiwan and the United States, and continuously contribute to public higher education and research of social goods as a university faculty first in Taiwan, and then in the United States. Before joining UC Davis in 2018, I was a faculty member of Computer Science and Information Systems at National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan (NTHU), Taiwan. I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Information Science, Cornell University (2008-2011). In addition to PhD training at Cornell, I also received postgraduate training at School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University (2006-2008), Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica (2004-2006), National Taiwan Normal University (2006), and National Chengchi University (2002-2004). Important Note to Students (Nov, 2025)There’s an ongoing phishing email scam across UC Davis campus, trying to get students to apply for interns and submit payments. I will never recruit interns through unsolicited emails, and won’t ask for any payments for interns. Also, all official communications from me will be sent through my ucdavis.edu email. If you receive one of the emails, please contact me directly for verification.some past rolesVisiting Scholar, Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taiwan, Jun - Jul 2024Visiting Associate Professor, Computer Science, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taiwan and National Chengchi University, Taiwan, Jun - Aug 2022Associate Professor (tenured), Computer Science, Information Systems and Applications, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan, 2017-2018; Assistant Professor, 2012-2017VP-at-Large, Executive Committee, ACM SIGCHI, Feb - Dec 2023 Editor, ACM CSCW 2025Steering Committee, ACM CSCW 2015-2018Papers Chair, ACM CSCW 2022 (Jul 2021 - Jan 2023); General Chair, ACM CSCW 2022 @ Taipei, Taiwan (Apr 2019 - Jul 2021)Subcommittee Chair (SC), Understanding People Subcommittee, ACM CHI 2017-2018Associate Chairs (AC), CHI 2024, CHI 2022, DIS 2022; CHIs, CSCWs, Group, ICMI, IJCAI, ECSCW, GI etc.Language Support and Inclusion Co-Chair, CHI’21, CHI'19, CHI'17 current rolesAssociate Professor, Department of Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering Graduate Program, University of California, Davis Graduate Advisor, GGCS, UC Davis, 2023-NowVP Finance (elected EC member), Executive Committee, ACM SIGCHI, 2024-2027Senior Program Committee, ACM CSCW 2026Workshop Chair, ACM CHI 2025-2026Associate Editor, Journal of Information Science and Engineering (published by Academia Sinica), 2022-Now HCW . CC 3.0 BY SA . 2013-2025",
