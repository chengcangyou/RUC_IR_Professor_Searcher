Braun - Universität Ulm Prof. Dr. Dr. Daniel Alexander Braun Daniel Alexander Braun studied physics (Dipl. 2005), biology (Dipl. 2005) and philosophy (Cand. phil. 2005), and received doctorates in natural science (Dr rer nat 2008) and philosophy (Dr phil 2011) at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität, Freiburg, in the subject areas of computational neuroscience and philosophy of mind respectively. He habilitated in neural and behavioral biology (2014) and cognitive science (2015) at the Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen. Previously, he was a visiting PhD student and postdoctoral research associate in the Computational and Biological Learning Laboratory (2006-2010) at Cambridge University and a visiting scientist (2010-2011) in the Computational Learning and Motor Control Laboratory at the University of Southern California. In 2011 he was awarded an Emmy-Noether-fellowship by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft to establish the independent research group “Sensorimotor Learning and Decision-making” at the Max-Planck-Institutes for Biological Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems in Tübingen. In 2015 he was awarded an ERC Starting Grant “BRISC: Bounded rationality in sensorimotor coordination”. Since 2016 he is Professor of Learning Systems at Ulm University.
