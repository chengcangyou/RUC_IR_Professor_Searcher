Since 1999 he has been University Professor of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at the University of A Coruña (UDC).He is currently Head of the Department of Computer Science & Information Technology at the UDC. In 1992 he founded the research group RNASA-IMEDIR (Artificial Neuron Networks and Adaptive Systems - Medical Informatics and Diagnostic Imaging and Radiology) at the UDC, which he currently directs, belonging to the INIBIC (Institute of Biomedical Research of A Coruña) and CITIC (Centre for Research in Information and Communication Technologies) of the UDC.In his research role, on 15/09/2021, he is the author of more than 150 articles in international journals of high impact JCR, with more than 5800 citations from other authors in Google Schoolar (index h 35 and index i10 104); and more than 100 publications including books, book chapters, international scientific conferences. In addition, he has been Director of more than 20 doctoral theses and principal investigator of more than 50 research projects financed in public and competitive regional, national and international calls; and of 30 collaboration contracts with companies and institutions. He is the author of 28 patents or utility registers, two of which are currently in use.He is also a member of multiple scientific committees of international scientific journals in the field of Computer Biomedicine and Artificial Intelligence and evaluator of 7 evaluation agencies for international research projects (NSF-NIH USA; German Research Initiative, Polish Research Agency; ISCIII;...). He is co-founder and expert in Artificial Intelligence and e-health of the company IKERDATA SL. He has been Vice-Rector for Research, Teaching Staff and Academic Organisation of the UDC and General Secretary of the Galician RTD Plan of the Xunta de Galicia. Finally, it should be noted that he has received important recognitions and awards for his professional work such as, among others, being elected \"Gallego del Año\", in 2015; distinguished with the Medal of Naval Merit with white badge, in 2016; Honorary Member of the School of Computer Engineering of Galicia, in 2016; and National Award of Informatics and Health by the Spanish Society of Health Informatics, in 2015.﻿ Subjects taught This section shows the teaching given in degrees, masters and other officers studies in last 6 years. 2025/2026 2024/2025 2023/2024 2022/2023 2021/2022 2020/2021
