My research focuses on algorithmic and mathematical problems at the intersection of probability theory, non-commutative analysis and mathematical physics. Before this, I was a post-doctoral scholar at UC Santa Cruz hosted by Prof. Alexandra Kolla. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Harvard University advised by Prof. Peter Love and Prof. Boaz Barak. During my Ph.D. I visited Prof. Luca Trevisan at Bocconi University. Prior to graduate school, I was a software engineer at Kensho, Inc. in the graph-infrastructure team. I hold a B.S. in physics, with minors in mathematics and computer science, from UIUC.",
