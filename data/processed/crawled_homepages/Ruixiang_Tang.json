I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Rice University, where I was advised by Dr. Xia Hu. I began my undergraduate studies in Biology at Tsinghua University, conducting research under the guidance of Dr. Xu Tan, and later transferred to the Department of Automation, completing my B.S. under the supervision of Dr. Jiwen Lu.Our research focus is in the realm of Trustworthy Machine Learning, a critical area that demands the infusion of trust throughout the machine learning lifecycle—from data acquisition and model development to deployment and user interaction. Within this overarching theme, I specialize in issues related to robustness and explainability. Additionally, I collaborate closely with biologists and health informaticians to apply machine learning in addressing critical challenges in biology and medicine.The Large Foundation Models (e.g., Large Language Models, Large Vision-Language Models, and Vision-Language Action Models) bring new and complex challenges to the trustworthiness of machine learning. Our long-term objective is to develop learning algorithms that enhance the reasoning capabilities of these models, making them more reliable, transparent, and resistant to misuse. By advancing the underlying reasoning mechanisms, we aim to strengthen their alignment with human intent and ensure their responsible use in real-world applications.🔥 I’m always looking for outstanding PhD students and research interns. If you’re interested, please email me with your CV, transcript, a summary of your research experience, and highlight publications. I will carefully review every application.Research Overview11/2025: Three papers accepted to AAAI 2026 (two orals, one poster).
