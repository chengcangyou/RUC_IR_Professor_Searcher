His lab develops cutting-edge open-source tools, methods, and resources to analyze, visualize, and interpret large-scale multi-omic and multi-ethnic data, applying these to decipher the role of the non-coding genome in advancing precision oncology and medicine. Email Share Before joining MBZUAI, Professor Khan was a senior research scientist at Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University where he led a bioinformatics team and developed scalable infrastructure for analyzing large-scale cancer multi-omic datasets. He contributed to major multi-institutional consortiums, including the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) and the Metastasis Research Network (MetNet). At Stanford University he also served as an Instructor for Stanford Biosciences to develop and teach a course on the art of reproducible science. His academic journey, spanning a PhD and postdoctoral work, deciphered the mechanisms underlying gene regulation, particularly by developing tools and resources for regulatory genomics. For over five years at Stanford Cancer Institute, he expanded his focus to cancer genomics by contributing to large-scale consortia to understand the mutational processes and complex rearrangements driving cancer initiation, progression, and evolution. Beyond his research, Professor Khan is a strong advocate for open science, reproducibility, and collaborative computational biology. He has developed widely used bioinformatics tools and resources such as JASPAR, Intervene, dbSUPER, and UniBind, which have become essential resources in regulatory genomics and transcription factor binding studies. He is also a Certified Instructor for The Carpentries, providing hands-on training in software and genomics data science. His commitment to open research is further demonstrated through his roles as an eLife and ASAPbio Community Ambassador, where he has actively promoted transparency and accessibility in scientific publishing. Professor Khan has been deeply engaged in teaching and mentorship, designing and leading courses on computational reproducibility, bioinformatics, and multi-omics analysis. He has organized numerous workshops and training programs globally, equipping early-career researchers with the skills needed to work with large-scale genomic datasets. He is passionate to contribute to advancing computational biology and translational genomics in the Global South.
