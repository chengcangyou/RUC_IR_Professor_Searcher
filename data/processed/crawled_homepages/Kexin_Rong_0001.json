My lab studies systems and algorithms to improve the computational and human efficiency of large-scale data analytics and is part of the Georgia Tech database group. I also spend time at VMware Research Group as an affiliated researcher. I am broadly interested in building systems and tools to help democratize data science, i.e., making it easy for non-experts to make sense and leverage the increasing large volumes of data by making the process more efficient and more accessible. Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in CS from Stanford (advised by Peter Bailis and Philip Levis) and my B.S. in CS from Caltech. I am actively looking for master and PhD students. If you are a GT student who is interested in working with me, please check out this page.
