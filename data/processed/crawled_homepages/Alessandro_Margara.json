I obtained my PhD Politecnico di Milano in 2012. I worked as a post-doctoral researcher in the High Performance Distributed Computing group, at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam between 2012 and 2014, and in the STAR research group at Università della Svizzera Italiana (USI, University of Lugano) between 2014 and 2016. I have been a visiting research scholar at the Purdue University in 2011. My research lab develops new solutions to ease the development of complex distributed software systems, targeting data-intensive applications in particular. My research intersects software engineering and distributed systems, proposing novel programming abstractions and implementing them into concrete systems.
