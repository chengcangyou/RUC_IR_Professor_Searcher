Two papers are about novel solutions to event data simulation and depth estimation. The other two papers are about video generation with panoramic representation and audio-sync capabilities.Jun 26, 2025ICCVÃ10 acceptedWe have ten papers accepted by ICCVâ25, including one oral and three highlight papers. They cover topics on new applications using neuromorphic cameras (as a vibrometry, for uncalibrated photometric stereo, diffusion-based HDR imaging using event/spike cameras), AI generated photography (to achieve neural lens blur and adaptive HDR), polarization based 3D reconstruction, and so on.Show More Welcome to Camera Intelligence LabOur lab conducts research on computational photography and computer vision at the Institute for Visual Technology / National Engineering Research Center of Visual Technology (IDM), School of Computer Science (CS), Peking University (PKU).We study and build Cameras powered with artificial Intelligence algorithms to benefit the next generation of AI through super-human visual sensing and computing.
