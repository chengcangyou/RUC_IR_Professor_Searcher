Prior to joining the Technion, I spent three years at VMware research as a postdoc, after completing my PhD in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University. My dissertation was awarded an Honorable Mention in CMU's School of Computer Science Dissertation Award and the 2022 PODC Doctoral Dissertation Award.My research focuses on building theoretical foundations for practical concurrent systems. I am most interested in understanding the factors that affect the performance of concurrent programs, and finding ways to rigorously analyze these costs. I also dabble in concurrent data structures and parallel/distributed algorithms.I was advised by Guy Blelloch. During my PhD, I was generously supported by the NSERC PGSD scholarship and the Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship. Prior to coming to CMU, I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto.My CV can be found here.Google SitesReport abusePage detailsPage updated Google SitesReport abuse",
