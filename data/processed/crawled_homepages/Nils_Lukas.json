This field of research includes a range of topics such as controlling the potential misuse of ML systems, enhancing the reliability of generated outputs, studying aligned and explainable ML systems and using confidential computing methods. Most recently, he has been active in developing provably robust watermarking methods to detect ML-generated content, auditing differentially private language models, and inferring confidential user data with ML systems without revealing it to the ML service provider. Email Share Prior to joining MBZUAI, Professor Lukas received his Ph.D. from the University of Waterloo in Canada, where he was generously supported by the David R. Cheriton Scholarship for outstanding academic achievements. His Ph.D. dissertation was awarded the Mathematics Doctoral Prize’s Top Honor, and in 2024 he was a finalist for the Governor’s General Gold medal in Canada. During his Ph.D., Lukas joined Microsoft Research and Borealis AI as a research intern to research privacy in large language models. He publishes to top-tier machine learning and security conferences, such as ICLR, USENIX and IEEE S&P, and his work has received a distinguished contribution award at Microsoft MLADS in 2023.
