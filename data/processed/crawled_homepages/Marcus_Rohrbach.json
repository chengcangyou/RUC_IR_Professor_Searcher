If you are interested in working with me, reach out! Previously, I was a FAIR Research Scientist at Meta AI (2017-2023). I was a PostDoc at UCB (University of California, Berkeley) at EECS and ICSI with Trevor Darrell (2014-2017), and I did my PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics with Bernt Schiele (2010-2014). My interests include computer vision, computational linguistics, and machine learning, as well as how to make models reliable so we can trust them. An up-to-date list of my publications can be found on Google Scholar. Copyright © 2025 Marcus Rohrbach. Me WordPress Theme by themehall.com",
