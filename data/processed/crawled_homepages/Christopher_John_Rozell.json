Rozell is a researcher and educator advancing our understanding of brain function in health and disease, as well as the design of therapeutic neurotechnologies. Dr. Rozell's research is highly interdisciplinary and collaborative, living at the intersection neuroscience, data science, neuroengineering and cognitive science. His close clinical collaborations focus on developing scalable brain stimulation therapies for psychiatric disorders such as treatment resistant depression. In addition to his technical contributions, Dr. Rozell's scholarly activity also includes research and creative work that advances our understanding of the societal impacts of neurotechnology and amplifies lived experiences voices. Dr. Rozell is currently the Executive Director of the Institute for Neuroscience, Neurotechnology & Society at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he is also the Julian T. Hightower Chaired Professor of Electrical & Computer Engineering. He serves on the advisory boards for Motif Neurotech, Inc., the Institute of Neuroethics, and the Community for Rigor. Dr. Rozell is a proud first-generation scholar who co-founded Neuromatch, Inc., a nonprofit building an accessible global community of collaborative computational researchers. He received a B.S.E. degree in Computer Engineering and a B.F.A. degree in Music in 2000 from the University of Michigan, received M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering in 2002 and 2007 from Rice University, and was a postdoctoral scholar at the Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience at the University of California, Berkeley. His research impact has been celebrated through recognitions that include the James S. McDonnell Foundation 21st Century Science Initiative Award (six international recipients), the National Science Foundation CAREER Award, election to Fellow of American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering, and a US Congressional briefing celebrating the 10th anniversary of the NIH BRAIN Initiative. Beyond the laboratory, Dr. Rozell's training impact has been recognized by several awards, including the Howard Ector Outstanding Teacher Award and The Neuro â Irv and Helga Cooper Foundation Open Science International Prize (Neuromatch). His mentees have been recognized with several international awards (e.g., Schmidt Science Fellowship, Fulbright Fellowship, Open Philanthropy Technology Policy Fellowship, NIH K99/R00) and now hold leadership roles in a variety of academic, industry, and public policy institutions. << return to people Georgia Institute of Technology School of Electrical and Computer Engineering",
