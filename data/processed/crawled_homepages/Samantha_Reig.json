Samantha (Sam) Reig — she/her — Sam_Reig@uml.edu Human-computer interaction (HCI) and human-robot interaction (HRI) researcher I am an Assistant Professor in the Miner School of Computer and Information Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. My research interests include artificial intelligence (AI) embodiment in socially complex interactions, robot re-embodiment, personalized experiences with AI agents in services, and designing for human-AI collaboration. I use behavioral studies and research-through-design, as well as qualitative and quantitative methods, to explore topics in these areas. I received my Ph.D. in human-computer interaction from the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by Jodi Forlizzi and Aaron Steinfeld. My graduate research was supported by a NASA fellowship. A full list of publications is available on my CV and on my Google Scholar page. Get in touch Email is the best way to reach me. If we are already in a Slack workspace together, feel free to reach out through a DM. You can also find me on LinkedIn and Twitter, but my response times there are slower than email. If you are at UMass Lowell: I leave my office door open as often as possible – stop on by! I am interested in all things people + technology + interpersonal outcomes, and welcome collaboration proposals that sit anywhere in, or intersect with, that space.",
