I am an assistant professor in Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Michigan, part of our MPLSE research community. My research utilizes mathematical techniques to help in design, analysis and implementation of programming languages. I am recently interested in interoperability between languages, especially in the guises of Gradual Typing and compiler intermediate languages supporting multiple source languages.
