Cheriton School of Computer Science University of Waterloo Waterloo, Ontario, Canada N2L 3G1 Office: DC 3526 Email: firstname.lastname@uwaterloo.ca Menu: Home Publications Students Teaching Professional Activities Software My research interests are in information privacy and computer and networks security. My current research focus is on user authentication, including authenticating users based on their behavioural or physiological biometrics. I also study the use of machine learning for securing or attacking devices and services. I have also worked on privacy-preserving technologies for location-based services and mobile applications, privacy-preserving location verification technologies, genomic privacy, and end-to-end voter-verifiable voting systems. I am a member of the Cryptography, Security, and Privacy (CrySP) research group, the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute (CPI), and the Systems and Networking Group. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon in August 2005. Prior to that, I received an M.S. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon and a Dipl. Informatik-Ing. ETH from ETH Zürich (Curriculum Vitae). Original design by Andreas Viklund",
