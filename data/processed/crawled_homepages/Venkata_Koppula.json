I am a faculty member in the Computer Science and Engineering department at IIT Delhi. Before this, I was a postdoc at the Weizmann Institute of Science, hosted by Zvika Brakerski. I obtained my Ph.D. from University of Texas, Austin, where my advisor was Brent Waters. My area of research is theoretical cryptography.
