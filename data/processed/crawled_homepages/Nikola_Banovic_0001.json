I specialize in the design and evaluation of AI explanation mechanisms that can help develop or improve AI literacy of end-users who lack computer science backgrounds. This could help such end-users critically reflect on strengths and limitations of AI-based systems, and help them decide when and how to use such computational technology. My work has been recognized with an NSF CAREER award, and best paper and honorable mention awards at premier HCI conferences. Before joining the Computer Science & Engineering department at the University of Michigan as a faculty, I received my Ph.D. degree from the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) at Carnegie Mellon University, and my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto. For more information, see my Curriculum Vitae (CV). Announcements Students, I will never email you to offer you research employment if you did not apply for or inquire about a research position with me or the department first. Any such emails are likely Job Offer Scam.
