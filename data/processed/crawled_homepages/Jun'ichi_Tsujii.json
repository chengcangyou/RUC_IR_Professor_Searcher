I was Associate Professor at Kyoto University from 1979 to 1988 with a break at CNRS Grenoble, France as invited senior researcher in 1981-1982. I was Professor of Computational Linguistics of University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST) in the UK from 1988 to 1995, where I kept the position of Research Professor until 2001. I was appoined as a professor in the Tokyo University Graduate School in 1995, and, prior to taking on my current position, I was a principal researcher for Microsoft Research Asia (Beijing) from 2011 onwards.
