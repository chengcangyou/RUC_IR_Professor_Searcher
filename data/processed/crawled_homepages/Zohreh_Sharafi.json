My research explores the problem-solving strategies developers use during software development and how human factorsâsuch as genderâshape these strategies. I am passionate about improving software engineering tools and practices to make them more inclusive and supportive of diverse developer populations. Previously, I was a Senior Research Fellow in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where I worked with Dr. Westley Weimer. I was proud to be awarded the prestigious NSERC Postdoctoral Fellowship. My earlier work investigated the impact of visualization techniques on program comprehension, requirements traceability, and model-driven development in software engineeringâas well as global image registration methods in computer vision. Before academia, I worked as a software engineer at Morgan Stanley, contributing to the firmâs flagship electronic trading platform for listed securities. I also served as the principal architect of SURF, a market data simulator designed to enhance debugging and performance testing processes. I earned my Ph.D. in Software Engineering from UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al under the supervision of Dr. Giuliano Antoniol and Dr. Yann-GaÃ«l GuÃ©hÃ©neuc. My dissertation focused on how different types of visualizations affect program comprehension and how gender can influence this process. You can read my thesis here. Born and raised in Tehran, I enjoy living in dynamic, multicultural cities. I've had the pleasure of calling New York, Ann Arbor, and now MontrÃ©al home.
