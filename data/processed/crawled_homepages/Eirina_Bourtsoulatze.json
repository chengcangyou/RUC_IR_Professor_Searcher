Profile Teaching and supervision Publications Grants and funding Contact Profile Teaching and supervision Publications Grants and funding Contact Profile Biography I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in machine learning for communications in the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering (CSEE), University of Essex, UK. I obtained my PhD degree from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (Ecole Polytechnique Fédéral de Laussane), Switzerland, in 2013, and my Diploma degree (MSc equivalent) in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, in 2008. Upon completion of my PhD, I have held senior research positions with the Communications and Distributed Systems group in the Institute of Computer Science, University of Bern, Switzerlan, and the Information Processing and Communications lab in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Imperial College London, UK. In 2018 I was awarded the highly competitive Marie Curie Individual Fellowship which was hosted by the Information and Communication Engineering group in the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering at University College London (UCL), UK. My current research focuses on applications of deep neural networks to joint source-channel coding and source rate-distortion optimization for visual data. My general research interests include machine learning, network coding and wireless edge caching for multimedia communications.
