To have bosom friends who share your learning from all over the world, doesn't it bring the greatest happiness ? To be unknown to people and yet remain undisturbed, isn't that an act of the most virtuous man ? --- The Analects , Chapter 1:1 \"I have a lot of respect for people, not because of their talent but for what they do with their talent and how they get the maximum from their talent. What do you do to get talent? You have the right genes, or the right parents. But what you do with that talent is down to you.  I have met many people who had lots of talent, but they never did anything.\" --- Arsene Wenger on \"talent\", Sep 2007 Anthony's other 5 cents in life For the researcher that is in every one of us: 1,2,3 Anthony K.
