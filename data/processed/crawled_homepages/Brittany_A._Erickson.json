Biography: Dr. Erickson received her PhD in mathematics from UC Santa Barbara in 2010. She was a National Science Foundation postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University in the Department of Geophysics and a computational seismology postdoc at San Diego State University, before becoming a professor of mathematics at Portland State University. She joined the University of Oregon in 2018 where she holds a joint appointment in Computer Science and Earth Sciences.  Erickson develops high-performance numerical methods (both traditional and machine-learning-based) for both forward and inverse modeling of earthquake and volcano processes that integrate real-world data. She is the recipient of several grants, including a recent NSF CAREER award which includes support of one of her passions: mentoring and training the next generation of STEM scientists. Erickson co-founded the global SEAS code verification efforts, co-leads the numerical DET working group for the Cascadia Regional Earthquake Science Center, and currently serves as vice-President of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) Pacific Northwest sectional. Erickson loves living in the Pacific Northwest, and sharing in its natural beauty with her husband and two young children. Made in RapidWeaver",
