Profile Research Teaching and supervision Publications Grants and funding Contact Profile Research Teaching and supervision Publications Grants and funding Contact Profile Biography Welcome to my Essex page. (More details of my research: https://sites.google.com/site/zilongliu2357.) I am always looking for highly motivated students, visitors, and collaborators. Please don't hesitate to drop me an email if you are interested in my research. If you have obtained (or close to) a PhD and wish to work with me as a postdoc researcher, there are a number of excellent Fellowships that we may explore together: Newton International Fellowships (2 years, THE ROYAL SOCIETY), University Research Fellowship (up to 8 years, THE ROYAL SOCIETY), Leverhume Trust Early Career Fellowship (3 years), EPSRC Postdoctoral Fellowships (3 years), MSCA Postdoc Fellowship (2~4 years), YUFE Postdoc Fellowship (3 years, under MSCA). My research lies in the interplay of coding, signal processing, and communications, with a major objective of bridging theory and practice as much as possible. One of my research aims is to understand the fundamental limits and bound-achieving design/processing approaches of various communication signals (e.g., codebooks, waveforms, sequences, and channel codes). I am extremely interested in attacking research problems that arise in practical communication and/or signal processing scenarios. In recent years, I have developed a strong interest in advanced 6G V2X communication, sensing, and localization technologies for future connected autonomous vehicles as well as machine learning for enhanced communications and networking. From January 2018 to November 2019, I was a Senior Research Fellow at the Institute for Communication Systems (ICS), Home of the 5G Innovation Centre (5GIC), University of Surrey, focusing on air-interface design of 5G networks and beyond (e.g., machine-type communications, URLLC, 5G NR, V2X, NOMA), working with Prof Pei Xiao and Prof Klaus Moessner (now with TU Chemnitz, Germany). During this period of time, I was a key researcher in the EPSRC project “New Air Interface Techniques for Future Massive Machine Communications\" (EP/P03456X/1) and the EU-Taiwan project “Converged Wireless Access for Reliable 5G MTC for factories of future - Clear5G\" (761745). Prior to my career in UK, I spent 9.5 years in the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, first as a Research Associate (Jul. 2008 to Oct. 2014) and then a Research Fellow (November 2014 to Dec. 2018). During my work in NTU, I participated in a number of advanced projects on design and prototyping of ultra-reliable communication systems (e.g., zero-correlation zone CDMA, CPM). I received my PhD from NTU in June 2014 with a thesis entitled ``Perfect- and Quasi- Complementary Sequences\" , advised by Prof Guan Yong Liang. My PhD thesis, focusing on the fundamental limits, algebraic constructions, and applications of complementary sequences in wireless communications, has settled a few long-standing open problems in the field. These include: 1) An open problem left by Vladimir Levenshtein (Russian coding theorist) in 1999 on the tightening of aperiodic correlation lower bounds of binary sequence sets; 2) A generalized Levenshtein bound for quasi-complementary sequence sets which is tighter than the corresponding Welch bound; 3) The design theory of the optimal odd-length binary almost-complementary sequence pairs; 4) A novel correlator-bank assisted receiver design for truly interference-free multicarrier CDMA using complementary codes. These findings have been published in IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY, IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING, etc. I was a Visiting PhD student to University of Melbourne (May 2012 to Feb. 2013, hosted by Prof Udaya Parampalli) and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Jun 2013 to Jul. 2013, hosted by Prof Wai Ho Mow). I received my MSc Degree from Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in Jul. 2007, with a thesis entitled \"The Multistage Decoding Technique for DRM Receiver\", advised by Prof Huazhong Yang (IEEE Fellow). Trained to become a Digital IC Design Engineer, I played with communication system simulation and ASIC implementation during the MSc period. In Jun. 2004, I received Bachelor Degree from School of Information and Electronic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. I am/was an Associate Editor of IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (April 2022 to July 2025), IEEE Wireless Communications Letters, IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society, IEEE Access (January 2017 to January 2025), Frontiers in Communications and Networks, Frontiers in Signal Processing, as well as Advances in Mathematics of Communications (under American Institute of Mathematical Sciences). In 2019, I was endorsed to be an Exceptional Talent by The Royal Academy of Engineering. In 2019/2020/2021/2022/2023/2024, I was one of the World's Top 2% Scientists, according to reports from Stanford University. I was the Hosting General Chair of the 12th Sequences and Their Applications (website: https://seta-2024.github.io/) and the 10th IEEE International Workshop on Signal Design and its Applications in Communications (website: iwsda2022.github.io), two international conferences held at Essex. In January 2023, I was a Consultant to the National Institute of Information and Communication Technology (NIST), a Japanese Government organisation, on 6G V2X technologies for autonomous driving. From December 2023 to January 2024, I was a Red-Bird Visiting Scholar in the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. At Essex, I coordinate and supervise a number of research activities in 5G/6G wireless system design as the 6G Lab Manager. I was recognised as the 2024 Outstanding Mid-Career Researcher (media report: https://60stories.essex.ac.uk/research-with-impact/index.html) in the Faculty of Science and Health in May 2024, as part of our celebration for the 60th anniversary of the University. In the UK, I am a member of the EPSRC Peer Review College and a Fellow of Higher Education Academy. Flexible, passionate, and determined, I am very open to engage with you to push forward the exciting forefront of the wireless research.
