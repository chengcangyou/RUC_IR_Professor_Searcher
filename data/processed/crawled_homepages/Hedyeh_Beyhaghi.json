My research focuses on algorithmic game theory and mechanism design, machine learning theory, and algorithms under uncertainty. I received my PhD in Computer Science from Cornell University. Before joining UMass, I held postdoctoral research fellow positions at the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC), Northwestern University, and Carnegie Mellon University.
