We utilize biosignals and neuroimaging such as electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram, and functional magnetic resonance imaging. In addition, we are continuously exchanging and conducting active collaborative research with leading hospitals in Korea such as Samsung Seoul Hospital, and leading overseas groups such as the University of Liege, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the University of Texas at Dallas.Machine LearningDeep learning, Transfer learningExplainable AIComputational ModelingFunctional/causal connectivityNetwork theoryBiomedical AIDisease diagnosis and prognosis predictionClinical decision support systemNeural EngineeringBrain-computer interfaceHuman state monitoring Google SitesReport abusePage detailsPage updated Google SitesReport abuse",
