I am a database guy and am leading the UIC DBGroup. My research interest spans several areas of database systems including data provenance, data integration, query execution and optimization, and data curation. I strive to build real systems that are based on solid theoretical foundations. For a list of my publications see below or have a look at DBLP and google scholar. Here is a current CV. Short Bio I received a Diploma (Master) in Computer Science from the RWTH Aachen in Germany, and a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Zurich in Switzerland being advised by Michael Böhlen and Gustavo Alonso. Afterwards, I spend to two years as a PostDoc in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto working at the Database Research Group under Renée J. Miller. Before joining UIC in 2024, I was a Professor of Computer Science at Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago from 2012 to 2023. Contact Information Department of Computer Science 851 S.
