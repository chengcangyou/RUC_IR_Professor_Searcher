I am in the Theory Group, and my research is in approximation algorithms for uncertain environments (e.g. online/dynamic/streaming models). I also like pretty much anything involving submodular functions. See my job talk slides to get a sense of what I do. Prior to joining Rutgers, I was a Fulbright Postdoctoral Fellow at Tel Aviv University, working with Niv Buchbinder. I received my PhD in Algorithms, Combinatorics and Optimization (ACO) from Carnegie Mellon University in 2022, where I was fortunate to be advised by Anupam Gupta. Before that, I worked at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence from 2015 to 2017, and before that, I received a B.Sc. in Computer Science/Applied Mathematics, and a B.Sc. in Mathematics from Brown University, class of 2015.
