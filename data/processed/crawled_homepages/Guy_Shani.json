Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the Information Systems Engineering department at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel. Previously, I was a researcher at Microsoft Research, in the Machine Learning and Applied Statistics team, under Chris Meek. I graduated in 2007 from Ben Gurion University, Israel, under the supervision of Prof. Ronen Brafman and Prof. Solomon E. Shimony. My dissertation has focused on learning and solving Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), including both efforts in Reinforcement Learning under partial observability, and solving POMDPs using Point-Based methods. My M.Sc. dissertation, also under the supervision of Prof. Brafman and the guidance of David Heckerman, concerned the application of a Markov Decision Process to a Recommender System.",
