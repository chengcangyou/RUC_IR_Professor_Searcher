Research My principal research topic is the automatic analysis of algorithms' complexity, especially the inplicit computationnal complexity theory. The idea is, given an algorithm, to try and find its complexity and, if possible, another algorithm computing hte same function more efficiently. Between September 2015 and August 2017, I'll be Associate Professor at the University of Copenhagen. Since September 2006, I a member of the LCR team from LIPN.
