Prior to that, she was an NSF Computing Innovation Fellow at University of Maryland, College Park, working with Prof. Hal Daumé III. Jieyu received her Ph.D. from Computer Science Department, UCLA, where she was advised by Prof. Kai-Wei Chang. Her research interest lies in fairness of ML/NLP models. Her paper got the EMNLP Best Long Paper Award (2017). She was one of the recipients of 2020 Microsoft PhD Fellowship and has been selected to participate in 2021 Rising Stars in EECS workshop. Her research has been covered by news media such as Wired, The Daily Mail and so on. She was invited by UN-WOMEN Beijing on a panel discussion about gender equality and social responsibility. Her CV is available here. 🐾 Research | 📜 Papers | 🍋‍🟩 Lab I am broadly interested in research about how to get machines to understand and respond to human languages (natural language processing & machine learning). A few questions that drive my recent research are: How can we get models to efficiently learn knowledge? We develop post-training methods, including efficient fine-tuning, reinforcement learning from feedback (RLHF/RFT), and scalable agentic architectures to help LLMs learn new knowledge with minimal computational cost How can we rigorously evaluate model capabilities and limitations? We design comprehensive evaluation frameworks—covering reasoning, safety, cultural intelligence, and agentic behaviors—to better understand when and why models fail, and how to guide them toward more reliable performance. How can we reduce potential risks from the model? Our work introduces techniques to evaluate and mitigate biases, hallucinations, privacy leakage, and other safety concerns in LLMs, ultimately leading to more reliable and robust models. How can we advance better models and humans collaborations? We study how LLMs interact with people from diverse social and cultural backgrounds, and examine how AI can meaningfully support interdisciplinary applications—such as education, healthcare, and beyond. 📢 Attention: [PhD 2026] I am looking for PhD students to join my research group. But I'm still waiting for the university's guidance about PhD recruitment. I cannot make any promise at this moment. But if it is allowed, I'd anticipate to get 1-2 PhDs. If you are interested in doing research with my group, please check this first. If you want to request a recommendation letter, please fill in this form at least 3 weeks in advance. 📰 Recent News [Nov 2025] I will be at IVADO workshop.
