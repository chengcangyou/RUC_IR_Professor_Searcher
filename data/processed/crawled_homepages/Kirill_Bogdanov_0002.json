The work focused on bringing the achievements of the X-machine testing method, for testing software against its specification in Statecharts.Before becoming a lecturer, Dr Bogdanov worked as a research associate from Oct '99 until Aug 2000 in the Department of Computer Science, The University of Sheffield, on the EPSRC-funded MOTIVE project, testing object-oriented systems using an X-machine method. Research interests In traditional software development, specification and testing do not play an important role. In particular, changes to software code do not normally get reflected in a specification. At the same time, specification-based testing methods are very important for maintaing software quality, for identification of missing or incorrectly-implemented behaviour.K.Bogdanov`s research aims to develop a method and a tool to take an incomplete state-based specification, hints for developers as to how it relates to code and both: extract an up-to-date specificationgenerate tests from it.A number of existing specification based testing methods rely on a program under test being built with testing in mind, and lose a lot in power if this is not true. In his work, observation of program behaviour under test is used to make up for the missing information about a system, making it more amenable to testing using these methods.More recent work focuses on passive inference of software models from logs, where it is not possible to attempt experiments on a system being reverse-engineered.The experimental framework is being maintained as a free Statechum project.
