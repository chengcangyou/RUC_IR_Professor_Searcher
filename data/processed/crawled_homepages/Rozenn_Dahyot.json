I am a senior member of IEEE, and a member of ACM, EURASIP and IPRCS. I currently lead the MU CS department research committee (2023- now), and I am the CS coordinator for the MSc in Robotics and Embedded AI. I currently teach CS636 Deep Learning, co-teach CS410 Computer Vision, and supervise student projects. I also co-coordinate CS PhD structured programme with CS865 Computer Science PHD (Year 1) and CS875 Computer Science PHD (Year 2). My OpenAlex page is available at Open positions in my team (when available) are posted online at: MU Graduate Research Academy website for PhD scholarships MU HR for research fellow/assistant/etc (staff) positions. Bio Before joining Maynooth University, I have been (Assistant then Associate) Professor in Statistics (2008-2021), Lecturer in Computer Science (2005-2008) in the School of Computer Science and Statistics in Trinity College Dublin (Ireland). Before that, I had positions as Research Fellow on European projects (FP5, FP6) with Trinity College Dublin and Cambridge University UK (2002-2005), and Research Assistant in Laboratoire des Ponts et Chaussées Strasbourg in France (1998-2001). I have served as secretary (2008-2014) and president (2014-2020) of the Irish Pattern Recognition and Classification Society (IPRCS) that organizes the yearly Irish Machine Vision and Image Processing Conference (ImVIP). I was the IPRCS representative on the International Association for Pattern Recognition (IAPR) (2014-2020). I led the effort for organising the European Signal Processing Conference EUSIPCO2021 in Dublin in 2021 (August 23-27th 2021). My research interests are in between the traditional fields of Electronic and electrical engineering (digital signal processing), Computer Science (computer vision & graphics), artificial intelligence (data mining, machine learning) and Mathematics (Statistics, Information theory, decision theory, functional analysis). Maynooth University information: Key term dates. Deep Learning (or Machine Learning with Neural Networks) is a very popular approach for designing data-driven artificial intelligence (AI). It is used in many of our applications for object detection, image enhancement, data synthesis etc. Latest publications: IEEE ICASSP (2021), ACM IoT (2020), BMVC (2019), EUSIPCO (2019) Github BMVC 2019: Harmonic networks Github ICASSP 2021: Tensor reordering Pattern analysis is an important part for image processing. Some of our works have focused on developping robust techniques (e.g. M-estimation, Hough Transform, L2) for pattern registration (e.g. ellipse fitting) and reconstruction (e.g. 3D reconstruction from multiple views using RGB and RGB-D cameras). Publications: Pattern Recognition (PR) (2018), PR (2016), PRL (2014), DSP (2013), PR (2013), PAMI (2009), Github PAMI 2009: SHT Colour transfer aims at changing the colour feel of an image (target image) using the colour palette of another image (palette image). Colour transfer can also be applied to videos, and for creating dynamic effects on static images. We have proposed several approaches to solve this problem based on Optimal Transport and information theory (L2 with GMM) as cost functions to minimize between colour distributions. Publications: MMSP (2020), EUSIPCO (2019), IMVIP (2019), CVIU (2019), CVIU (2007), ICCV (2005) Github 2019: L2 GMM Github 2007: Optimal Transport Object detection in road scene sequential images has many applications from mapping to autonomous driving. My PhD thesis (2001) investigated linear machine learning techniques (PCA) and histogram backprojections for object detection and recognition. Our more recent approaches use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Publications: IMVIP (2020), Remote Sensing (2018), ICIP 2018, CVPR 2000, ICIP 2001 Github: ICIP 2001 Using computer vision and deep learning to automate registration of assets for telecoms operators, utility companies and civil infrastructure providers, AIMapIT replaces manual site surveys with fast, accurate detection and geotagging of assets from street level imagery with 2m accuracy. aimapit.com Climate change is affecting people and their way of life including transportation of goods and people. Our work (2019) proposes to analyse satellite imagery in combination with street view imagery posted on social media during flooding events, for assessing the passability of roads. More recently (2020), we propose to infer 3d shape of roofs from aerial imagery (e.g. for measuring solar energy potentials). Latest publications: Remote Sensing (2020) Signal Processing: Image Communication (2019) Github: Remote sensing 2020 Blendshape facial rigs are used extensively in the industry for facial animation of virtual humans. This research project explores the noticeability of blendshapes and presents new perceptually based models to predict perceptual importance of blendshapes (collaboration led by Rachel McDonnell). Latest publications: CAG (2021), MIG (2020 Best short paper award) Github MIG 2020 Capturing and inferring 3D maps have many applications for Augmented Reality, GIS, urban planning, etc. In collaboration with Intel Movidius, a drone survey of TCD campus was captured in the summer 2017 allowing images and 3D point cloud to be available as open dataset. Dataset Publication: Tara (2017) Webpage Demo Course content Open Science 101 created by Nasa has been published at DOI:10.5281/zenodo.10161526 (CC-BY-4.0) and is web-published locally at: Open Science Information, references and some slides used for research and teaching computer vision and machine learning (e.g. MU module CS410) are shared online. CVML Webpage This github repo shares some of the material (i.e. code in R and Rmd + lecturenotes in pdf and tex) used for teaching Applied Forecasting (5 ECTS) in Trinity College Dublin (2008-2020) for Sophisters. Please give credits if you find these materials useful. Links: Github and Lecturenotes. Github My lecturenotes are available online in html format. These were used for teaching a course (5 ECTS) in Trinity College Dublin (2008-2018) for Sophisters. Please give credits if you find these materials useful. Online book This github repo contains some of the materials used for teaching Bootstrap, Jackknife and other resampling methods (6 contact hours as part of a 5 ECTS Sophister class in Trinity College Dublin, 2005 & 2007). Beamer slides are provided as tex files and the resulting PDF RzDBootstrap.pdf is also available. Github I share several templates on overleaf for writing documents in LaTeX: a Report Template (MU) (an older Report Template (TCD) is also available), the Article Template used in the IMVIP conference and a template for putting together several pdf articles to form a book that has been used for the IMVIP book of proceedings Book of PDFs Template.
