I am also Director of the Cambridge Cybercrime Centre, an interdisciplinary initiative combining expertise from computer science, criminology, and law. We take a data-driven approach to improve our understanding of criminal activity and develop robust identifiers and evidence of criminal behaviour. An important goal of the project is to provide data to other academics and therefore improve the quantity and quality of cybercrime research. Prior to taking up a lectureship I was a researcher at the Computer Laboratory from January 2014 to October 2018, and a College Research Associate at St John's College, Cambridge, from 2017 to 2018. Before moving to Cambridge I was a Senior Research Analyst at the Australian Institute of Criminology from 2011 to 2013. Before entering academia I had a varied research career in local government, parliament, law, and private investigation (intellectual property). I first began researching cybercrime in the late 1990s, while working in industry (mainly relating to domain name misuse and software counterfeiting). Diversity is important to me. I helped set up the department's LGBTQ+@CL network. I also made a list to highlight some academic researchers who do excellent cybercrime research but who I think are under-appreciated. This is not a list of women, it's a list that only has women and non-binary academic researchers on it. Just like some citation lists, editor lists, program committee membership lists, and conference agendas are not lists of (but only include) men. Research interests Current and previous grants include: Interdisciplinary Cybercrime Project (iCrime) (PI), funded by the European Research Council (ERC), 2021-2026. AP4L: Adaptive PETs to Protect & emPower People during Life Transitions (Co-I), funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), 2022-25. COVID-19 Tracking Covid Cybercrime and Abuse (Co-I), funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), 2020-22. CybercrimeNLP (CC-NLP): A natural language processing toolkit for the interdisciplinary analysis of underground online forums (PI), funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), 2020-21. Data science approaches to understanding key actors on online hacking forums (Co-I), funded by the Alan Turing Institute, 2017-18. Cambridge Cybercrime Centre (Co-I), funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), 2015-20. I am an interdisciplinary researcher. Specialising in cybercrime and online harms, I bridge the gap between criminology and computer science. Generally, my research interests include understanding offenders, cybercrime events, and the prevention and disruption of online crime and harms. Specific topics I am particularly interested in include: Applying natural language processing and data science approaches to better understand underground forums. The paper Characterizing Eve: Analysing cybercrime actors in a large underground forum, is the result of a collaboration funded by the Alan Turing Institute. For this project we also compared aggressive language on an online hacking forum with Wikipedia page edits. Developing tools to enrich and enable the use of large, messy, datasets. In particular, we have developed PostCog for researchers using our underground forum data. The use of crime script analysis to understand complex crime types. This methodology has been used to understand the crime commission process of airline ticketing fraud, eWhoring, the illicit online prescription drug trade, and the online stolen data market economy. Understanding policing approaches to complex online crimes, including evaluating their approaches to disrupt DDoS-for-hire markets, understanding complex jurisdictional issues, and comparing their responses to industry-led interventions. Research ethics, which are explored in the papers Ethical issues in research using datasets of illicit origin and Interviewing cybercrime offenders. Stolen data markets, including how actors interact and the actions they perform, how actors trust in inherently untrustworthy situations, disruption and intervention opportunities, and target selection and knowledge transmission.
