I am developing automatized data tools to facilitate data analysis performed by scientists to accelerate scientific discoveries. My research draws on ideas from data management and causal reasoning, making them practical for goal-oriented scientists working with real-life datasets. Before joining the Technion, I was a postdoc researcher in the MIT Data Systems Group and worked with Prof. Michael Cafarella. I obtained my PhD in Computer Science from Tel Aviv University under the supervision of Prof. Tova Milo. I have completed my B.Sc. studies in Computer Science at Ben Gurion University, and my M.Sc. in Computer Science at Tel-Aviv University. Location: Technion, Computer Science Faculty, Taub building. Office: Room 631. E-mail: brity@technion.ac.il PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS I’m seeking strong and motivated Master’s and PhD students to join my Technion lab.
