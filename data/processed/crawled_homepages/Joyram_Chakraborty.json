Specifically, I am interested in user centered design solutions in the areas of internationalization of user interfaces, gaming interface design, m-health, security and digital preservation. Much of research involves experimenting with human subjects to understand user preferences in the interaction with various types of interfaces. I use several data collection methods such as eye tracking, virtual reality, and survey data to better understand the end user. The findings from these studies typically allow for the development of more user friendly and inclusive software. I collaborate closely with researchers from several fields and institutions, namely IBM Research and the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health to develop a better understanding of user requirements that can be useful in the design and development of tools for a global audience.
