My research work is mainly on automated software analysis and performance evaluation of complex software systems in the era of cloud, distributed systems and Internet of Things. My research and my research team - Research Courses that I am teaching - Teaching Research My research interest consists of- Software Engineering, Software Analysis, Software Debugging, Performance Evaluation, Energy Efficiency I am particularly interested in operating system level methods, e.g., execution tracing and profiling, to support the aformentioned topics in the context of IoT, cloud and distributed systems. Currently, I am looking for masters and PhD students, visiting researchers, and postdocs to work with. If your research interests aligns with mine, head over to the “Contact me” page and reach out.
