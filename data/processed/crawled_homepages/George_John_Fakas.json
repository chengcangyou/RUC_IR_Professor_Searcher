Email: georgios.fakas@it.uu.se Bio, Publications, PhD Supervision, Teaching, Uppsala DataBase Laboratory Welcome V�lkommen NEWS Final year projects. If you are interested in doing a database project under my supervision, please have a look on my recent papers first. See if you find them interesting to you then we can discuss a project. Biographical Notes Georgios Fakas (Γεώργιος Φάκας, 佐治.法卡斯) I am an Associate Professor (Docent) at the Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University. I am currently leading the Uppsala DataBase Laboratory (UDBL) within the Department of Information Technology. Before joining Uppsala University, I worked as a Research Fellow at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (with Prof. Dimitris Papadias), Hong Kong University (with Prof. Nikos Mamoulis), EPFL (Lausanne, Switzerland), UMIST (Manchester, UK), University of Cyprus (Cyprus). I also worked as a Senior Lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University (UK). I have published papers in the most influential conferences and journals of data management, including SIGMOD, PVLDB, VLDB Journal, IEEE TKDE, DKE, etc. Education. I obtained my Ph.D. in 1998, my M.Phil. in 1996 and my B.Sc. in Computation in 1995; all from the Department of Computation, UMIST, Manchester, UK. Research Interests.� My research interests include (1) big data; (2) keyword search and ranking on (semi) structure data and (attributed) graphs; (3) web search; (4) online (geo) social networks. I am also interested in (5) workflow management. Other research interests also include Computers in Education, Distance and Collaborative Learning. Awards. In 2023, I received an �International Sabbaticals� grant from Teknat (Disciplinary Domain of Science and Technology, Uppsala University) which was hosted by Boston University, USA. In 2009, I received the fellowship �Hosting of Experienced Researchers from Abroad� from the Research Promotion Foundation (RPF), Cyprus which was hosted by the University Of Cyprus, Cyprus. In 2001, I was awarded the ERCIM (European Research Consortium in Informatics and Mathematics) Fellowship which was hosted by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology - Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland. Current funding eSSENCE, Sweden. Principal Investigator for the project �Data-intensive analytics for discovering critical minerals using Machine Learning�, Call for PhD projects in the eSSENCE graduate school in data-intensive science 2024. In collaboration with streamanalyze.com (Tore Risch) and www.smartexploration.se (Bjarne Almqvist). Professional Activities.
