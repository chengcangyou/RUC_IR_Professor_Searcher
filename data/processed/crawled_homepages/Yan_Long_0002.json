I seek to ensure trustworthy and confidential sensing-based computation in user-device interactions, critical infrastructures, and emerging technologies, with a focus on the hardware-software interfaces. I received my PhD degree from the University of Michigan, EECS where I worked with my PhD advisor Kevin Fu (Fellow of IEEE, ACM, AAAS). I completed my undergraduate study at Zhejiang University, where I worked with Wenyuan Xu (Fellow of IEEE) and Xiaoyu Ji. My research has been recognized by the IEEE S&P Distinguished Paper Award, CPS Rising Stars Award, and IEEE HOST Best PhD Thesis Award, and reported by Fox News, TechRadar, The Register, etc. Research InterestsProtecting user privacy from evolving sensors (IEEE S&P’23, RAID’23) and side-channel problems (IEEE S&P’23, NDSS’24)Modeling the security impact of physcial signals such as acoustics, lasers, electromagentic interference on computer vision (RAID’25, VehicleSec’24), speech processing (IEEE S&P’24), and other sensing systems (NDSS’24)Designing novel sensing software and hardware systems for security (ACM CCS’19, ACM NSPW’22) and healthcare (UbiComp/IMWUT’21)Sensing-related security and privacy problems in Android (WiSec’25), AR/VR, and other emerging mobile computing platforms, as well as DeepFake multimedia.Open-source Project [NEW] ARMOUR: Android Runtime Zero-permission Sensor Usage Monitoring from User Space In ACM WiSec 2025 [Code] [PDF] EM Eye: Eavesdropping on Embedded Cameras In NDSS 2024 [Code] [Website] [PDF] [Talk] Private Eye: Eyeglass Reflection Leaking Screen Contents In IEEE S&P 2023 [Code] [Paper Link] [PDF] [Presentation]News[Aug, 2025] Our work “RF-Eye-D: Probing Feasibility of CMOS Camera Watermarking with Radio-Frequency Injection” is accepted at RAID’25.[🔬 USENIX’26] I will serve on the program committee of USENIX Security 2026.[Mar 17, 2025] I will give a guest lecture at MIT 6.5950/6.5951 Secure Hardware Design.[Feb, 2025] Our work “How Lasers Exploit Photoacoustic and Photoelectric Phenomena to Inject Signals into MEMS Microphones” is accepted by Journal of Hardware and Systems Security.
