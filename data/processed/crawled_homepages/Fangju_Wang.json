Currently I am applying the technique of partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), along with reinforcement learning, to building intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). My work is aimed at developing new techniques/algorithms for handling uncertainties, improving performance, and reducing computing costs. artificial intelligence machine learning reinforcement learning partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) intelligent tutoring system computing efficiency automatic speech recognition Fangju Wang, (2019). \"A Space-Efficient Technique of Policy Trees for an Intelligent Tutoring System on POMDP\".
