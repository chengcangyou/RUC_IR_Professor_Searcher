  "content": "Ellie Pavlick Ellie Pavlick I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Linguistics at Brown University, and a Research Scientist at Google Deepmind. I lead the Language Understanding and Representation (LUNAR) Lab, which seeks to understand how language \"works\" and to build computational models which can understand language the way that humans do. My lab's projects focus on language broadly construed, and often includes the study of capacities more general than language, including conceptual representations, reasoning, learning, and generalization. We are interested in understanding how humans acheive these things, how computational models (especially large language models and similar types of \"black box\" AI systems) achieve these things, and what insights can be gained from comparing the two. We often collaborate with researchers outside of computer science, including cognitive science, neuroscience, and philosophy. For more information on my current research priorities, please visit the LUNAR Lab page. My Google Scholar page is probably the best place to see what my students, collaborators, and I have been up to most recently.",
