His work addresses theoretical and practical challenges in training models under real-world constraints such as decentralization, noise, and privacy. Email Share Prior to joining MBZUAI, Professor Gorbunov was a Postdoctoral Fellow and later a Research Scientist in the Machine Learning Department at MBZUAI. He has also held a research consultancy position at Mila – Quebec AI Institute, collaborating with the group of Professor Gauthier Gidel Professor Gorbunov earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT), where he worked with Professors Alexander Gasnikov and Peter Richtárik on distributed optimization methods, gradient compression, and local update techniques. He also holds a Master’s and Bachelor’s degree in Applied Mathematics and Physics from MIPT. Throughout his academic career, Professor Gorbunov has held research positions at institutions including MIPT, Huawei, Yandex Research, and the Higher School of Economics (HSE). His research has contributed to key developments in stochastic optimization, gradient compression, and learning under heavy-tailed noise. He is the recipient of several prestigious honors, including the Ilya Segalovich Award from Yandex, and multiple Outstanding Reviewer Awards from top-tier conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR. During his studies, he received several competitive scholarships in recognition of his academic excellence.
