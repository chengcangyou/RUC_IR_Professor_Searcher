I lead the Trustworthy Information Systems Lab (TISL). My research areas of interests are computer security, data privacy, optimization, and machine learning. My current research focuses on several aspects of trustworthy machine learning, such as fairness, privacy-preserving machine learning, and explainability. Before my current position, I was a postdoctoral researcher at UQAM, working with Sébastien Gambs on machine learning ethics and privacy. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Université Paul-Sabatier, under the supervision of Marie-José Huguet and Marc-Olivier Killijian. During my Ph.D, I was affiliated to LAAS-CNRS as a member of both Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance and Operations Research, Combinatorial Optimization and Constraints research groups.
