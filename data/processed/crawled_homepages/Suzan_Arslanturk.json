I received my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering and MS and PhD degrees in Computer Science and Informatics in 2011 and 2015, respectively. I have worked as a research scientist for a healthcare consulting company in Michigan while completing my Ph.D. My research focuses on developing novel methodologies and models in predictive analytics for improving clinical performance and enhancing health outcomes using data science. In my lab, we explore various aspects of predictive analytics, including mining large datasets, statistical modeling, and computational intelligence. I collaborate extensively with medical and health professionals, as well as other domain experts, which contributes to the interdisciplinary nature of my publication outlets.
