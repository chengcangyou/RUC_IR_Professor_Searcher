Bldg #300N (Home) 3425 Redpath Montreal, Canada H3G 2G2 ☎ +1(514) 849-1564 Biography. Born in Tienen, Belgium, too long ago. Grew up in Tienen and went to the University of Leuven (Belgium). Got married to Bea. Studied for two years at Osaka University (Japan). Obtained a Ph.D. degree from the University of Texas in 1976 under the supervision of Terry Wagner. Joined the School of Computer Science at McGill University in 1977 as a young snotnose. Recognized by his peers as a slum dog in 2008, an inglorious basterd (sic) in 2009, an artist in 2012, and a parasite in 2019. Thanks to a wonderful bunch of students and colleagues all over the world, still hanging in there. Fighting against income inequality, bureaucracy and (internet) mob justice. Advocating for truly universal healthcare, and free education for all. Will never retire.
