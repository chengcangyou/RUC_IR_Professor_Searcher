In particular, I am interested in understanding how computational limitations influence strategic behavior in multiagent systems, as well as developing approaches to address computational issues which arise in practical applications of multiagent systems. Short Bio I am a professor in the Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. I am affiliated with the AI group. I also currently hold a University Research Chair and the Pasupalak AI Fellowship, and am a Faculty Affiliate with the Vector Institute. I completed my Ph.D in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. My undergraduate degree was in mathematics from Memorial University of Newfoundland.
