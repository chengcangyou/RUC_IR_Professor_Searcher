Follow Office: COM1 #03-16 National University of Singapore Email Google Scholar ORCID I am an Associate Professor at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore. My interests include research in systems and system security, the social and economics aspects of cyber security, and education. Iâm leading the Curiosity Reserach Group with the following ultimate missions: Understand systems (çè§£ç³»ç»), Abstract knowledge (æç¼ç¥è¯), Connect facts (åæè§å¾). Be interesting people, do meaningful work is the ethos we live by. We strive to embody this ethos: to think deeply, collaborate openly, and act purposefully, seeking elegance in thought and meaning in action. I am also the co-lead Principal Investigator of National Cybersecurity R&D Laboratory (NCL) of Singapore. In NCL, we carry out research, development, and support for cyber experimentation and cyber exercise. I am looking for curious minds to join our journey. If you share the same passion, please do not hesitate to reach me. Curiosity is required, while skill and mindset for repairing things (such as bicycles) is a plus. Positions are available at all levels, from undergraduate researcher/interns, Master/Ph.D. students, and postdoc research fellows. Updates September 2025.
