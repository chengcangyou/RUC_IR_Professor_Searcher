Biography Robert received a DPhil in Computer Science from the University of York in 1995. Since then he has founded three start-up companies, all of which have succeeded in transferring real-time systems research into commercial product. At Northern Real-Time Technologies Ltd. (1995-1997) he was responsible for development of the Volcano Controller Area Network (CAN) software library. This technology has since been widely used in the automotive industry, by companies including: Volvo, Jaguar, Landrover, Aston Martin, Mazda, SAIC and others. (See the Volcano Impact Case Study White Paper.) At LiveDevices Ltd. (1997-2001) he was responsible for development of the Real-Time Architect suite of products, including a highly efficient, single-stack Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) Today, OSEK and Autosar compliant derivatives of this RTOS are used by the majority of the worlds leading automotive manufacturers and suppliers (See the RTOS Impact Case Study White Paper.) In 2002, Robert returned to research at the University of York, initially working in the Advanced Computer Architectures Group on AURA pattern matching technology. Robert was responsible for developing a new version of the AURA library, achieving a 3-fold improvement in both search times and memory requirement. Today the AURA library is used extensively in resea",
