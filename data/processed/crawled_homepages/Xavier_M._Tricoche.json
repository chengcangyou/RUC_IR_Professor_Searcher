The goal of his research is to create algorithms and tools that facilitate the visual exploration and analysis of increasingly large and complex data. In particular, he applies topological and differential geometric concepts to the visualization of phenomena controlled by dynamical systems, such as fluid flows and planetary systems. Dr. Tricoche also designs methods for the structural analysis of medical imaging data and create specialized data representation and reconstruction techniques for large scale applications. Tricoche's work is fundamentally multi-disciplinary and he always welcome new collaborations.",
