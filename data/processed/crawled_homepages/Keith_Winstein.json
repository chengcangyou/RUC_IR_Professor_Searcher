His research group creates new kinds of networked systems by rethinking abstractions around communication, compression, and computing. Some of his group's research has found broader use, including the Mosh tool, the Puffer video-streaming site, the Lepton compression tool, the Mahimahi network emulators, and the gg lambda-computing framework. He has been listed on the Stanford Tau Beta Pi Teaching Honor Roll and received the ACM SIGCOMM Rising Star Award, the Sloan Research Fellowship, the NSF CAREER Award, the Usenix NSDI Community Award (2024, 2020, 2017), the Usenix NSDI Outstanding Paper Award, the Usenix ATC Best Paper Award, the Applied Networking Research Prize, the ACM SIGCOMM Doctoral Dissertation Award, and a Sprowls PhD thesis award in computer science at MIT. Winstein previously served as a staff reporter at The Wall Street Journal and worked at Ksplice, a startup company (now part of Oracle) where he was the vice president of product management and business development and also cleaned the bathroom. He did his undergraduate and graduate work at MIT. CV: Here is my CV.

Research July 2025: Gina Yuan, Thea Rossman, and KW, Internet Connection Splitting: Whatâs Old is New Again In the 1990s, many networks deployed performance-enhancing proxies (PEPs) that transparently split TCP connections to aid performance, especially over lossy, long-delay paths. Two recent developments have cast doubt on their relevance: the BBR congestion-control algorithm, which de-emphasizes loss as a congestion signal, and the QUIC transport protocol, which prevents transparent connection-splitting yet empirically matches or exceeds TCPâs performance in wide deployment, using the same congestion control. In light of this, are PEPs obsolete? This paper presents a range of emulation measurements indicating: âprobably not.â While BBRâs original 2016 version didnât benefit markedly from connection-splitting, more recent versions of BBR do and, in some cases, even more so than earlier âloss-basedâ congestion-control algorithms.

April 2024: Gina Yuan, Matthew Sotoudeh, David K. Zhang, Michael Welzl, David MaziÃ¨res, and KW, Sidekick: In-Network Assistance for Secure End-to-End Transport Protocols, NSDI 2024 (won Community Award and Outstanding Paper Award). The challenge: old transport protocols (like TCP) benefit from performance-enhancing proxies (PEPs) that transparently split TCP connections in the network. But these proxies have prevented TCP from adding new features. To prevent this, new transport protocols (like QUIC) are fully encrypted—no proxy can transparently meddle with them. This guarantees evolvability at the cost of performance. Gina's paper shows a way to get the best of both worlds: It may be possible to create a “universal PEP” that works with arbitrary, pre-existing transport protocols (even fully encrypted ones). The PEP assists endpoints over an adjacent “sidekick” connection. The core technical challenge: how can the PEP efficiently refer to ranges of packets of a fully encrypted connection. Some linear algebra makes this possible, compromising between size on the wire, computation for the proxy and endpoint, and ability to recover from loss. Once endpoints are getting information from the PEP, there are some fun questions about how that should influence their behavior. We created a \"path-aware\" congestion-control scheme whose response to packet loss considers where loss occurred along the path. When assisted by a universal PEP, it's possible for an endpoint emulate the performance of \"split\" TCP pretty closely.

November 2022: Yuhan Deng, Angela Montemayor, Amit Levy, and KW, Computation-Centric Networking, HotNets 2022. Yuhan is leading a project to create a new kind of OS and an environment for computation that we call \"computation-centric networking.\" The core principles are a separation between I/O and compute (with delineated nondeterminism), a common notion of correctness, and fine-grained visibility into application dataflow. This suggests an end-to-end argument for serverless computing, shifting the service model from ârenting CPUs by the secondâ to âproviding the unambiguously correct result of a computation.â Accountability to these higher-level abstractions could permit agility and innovation on other axes.

Zhang, Matthew Sotoudeh, Michael Welzl, and KW, Sidecar: In-Network Performance Enhancements in the Age of Paranoid Transport Protocols, HotNets 2022 Is it possible to get the anti-ossification benefits of a fully encrypted transport protocol (like QUIC), and without changing anything about the protocol's wire format, also get the benefits of in-network acceleration?
