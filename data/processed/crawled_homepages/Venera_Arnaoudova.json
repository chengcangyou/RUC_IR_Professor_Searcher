I am an Associate Professor at Washington State University in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). I am currently the Associate Director of the School of EECS and a Voiland College’s inaugural Dean’s Faculty Fellow. Previously, I had the opportunity to work as a postdoctoral research fellow with Dr. Andrian Marcus at The University of Texas at Dallas. I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering in 2014 from Polytechnique Montréal (Canada) under the supervision of Dr. Giuliano Antoniol and Dr. Yann-Gaël Guéhéneuc. In 2008, I received my master degree in Computer Science from Concordia University (Montréal, Canada). In 2006, I received my bachelor degree in Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Automation from Polytech’Lille (Lille, France). My research interest is in the domain of software engineering and particularly, software evolution, empirical software engineering, program comprehension, analysis of source code lexicon and documentation, refactoring, patterns, and anti-patterns.
