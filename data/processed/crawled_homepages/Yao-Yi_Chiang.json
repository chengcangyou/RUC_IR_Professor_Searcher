Reach me by email at yaoyichi@gmail.com or yaoyi@umn.edu. I work on Spatial AI topics. I am interested in developing data-driven methods that can take advantage of domain knowledge to solve complex problems. For example, we built machine learning algorithms that incorporate spatial science techniques for air quality prediction and imagery recognition. I also enjoy building working systems with my students and doing consulting work related to my research. I used to teach data mining, advanced spatial computing, spatial databases, and geospatial data integration at USC.
