From 2002 to 2004, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the Max-Planck-Institut fÃ¼r Informatik, SaarbrÃ¼cken, Germany. Currently, he is a (full) professor with the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Ottawa, Canada, where he is a member of the VIVA laboratory and the Distributed and Collaborative Virtual Environments Research Laboratory (DISCOVER). His research interest is focused on physics-based and data driven modeling for computer graphics and computer vision. He is working on visual tracking, image-based models, virtual environments and computational photography.
