This is a joint work with UNIST. Thanks, Arooba, Satbek, Hyeongi, and Jooyong! Proactive Debugging of Memory Leakage Bugs in Single Page Web Applications, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, Vol. 51, No. 7, pp. 1969-1995. I am ranked among the Top-20 most impactful SE researchers (consolidators) in a recent paper. I received two ACM Distinguished Paper Awards: ICSE 2013 and ASE 2023. I am looking for talented students (All levels: Ph.D., Master, Undergraduate Interns). Please send your CV if you are interested. Google Scholar DBLP CV About me I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Korea University. Currently, I am leading the PALM (Program Analysis, Learning, and Mining) Group. PALM is recruiting talented postdocs and graduate students who are interested in automated software debugging, repository mining, testing, game testing, simulator fuzzing, web/mobile app testing and related topics. I am also looking for research assistant and interns (undergraduate students) who are willing to work on crazy ideas. Send me your CV if you are interested. View More Research The PALM (Program Analysis, Learning, and Mining) Group works on devising novel techniques to address SE4AI (Software Engineering for AI challenges) and AI4SE (AI for Software Engineering challenges). The techniques include but are not limited to: software testing, program mining, program analysis based on machine learning, automated program debugging, and program optimization. We are applying the techniques to broad applications such as video games, simulators, and web/mobile apps. Our research results are published in top-tier international conferences and journals. We actively work together with leading researchers worldwide, including universities in Luxembourg, the UK, Germany, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan. Program Debugging Program Analysis Software Testing Recruitment (Link to the Korean version: íì ëª¨ì§) The PALM (Program Analysis, Learning, and Mining) Group is recruiting talented postdocs, graduate students, and undergrad research interns, who would like to work on program analysis, software repository mining, and automated testing/debugging. Please send me your CV if you are interested in joining PALM. Research Topics You can work on the following topics, but not limited to: Program analysis Software engineering Automated program repair/debugging Automated software testing Software repository mining Game super testing Simulator testing Mobile/Web app testing GUI/Media testing Fuzzing Secure software Finance system testing Quantum program testing AI4SE (Artificial Intelligence for Software Engineering) SE4AI (Software Engineering for Artificial Intelligence) Your Motivation If any of the following cases motivates you, you need to consider joining PALM! I want to solve the challenges of program debugging! How about making a program fix other programs? â ICSE 2013 with ACM Best Paper Award Can we automatically collect fix patterns for better program repair? â TSE 2021 Can we fix a bug before detecting it? â ASE 2023 with ACM Best Paper Award I want to help developers in the world! Public code search engines are not helpful to find code examples I need. How about automatically reasoning about better search terms? â EMSE 2018, ICSE 2018 Why is naming my functions so hard? â EMSE 2016, ICSE 2019, TOSEM 2025 I want to make a breakthrough for program analysis! Can we fix bugs in reactive programs automatically? â ISSTA 2024 Can we predict more serious bugs earlier? â TSE 2011 I want to improve vibe coding! How can we build a better training dataset for CodeLLMs? â ASE 2024 Do CodeLLMs memorize my secret? â ICSE 2024 Fixed Bugs by Our Tools Our tools automatically generate patches to fix many bugs of several open-source projects. We have submitted pull requests with our patches. The following is the list of our patches accepted by developers. Fixing blocking-call bugs in reactive applications (ISSTA 2024).
