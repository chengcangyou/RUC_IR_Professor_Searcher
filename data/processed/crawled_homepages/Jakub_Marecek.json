The elements of the set are known as feasible solutions and the criterion is known as the objective function. Over the past couple of centuries, much of the work in mathematical optimization has focussed on the case of a convex, time-invariant set of feasible solutions and convex, time-invariant objective functions. This special case has become the work horse of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and most fields of engineering.Research FocusIn our basic research, we focus study extensions towards (1) certain smooth, non-convex feasible sets and objective functions and (2) time-varying feasible sets and objective functions. The smooth non-convex problems, known as commutative and non-commutative polynomial optimization, have extensive applications in power systems, control theory, and machine learning, among others. The same applications can often benefit from the time-varying extensions. Particular examples of the former (1) include our paper at AAAIÂ 2024 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04469), which deals with smoothing of a non-smooth non-convex optimization problem and our papers at AAAIÂ 2021 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07315), in the Journal of AIÂ Research (https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05274), and IEEEÂ Transactions on Automatic Control (https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01444)Â deal with non-commutative polynomial optimization. Notably, we can get the present best results on the COMPASÂ dataset. Particular examples of the latter (2) include our papers at AAAI 2019 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05870) and AAAI 2020Â (https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03550),Â as well as recent papers in SIAMÂ Journal on Optimization and Mathematics of OR.Independent of this, in a series of papers in Automatica (e.g., https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03256, https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03001, https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06767) and IJCÂ (https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13273), we are working on the control on non-linear systems under uncertainty in modelling repeated uses of AIÂ systems, control problems in sharing economy, etc. Latest ProjectsExplore all projectsâOptimizationTENORSSeveral Ph.D. positions are available within Marie SkÅodowska-Curie Doctoral Network for tensor modeling, geometry and optimization.March 8, 2024Read moreâOptimizationCoDietHorizon Europe project aiming to combat diet-related diseases through innovative diet-monitoring technologies, AI-assisted data analysis and personalized nutrition.August 23, 2023Read moreâOptimizationAutoFair (Human-Compatible AI with Guarantees)Horizon Europe project for fair AI algorithms supported by the EU with 3,8 million Euros.

A few more formal steps will be needed, but the regulation will be in force before the European Parliament elections in June 2024. And after transitional periods (from 6 to 36 months, depending on the risks), it will come into effect.ArticleJanuary 27, 2024Read moreâBy clicking âAccept All Cookiesâ, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.PreferencesDenyAccept Privacy Preference CenterWhen you visit websites, they may store or retrieve data in your browser.
