Computer Science and Bachelor of Innovation Engineering Building, Room 188 University of Colorado at Colorado Springs 1420 Austin Bluffs Parkway Colorado Springs, CO 80918 Email rlewis5[at]uccs.edu Dr. Rory A. Lewis is the Program Director of the Master of Science in Computer Science and a senior researcher in artificial intelligence, computational neuroscience, and autonomous systems. He has received multiple Outstanding Achievement: Professor of the Year awards from the College of Engineering and Applied Science, as well as the Diversity & Inclusiveness Award: âInnovations in Scholarship for Inclusiveness.â Dr. Lewis was named Outstanding Achievement: Inventor of the Year at the University of Colorado for pioneering advances in computational neuroscience, and is a Daniels Fund Ethics Initiative Faculty Fellow. He has delivered 59 keynote and technical addresses at national and international conferences and served as a panelist on 67 NSF and NIH panels selecting recipients for AI, robotics in medicine, neurosurgery, and robotic sentience projects with direct relevance to national defense applications. Dr. Lewisâ time in Special Forces led his research to Delta Forces (@MIT labs and Fort Bragg), 10th Group Green Berets (Colorado), ISR at the Pentagon, and POCs to federally funded research for State Department Operators, including serving as Principal Investigator for the $891,750 Multivariate Algorithms for Optimized Test Heuristics and Real-Time Analysis (MAOTHRA) project for the Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) at the C4I and SIS Test Technology Area where he optimized C4I system testing and validated CRAD–to–PoR performance during live-fire operational trials at Redstone Arsenal. At the Pentagon, where he holds a Top Secret–Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS–SCI) Clearance, his research centers on AI for ISR and military AI systems for combat medical instrumentation. He has also served as Senior Research Scientist in AI at RAND Corporation and as a Fellow at Warfighters Edge Research Laboratories (USAF/Pentagon) since 2017, advancing coordination and survivability strategies for autonomous special forces assets. Dr. Lewis has delivered keynote addresses at international and defense-focused venues including: (i) The Sixth International Conference on Neuroscience & Cognitive Brain Information (BRAININFO), Nice, France, on AI-driven sentience and common-sense reasoning; (ii) The Convergence of Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things, Palo Alto, CA, on DNNs, GPUs, and artificial consciousnessâattended by Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google; and (iii) the 2nd Annual Autonomous Capabilities for DoD Summit, Maryland, briefing senior DoD leadership on AI and medical robotic sentience in comparative defense and civilian research contexts (details). He has preformed additional research jointly at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs and the neuroICU ward at the Anschutz Medical Campus. Previous positions include research appointments at Warsaw University . Dr. Lewisâs technical expertise spans programming and scripting in Python, C++, MATLAB, JavaScript (including Three.js, OrbitControls, and TextGeometry), PHP, SQL, and HTML5/CSS3; advanced 3D visualization and simulation with Three.js and Vite for MATLAB-style gradient surfaces, dynamic multi-angle labeling systems, and interactive camera controls; backend integration with MySQL, JSON APIs, PHP, and Node.js; and development tooling including VS Code, Git/GitHub, npm, and local dev servers. He has planned and executed enhancements such as database-driven surface generation, Python preprocessing for normalization, and AI-assisted visualization pipelines. Before his career in academia, Dr. Lewis graduated from Syracuse Universityâs L.C. Smith College of Engineering with a degree in Computer and Electrical Engineering, then earned his Juris Doctor from Syracuse University College of Law, specializing in high-technology litigation. He worked at Fulbright & Jaworski, in San Francisco where he engaged in litigation over stolen electrical circuitry embedded in advanced microprocessors. This work required deconstructing and analyzing proprietary logic designs, bus architectures, and fabrication schematics to prove intellectual property theft in high-profile disputes, including Intel v. AMD. The Solvay International Conference This photo of the attendees at 5th Solvay International Conference in October 1927 is highly regarded as the \"most intelligent picture ever taken.\"\" Founded by the Belgian industrialist Ernest Solvay, this 5th conference is considered as the turning point as the worldâs most notable physicists met to discuss the newly formulated quantum theory. The leading figures were Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr 17 of the 29 attendees were or became Nobel Prize winners.
