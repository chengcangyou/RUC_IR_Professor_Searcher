My research focuses on Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC), Zero Knowledge proofs, and Oblivious Data Structures. I am broadly interested in algorithmic techniques for reducing the cost of powerful cryptographic methods. To learn more about my research, you can peruse my work below or have a look at my CV.
