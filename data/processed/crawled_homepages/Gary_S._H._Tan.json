Tan Associate Professor and Vice Dean, Student Life email: gtan@comp.nus.edu.sg Tel: (65) 6516 6276 Gary Tan was a pioneer in the Direct Honours Programme of the National University of Singapore and received his B.Sc (1st class Honours) from NUS. He received his M.Sc and Ph.D from the University of Manchester , U.K. He has been lecturing at the School of Computing , National University of Singapore since 1990, and was the recipient of Teaching Awards of the Faculty of Science in both 1992 and 1998, the Teaching Excellence Awards from the School in 1999 and 2002, and the NUS Annual Teaching Excellence Award for 03/04, 04/05 and 06/07. He is also on the ATEA Honour roll for 2008. His research interests include parallel and distributed computing, scheduling and load balancing, declarative multiprocessors, parallel and distributed (interactive) simulation and High Level Architecture. He is currently working on Digital Twins, Crisis Simulation and Traffic Simulation. He has served as Chair of the NUS PROSE committee, a cross-faculty agency tasked with promoting the use of good English in the University. He was also a Resident Fellow of Kent Ridge Hall (1993-2003), and was Master of Sheares Hall (2003-2013). He is now Vice Dean of Student Life at the school and Master of the College of Alice & Peter Tan. He has had project collaborations with KTH (Royal Institute of Technology),Sweden, and FOI (Swedish Defence Research Agency), and is a collaborator with SMART, and Beihang University. He serves on the program committee of Distributed Simulation and Real-time Systems Symposium, and is on the Editorial Board of the Journal of Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory (Elsevier) and International Journal of Modelling, Simulation, and Scientific Computing (World Scientific). He is a member of ASIASIM federation, and was Co-chair of AsiaSim2013 and Asiasim2019, both held in Singapore in November 2013 and October 2019 respectively. He was Program Chair of DSRT 2016 held in London, and Conference Co-chair of SIMUTOOLS 2016 held in Prague. He is President of the Society of Simulation and Gaming of Singapore (SSAGsg).
