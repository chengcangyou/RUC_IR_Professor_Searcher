He received a Ph.D. in Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization (ACO) from Georgia Tech in 2011 and a docent (aka habilitation) in Computer Science from KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden, in 2017. [more]His research focuses on graph algorithms and computational complexity, with particular interest in developing algorithmic techniques that are effective across a range of computational models. He has contributed to efficient algorithms for fundamental graph problems, such as connectivity and distances, in settings ranging from sequential to distributed and dynamic algorithms.(If you're introducing me, you can stop here or talk about one of my papers if you like.
