Dr. Pike has held a research grant from NSERC to study problems in combinatorial design theory and graph theory since 1999 and has also received grants from CFI and NSERC for high performance computing equipment. His research has involved colourings of cycle systems and designs, structural properties of block-intersection graphs of combinatorial designs, existential closure of graphs, as well as computational problems in combinatorics. Dr. Pike is currently a Vice-President of the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications, and recently served as a Vice-President of the Canadian Mathematical Society.
