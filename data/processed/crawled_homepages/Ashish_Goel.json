I also use techniques from optimization, probability, stochastics, and game theory in my research. I like to get deep into applications, with the goal being tangible impact in the application domain, not just collaborations with practitioners or papers in applied venues. Current application interests include Social Networks and Social Algorithms; Social Choice and Crowdsourced Democracy; Dating platforms; Internet Commerce; Reputation, Recommendation, and Trust Systems; Algorithms for large scale data processing. In addition to advancing technology, I am also excited about developing algorithms that improve how we interact with each other and the networked world around us. I have also spent significant time in industry, including Twitter (brief writeup) , Teapot (acquired by Stripe), and Stripe. Our research group has developed two widely used social choice platforms: The Stanford Participatory Budgeting Platform and The Stanford Online Deliberation Platform . My background is in algorithms, and my earlier applications were in core computer science topics: networks, molecular self-assembly, search, advertising, and social networks. Why am I studying social choice now? Short Bio Affiliations The Operations Research group in MS&E Theoretical Computer Science The Social Algorithms Lab .
