My 2013 thesis was titled \"Sub-Polyhedral Compilation using (Unit-)Two-Variables-Per-Inequality Polyhedra\", in which I addressed the problem of improvement of scalability of algorithms that are used in loop-parallelization. My thesis used techniques from polyhedral compilation, abstract interpretation, combinatorial optimization and graph theory. I have a M.S from Colorado State University, USA, an M.Tech in Computer Science from Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore and a B.E in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Andhra University, Visakhapatnam. I have been at IITH since March-2014. Earlier, I was a visiting scientist at IISc, a research engineer at INRIA, Paris, a research scholar at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, USA and a compiler engineer in Hewlett Packard. Research Interests My broad research is in Programming Languages and Compilers. More specifically, these are the following research areas I am currently working on. Domain Specific Programming Languages for Parallelization: Building Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) and compilation strategies for applications from various domains. An example is Big-Data applications and High-Performance Computing. We have funding for this. LLVM Optimizations: Various aspects of the open-source LLVM compiler. We are working in collaboration with various industries on this. I also run the IITH-LLVM group. Join the Group (only with IITH email-IDs) Coarse/Fine-Grain Compiler Optimization and Parallelization techniques for modern architectures for multi-core/GPUs: Proposal of new parallelization algorithms and improvement of the range of programs that are amenable to parallelization schemes in existing polyhedral compilation tools. As an example, I am interested in the range of programs that could be accepted by the well known polyhedral compilation tools like Pluto and Polly. Improvement of Scalability of Tools in Polyhedral Compilation The above mentioned polyhedral compilation tools use expensive tools that limit their scalability. I am interested in improving their scalability using advanced approximations like (U)TVPI sub-polyhedra, similar and more powerful to our POPL-2013 paper. Abstract Interpretation and sub-polyhedral approximations: Abstract interpretation is a formal framework to perform static analysis of programs. It was formalized by the classic work of Cousot-Cousot in the 1970s. Since then, there have been advances, with the Astrée static analyzer being one of its largest successes. It uses a variety of sub-polyhedral approximations; for example Antoine Miné's Octagon domain. I am interested in various aspects of scalability vs. precision issues of these approximations, with a particular focus in loop-programs (Affine Control Programs/SCoPs). Any aspects of program analysis. ... Selected Publications Current (TBD) Earlier Ramakrishna Upadrasta and Albert Cohen. Sub-polyhedral scheduling using (unit-)two-variable-per-inequality polyhedra.
