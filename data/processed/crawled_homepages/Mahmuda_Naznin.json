I served as the Head of the department of CSE, BUET for the last  two years. I found the headship as the first female Head in the Faculty of EEE a quiet valuable administrative leadership experience. I feel it added learning ability, self capacity building, courage, and confidence for career advancement. As a part of the team I got the opportunity to learn and share.  My research interest includes  Machine Learning/Deep Learning, Cognitive Science,  Medical Imaging,  Human Centric System, and Network and Systems. My PhD supervisor was Prof. Kendall E. Nygard (NDSU, USA), MS supervisor was Dr. Paul Juell (NDSU, USA), and M.Sc. Engineering supervisor was Prof. Md. Saidur Rahman (CSE, BUET). Personal View- Be Human- H (Honor/Help Others)-U (Uplift Others)-M (Munificent )- A (Appreciate Others)- N (Nurture Kindness for Others)   My  Erdös Number is 4- Mahmuda Naznin-->Kendall E.
