Naesseth I am an Assistant Professor of Machine Learning at the University of Amsterdam, a member of the Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab, the lab manager of the UvA-Bosch Delta Lab 2, and an ELLIS member. My research interests span generative modeling, uncertainty quantification, reasoning, and machine learning, as well as their application to the sciences. I am currently working on generative models (diffusions, flows, generative flow networks, …), approximate inference (variational and Monte Carlo methods), probabilistic modelling (natural sciences, computer vision, health, etc.), uncertainty quantification and hypothesis testing (E-values, conformal prediction, …). Previously, I was a postdoctoral research scientist with David Blei at the Data Science Institute, Columbia University. I completed my PhD in Electrical Engineering at Linköping University, advised by Fredrik Lindsten and Thomas Schön. News Oct 22, 2025 TMLR announces new Journal-to-Conference track and certifications. The lab and collaborators are excited to present two J2C certified papers (top 10%): Variational Pseudo Marginal Methods for Jet Reconstruction in Particle Physics E-Valuating Classifier Two-Sample Tests Oct 6, 2025 The lab welcomes Markus Mueller, a visiting PhD student from Erasmus University Rotterdam.
