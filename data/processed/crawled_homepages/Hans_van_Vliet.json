I worked as a researcher at the Dutch National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science (CWI) until 1987. During 1983-84, I spent a year as a visiting scientist at the IBM Research Laboratory in San Jose, California. I am a professor of Software Engineering at the Vrije Universiteit since 1987. I wrote my first (Dutch) text book in 1984. The latest edition is published by Wiley & Sons in 2008: Software Engineering; Principles and Practice. My main research interests are in software architecture, knowledge management in software development, global software development, and empirical software engineering. I was program co-chair of the Second Working IEEE/IFIP Conference on Software Architecture, held in Amsterdam, August 28-31, 2001 (WICSA2001), and the general chair of the ESEC/FSE conference on Software Engineering, that took place in Amsterdam, August 2009. I was the Editor in Chief of the Journal of Systems and Software from 2008 till 2017, and am a member of IFIP WG2.10 on Software Architecture. See my list of publications for further information.",
