Currently, we are focused on computational methods of data mining, modeling and simulation in genomics and molecular systems biology (e.g. single-cell \"omics\" data analysis, signaling pathways, gene regulatory networks), which can be used to accelerate knowledge discovery in life sciences (e.g. stem cell based regenerative medicine, ageing diseases and cancer therapeutics and drug discovery, etc.).
