My research interests lie at the intersection of computer networking, systems, and machine learning. I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in 2019 where I was advised by Brighten Godfrey. I am also an Amazon Scholar with the Amazon Prime Video team. I lead the Networking, Systems, and AI Lab (NetSAIL) at UCI. My current focus revolves around: - Internet and Cloud Resilience - Systems and Machine Learning News 11/25: Our work on the impact of solar storms on LEO satellite networks was featured in New Scientist! 10/25: Invited talk at the UC Berkeley Sky Seminar on \"Towards Trustworthy Learning-Enabled Networked Systems.\" 09/25: ArachNet accepted at HotNets '25. 09/25: Invited talk at Amazon Kuiper on \"Network Resilience in Space: Solar Storm Impacts on LEO Satellite Networks.\" 09/25: Dave Täht Outstanding Paper Award at LEO-NET '25! 07/25: Thrilled to receive the NSF CAREER Award! 04/25: Agua accepted at SIGCOMM '25. 02/25: Invited talk at the ESNet Data and AI workshop at Berkeley on \"Opening the Black Box: Explainability for Learning-Enabled Systems\". 12/24: Best paper award at ACM CoNEXT '24! 10/24: Phoenix accepted at ASPLOS '25. 09/24: Concept-based explainability accepted at HotNets '24. 09/24: Plume accepted at CoNEXT '24. 05/24: Interviewed for a Scientific American article about the May 2024 solar storm. 05/24: StellaTrain accepted at SIGCOMM'24. 04/24: Invited Talk at UIUC SysNet Retreat on \"Cross-Layer Internet Resilience under Planetary-Scale Risks\". 12/23: LinguaLinked, our distributed LLM inference system for mobile devices, was featured in the New Scientist magazine. 12/23: Xaminer accepted at SIGMETRICS '24. 12/23: CrystalBox accepted at AAAI '24. 09/23: Nautilus accepted at SIGMETRICS '24. 08/23: Invited talk at the Indian Institute of Science on Understanding Internet Resilience to Planetary-Scale Risks. 06/23: Intereviewed for an article in the Washington Post on Internet resilience under solar storms. 05/23: Alagappan Ramanathan was selected as a Pulse Research Fellow by the Internet Society. 08/22: Interviewed for a BBC article on computer errors from space. 06/22: Honored to be selected as N2Women Rising Star in Networking and Communications. 04/22: cISP appeared at NSDI '22. 03/22: Thrilled to receive the IETF/IRTF Applied Networking Research Prize for my work on Internet resilience under solar superstorms.
