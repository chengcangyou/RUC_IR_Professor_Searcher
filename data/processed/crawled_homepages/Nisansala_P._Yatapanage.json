Please see my website for full details about my research. Biography I have been a Senior Lecturer at ANU since January 2025 and a Lecturer from 2022 to 2024. My current research is on concurrency verification using rely/guarantee, separation logics and temporal logic. I joined ANU in 2020, working on a project on the verification of security protocols, with Assoc. Prof. Alwen Tiu. Prior to ANU, I was a Senior Lecturer/Lecturer at De Montfort University, Leicester, U.K., from 2017 to 2019. Before that, I worked with Prof. Cliff Jones at Newcastle University, U.K., from 2013 to 2017. I received my PhD in 2012 from Griffith University, supervised by Dr. Kirsten Winter from UQ. From 2011 to 2013, I worked on a project on the verification of an air-traffic control system at The University of Queensland. Prior to doing my PhD, from 2004 to 2007, I was a researcher in the ARC Centre for Complex Systems and Griffith University, working on specification and verification for safety-critical systems using the Behavior Tree language and model checking. bars search times",
