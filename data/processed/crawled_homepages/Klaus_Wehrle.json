He received his diploma (1999) and his doctorate (Dr.-Ing., 2002) from the University of Karlsruhe (now KIT), both with distinction. His doctoral thesis on flexible and scalable Quality of Service mechanisms for the next generation Internet was awarded the Doctoral Dissertation Prize of SÃ¼dwestmetall and the FZI Doctoral Dissertation Prize (Research Center for Information Technology, FZI).In 2002 and 2003, Klaus was a postdoctoral fellow at the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California at Berkeley (UCB). In 2004, he received a DFG Emmy Noether (starting) grant to establish a junior research group on protocol engineering and distributed systems at the University of TÃ¼bingen. In 2006 he joined RWTH Aachen University as an associate professor, since 2010 as a full professor. From 2019 to 2022 he will be acting head of the Department of Computer Science at RWTH Aachen University.His research activities focus on (but are not limited to) the engineering of network protocols, (formal) methods for protocol engineering and network analysis, network simulation, reliable communication software, and all operating system issues of networking. His research is mainly funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG), the European Research Council (through an ERC Consolidator Grant in 2014, an ERC PoC grant in 2020 and an ERC Synergy Grant in 2025), the EU, the German government (BMBF, BMWi), the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), and industrial partners. From 2015 to 2023 he was coordinating the DFG Priority Program on Cyber-Physical Networking. He is a member of IEEE, ACM, Sigcomm, GI (Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Informatik), VDE and GI/ITG-Fachgruppe KuVS. He was/is a member of several evaluation boards of the Alexander-von-Humboldt Foundation and serves as an elected representative for communication systems at the German Research Foundation (DFG).Email / Exam PolicyExam Dates and Procedure:Dates for oral exams are offered biweekly, every second Wednesday from 3pm till 6pm.If you plan to do an oral exam, please follow this procedure:reserve a slot in advance at the COMSYS office (office@comsys.rwth-aachen.de) with mentioning your study program and the planned lectures to be examined. We will confirm the combination subsequently. Please download our examination sheet, fill it in, and keep it till you exam date. confirm the exam slot latest four weeks ahead of your exam at the COMSYS office (office@comsys.rwth-aachen.de). but be sure, that you are well prepared for the exam at that time. if you plan to have an oral exam with two professors, please check first the availability of slots with the ComSys office and then find a joint date with the other examiner. Then book the final date at the ComSys office. after reserving a slot please register at ZPA (Central Exam Registry, Zentrales PrÃ¼fungsamt) for the oral exam! As for all other exams, a registration with ZPA is mandatory before the exam date. Note that on our examination sheet you have to sign that you are registered with ZPA. bring the examination sheet with you on the exam day, and hand it over to us at the beginning of the exam.
