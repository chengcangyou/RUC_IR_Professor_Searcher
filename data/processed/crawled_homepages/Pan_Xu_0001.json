I obtained a Ph.D. in Operations Research from Iowa State University (2012) and a second Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Maryland, College Park (2019).My research develops theoretical foundations for algorithms with a focus on randomized algorithms, online decision-making, and optimization under uncertainty. I am particularly interested in structured stochastic optimization and online algorithms for matching, allocation, and learning in dynamic environments.Research InterestsOverall, my work lies at the intersection of Algorithms, Operations Research, and Artificial Intelligence. I am especially interested in randomized algorithm design and analysis for stochastic optimization problems arising from both classical theoretical models—such as online matching, secretary problems, prophet inequalities, and multi-armed bandits—and practical applications in E-commerce, internet advertising, crowdsourcing markets, data mining, databases, and revenue management.My recent research primarily focuses on the following directions:Variance analysis and risk-sensitive guarantees for online algorithmsAlgorithm design and analysis for online submodular and coverage maximizationPromoting fairness and equity in online resource allocation and online-matching marketsAs a first-generation scholar, I am strongly committed to mentoring students from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds.Here is the link to my Google Scholar.Contact MeEmail: pxu AT njit DOT eduGoogle SitesReport abuseGoogle SitesReport abuse",
