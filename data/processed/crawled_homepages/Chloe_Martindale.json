My current research is focussed on post-quantum cryptography, with a special focus on isogeny-based cryptography. See this article for a gentle general audience introduction to isogeny-based cryptography (comes with a warning that this was written before SIDH was broken), or see these slides for my short course on CSIDH. There are many more resources to learn about isogeny-based cryptography on the website of the isogeny school from 2021.
