The main applications for my research activities focus on enhancing traditional fields of telerobotics, assistive technology, and intelligent environments by leveraging visual computing. I am generally interested in investigating the applications of basic imagery in conjunction with artificial intelligence tools to implement efficient communication frameworks for human-computer-robot interaction, interactive gaming, and virtual reality. Interested Students I am currently looking for motivated graduate students (both Masters and Doctoral levels) who are interested in the areas of my research. Please browse my research activities, projects, and publications, and contact me if you are interested in joining my research team.

In the past, I have taught classes in parallel computing, computer architecture, and microprocessors. Current Courses CS 687/487 - Fundamentals of Deep Learning (Spring Semesters) Principles, design and implementation of deep learning systems. Topics include statistical machine learning, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and neural networks, deep neural networks, optimization and learning, convolutional neural networks (CNN), CNN architectures, CNN applications in classification, detection, segmentation, and advanced topics in recurrent networks and generative adversarial networks (GAN). This course requires some basic programming skills and a very strong background in basic math and linear algebra. Enough background on the required mathematical theories and applications will be provided. CS 328 - Fundamentals of Game Design (Fall Semesters) Fundamental topics related to game design. Topics include: game design requirements, game design principles, evaluation, peer review, prototyping. This course requires some basic programming skills and a reasonable background in basic math and linear algebra. Enough background on the required mathematical theories and applications will be provided. Therefore, students should not have major problems understanding the content of the course as long as they follow the book, nd online reading materials. CS 685/485: Computer Vision (Spring 2019) Principles, design and implementation of vision systems. Camera models and image formation, feature detection, segmentation. Camera calibration, 3-D reconstruction, stereo vision. Computer Vision focuses on the development of a theoretic and algorithmic foundation by which useful information about the 3-D world can be automatically extracted and analyzed from a single image or a video sequence of images. Computer Vision systems have many potential applications. Robots who can understand what they see are more likely to interact with the real world in a satisfactory manner Vision methods can be used to track the trajectory of people and vehicles for traffic monitoring; they can help in the identification of faces for security applications; they can be used for obtaining 3-D models from images, with applications in architecture, medicine, virtual reality, or computer-aided design.
