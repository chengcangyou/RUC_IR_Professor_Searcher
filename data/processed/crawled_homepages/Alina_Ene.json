My main research interests are machine learning algorithms, discrete and continuous optimization, approximation algorithms, and differentially private algorithms. Before joining BU, I was an Assistant Professor in the department of Computer Science at the University of Warwick and a postdoc at Princeton University. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from UIUC, where I was very fortunate to be advised by Chandra Chekuri. Prior to that, I was a Computer Science major at Princeton University.
