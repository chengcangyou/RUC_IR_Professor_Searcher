We use theoretical perspectives and research methodologies from the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) research communities to design and implement new technologies, and deploy those technologies to understand their impact. Our research bridges many disciplines such as Health Science, Computer Science, Psychology, and Human Factors Engineering to investigate questions such as: How will artificial intelligence disrupt the healthcare system? And can it help us better manage our personal health? What role can technology play in motivating health and well-being? How do people seek out peer support on social networking platforms like Facebook or Reddit?",
