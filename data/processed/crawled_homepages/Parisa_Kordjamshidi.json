Highlights for the year On Sabbatical for academic year 25-26. Visiting Scholar at Mila Institute of AI , Quebec, Jul-Oct 2025. Visiting Associate Professor UCLA, Samueli Computer Science, Fall 2025. About me Parisa Kordjamshidi is an associate professor of computer science and engineering. She joined Michigan State University on August 2019. Her main research interests are artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, and Neuro-symbolic AI and Reasoning with Multimodla Large Language Models. She is directing the research lab on Heterogeneous Learning and Reasoning (HLR). She has worked on the extraction of formal semantics and structured representations from natural language, with a specific focus on spatial semantics representation. Her notable awards and grants include NSF CAREER award (2019-2024) to work on combining learning and reasoning for spatial language understanding; Office of Naval Research (ONR) grant under the Science of AI program for integration of domain knowledge into statistical learning (DominKnowS project, 2019-2023) and developing a Neuro-Symbolic framework for compositional learning and understanding multiple modalities of vision and language (2023-2027); She obtained Amazon faculty research award (2022), Fulbright scholar (2025) and was in Rising Stars at MIT EECS (2015). Parisa received a PhD from KU Leuven in 2013. She was a post-doc in UIUC in Cognitive Computation Group and was working for KnowEng, Big Data To Knowledge Project. Before joining MSU, she was assistant professor at Tulane university and Research Scientist at Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition during 2016-2019. She is a member of Editorial board of Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR), Action Editor of TACL and a member of Editorial board of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, part of the journal of Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Frontiers in Big Data. She has published, served as either program committee, senior program committee or (senior) area chair in conferences such as ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, COLING, IJCAI, AAAI, and ECAI and organized several international workshops at these venues. She has served as a member of organizing committees of NAACL, ECML-PKDD, EMNLP and AAAI conferences. Research Interests Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models, Neurosymbolic AI for Probabilistic Reasoning, Learning Based Programming, Probabilistic Programming based on LLMs.",
