She is interested in doing data science in the area of journalism, politics, health, and computational social science. The research she does is highly interdisciplinary, which only can be achieved by combining theoretical foundations, computational methods such as NLP and machine learning, and massive computing capability. Previously, she was an Assistant Professor at the School of Information Systems, Singapore Management University. Before SMU, she worked at Qatar Computing Research Institute, HBKU as a scientist. She received her Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge, UK in 2015. For her study, she was funded by EPSRC and she is now an honorable recipient of Google European Scholarship. She is an Associate Editor or EPJ Data Science Journal. She has been a member of the PC of major computer science conferences and computational social science conferences, including ICWSM, TheWeb, ACL, EMNLP, WSDM, AAAI, and IC2S2. She also has been organizing a workshop on News and Public Opinion (NECO) 2016-18, 20. Find out more about our research and recent news at SODA (Social Data and AI) Lab !

Projects Discursive Power in Contemporary Media Systems Contemporary media systems are shaped by diverse constellation of organizations, groups, and individuals contributing information to national and international news flows. In our project, we analyze interdependencies and power relationships among these new constellations. We do so through the concept of discursive power: the ability of contributors to communication spaces to introduce, amplify, and maintain topics, frames, and speakers in interconnected communication spaces. Dynamic creation of nationwide virtual panels for collective behavior prediction The objective of this research is to develop a predictive system that enables stakeholders (e.g. policymakers, politicians, celebrities, and business organizations) to know how people will behave in the future and that provides a solid understanding of these behaviors to help stakeholders' strategic planning. In particular, we will exploit past behaviors to predict future behaviors.
