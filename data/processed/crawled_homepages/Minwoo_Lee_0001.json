I am working on machine learning algorithms for reinforcement learning. My interests focus on various topics in machine learning, with an emphasis on reinforcement learning, such as interpretational learning, transfer learning, continual learning, sparse learning, multiagent learning, fine control based policy development and robust knowledge augmentation. Recent research focuses on the analysis, enhancement, and trustworthiness of learning in diverse human-AI interactions, as well as in generative models and dynamic environments. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Colorado State University in 2017, advised by Chuck Anderson.
