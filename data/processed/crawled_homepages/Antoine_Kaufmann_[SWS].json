I also serve in an adjunct faculty role at the Chair of Distributed Systems and Operating Systems at TU Munich. My research centers on the interplay of software and hardware in post-Moore systems â specialized systems comprising tightly integrated and co-designed hardware and software components. Before joining the tenure-track faculty, I was a research group leader at MPI-SWS for three years. Prior to joining MPI-SWS in August 2018, I obtained my PhD from the Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington. At UW I was part of the systems lab with Tom Anderson, Arvind Krishnamurthy, and Simon Peter (at UT Austin) as my advisors. My research career started at ETH ZÃ¼rich, where I had the opportunity to do research in the Systems Group with Mothy Roscoe during my Bachelor and Master studies.",
