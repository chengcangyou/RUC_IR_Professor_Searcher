I received my PhD in December 2013 from NTUA, Greece, under the supervision of Yannis Avrithis and Stefanos Kollias. From 2014 to 2015, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Inria Rennes, France, working with HervÃ© JÃ©gou. In 2015, I moved to Prague for a postdoc at CTU with OndÅej Chum. My team is currently funded by a 5 years âJunior Starâ starting grant from the Czech science foundation and by two MSCA post-doctoral fellowships. My research focuses on computer vision, particularly on visual representation learning and crafting, as well as large-scale object retrieval and recognition, among other topics. I also care about the responsible use of AI and remain opposed to potential military and surveillance applications. Despite my work with digital images, my heart still belongs to analog photography and the darkroom, where I continue to enjoy working with film. news Sep 01, 2025 I will be attending ICCV 2025.
