I have a long-standing interest in the semantics and logic of names, locality and binding. My aim is to develop mathematical models and methods which aid language design and the development of formal logics for specifying and reasoning about programs. I am particularly interested in higher-order typed programming languages and in dependently typed logics. More details via the pittsposium a picture of whose particpants is here.
