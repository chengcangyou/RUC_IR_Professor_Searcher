Cultivating a flow of pioneering ideas that offer the potential to transform people's lives and the economy using information technology is a motivating force that drives us. Our capacity to rapidly turn these ideas into benefits for partners through collaborative, applied research and innovation makes Southampton a truly exciting place to be.\" Michael is a Professorial Fellow of Information Technology and Director of the IT Innovation Centre within the School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton. He is an Associate Director of the Web Science Institute, Deputy Director of the UKRI Trustworthy Autonomous Systems Hub, co-investigator for the Southampton Biomedical Research Centre Data Health and Society theme, and he leads the Workforce and Health Systems theme at the NIHR Wessex Applied Research Centre. He leads large scale international interdisciplinary research programmes and research hubs at the boundary of technology and society (healthcare, education, creative industries). For example, he is currently the Impact Director for the UKRI Trustworthy Autonomous Systems Hub and previously led EXPERIMEDIA (2011-2015, €10.8M EUR) a multi-venue experimentation service supporting technology innovation through new forms of interaction and experience, FLAME (2017-2020, €6.2M) a large scale real-world (Bristol, Barcelona, London, Sicily) experimental facility for AR/VR services over 5G. More in the biography Research Research groups Member of: Digital Health and Biomedical Engineering Institute for Life Sciences Centre for Health Technologies Interdisciplinary Musculoskeletal Health Web Science Institute IT Innovation Research interests Artifical intelligence for health systems Human centred interactive systems Federated systems management Data governance and risk management Current research His current research focus on advancing data governance and artificial intelligence for health and wellbeing working with legal experts, data governance practitioners, healthcare professionals and the public. He provided strategic leadership for the 2019 Institute for Life Sciences initiative Coalition for Innovation and Digital Health Research (CIDHR) to establish an innovation ecosystem for the progressive digitisation of networked health and social care in collaboration with Hampshire and IoW NHS, NHS Trusts (University Hospital Southampton, Hampshire Hospitals, Portsmouth Hospitals) and Wessex Academic Health Science Network. CIDHR laid the groundwork for the Social Data Foundation exploring new socio-technical models of data governance and contributing to national policy for UKRI Trusted Research Environments and NHS Secure Data Environments. Internationally he is advancing semi-automated privacy risk assessment of cross border exchange of health data for studying rare diseases using federated learning and synthetic data (SYNTHEMA) His AI healthcare programme is tackling challenges across public health, chronic disease management and integrated care. He leads AI research tackling the prevention of (MELD-B) and integrated care (health and social care) for multiple long term conditions (Cluster-AIM Study). He is Principal Investigator for the mySmartCOPD one of the first projects to undertake a national scale clinical trial of AI for self-management of achronic disease, building on a feasibility study conducted as part of the H2020 BigMedilytics project. His rapid insight work “validating home oxygen saturations as a marker of clinical deterioration in patients with suspected COVID-19” supported the NHS through COVID Virtual Wards working with NHS partners across North Hampshire and informing national policies. The South East NHSX RECOxCARE programme that he initiated was scaled by Dr Matt Inada-Kim as the £60 million national COVIDoximetry@home and clinical model adopted by WHO. His AI decision support research for integrated care pathways continued with a focus on the challenge of complex discharge (PROCED) and supporting NHS winter pressures of Acute Respiratory Infections (PHILOSARIP) and Hospital Discharge (DS4SmartDischarge). His research includes a distinct focus on human centred AI and trust/trustworthiness of AI systems. As part of the UKRI Trustworthiness Autonomous System Hub he is laying the Foundations for Trustworthiness Risk Assessment of AI systems, whilst also tackling the challenge of codesigning AI systems with the public, patients and clinicians using computational notebooks as a design tool.
