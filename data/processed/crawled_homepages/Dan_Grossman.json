Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering University of Washington Box 352355 Seattle, WA 98195-2355 djg@cs.washington.edu 206-616-1124 My office is in the spectacular Bill & Melinda Gates Center for Computer Science & Engineering Room 309. The easiest way to find Gates Center 309 (aka CSE2 309) is to take one of the two side-by-side elevators to the third floor, turn left out of the elevator, then turn left again.

Learning to Adapt: Analyses for Configurable Software Luis Vega coadvised with Luis Ceze Programming Abstractions and Efficient Compilation Techniques for Modern FPGAs Benjamin Wood, formerly Wellesley College, coadvised with Luis Ceze Software and Hardware Support for Data-Race Exceptions Bill Zorn, Intel, coadvised with Zach Tatlock Rounding Research My primary research area is programming languages, encompassing theory, implementation, and design. However, I have collaborated broadly, with applications in computer architecture, software engineering, large-scale data processing, and computational fabrication. For specific work, see publications and presentations For projects and news, see the UW PLSE group. Some of my older projects are on other, sometimes outdated-but-preserved-for-posterity group pages: Sampa group, older plse page, even older WASP page.

My Twitter is mostly puns with occasional substance. I joined UW CSE longer ago than 80 of 94 (85%) other current faculty members (reflecting arrivals/departures through Fall 2025). A nice alumni-profile write-up of me from my undergraduate institution, March 2017, unpacks a few of the random events that led to where I am.
