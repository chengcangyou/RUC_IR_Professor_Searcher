I graduated with a PhD in the Security Group (where I still have my old badge), from the Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, under the joint supervision of Prof Ross Anderson and Prof John Daugman. I worked in the security industry for a total of six years before joining Newcastle University Computing Science as a lecturer in December 2010, then a reader in 2014 and a professor in 2018 before moving to my present post. With Peter Ryan, we co-edited a book \"Real-World Electronic Voting: Design, Analysis and Deployment\" (2016, CRC Press, in Amazon). My research interest (and that of my research team) is primarily driven by tackling real-world security problems. With my former PhD advisers (Ross Anderson and John Daugman), I proposed the first solution to combine iris biometrics and cryptography, the two complementary security technologies. Our paper \"Combining crypto with biometrics effectively\" (IEEE Trans. on Computers, 2006) is ranked the top among the Google Scholar Classic Papers in the category of Computer Security & Cryptography. With colleagues, I designed a few cryptographic protocols: AV-net (so far the most efficient solution to the Dining Cryptographers problem), YAK (a PKI-based authenticated key exchange protocol that has stood against all attacks since 2010), J-PAKE (a password authenticated key exchange protocol that has been adopted as a de facto standard for IoT device enrollment, and standardized internationally in ISO/IEC 11770-4), Open Vote network (so far the most efficient decentralized e-voting protocol in terms of rounds, computation and bandwidth), DRE-i (the first E2E verifiable e-voting system without tallying authorities), DRE-ip (an alternative design to DRE-i based on a different real-time computation strategy; see YouTube demo) and SEAL (so far the most efficient decentralised e-auction protocol). So far, none of these protocols have been broken. With Siamak Shahandashti, we found and fixed security weaknesses in SPEKE, a password-authenticated key exchange protocol that has been standardized in IEEE P1363.2 and ISO/IEC 11770-4. The attacks have been acknowledged by ISO/IEC SC 27 Work Group 2 and the standard has been revised in 2017 to incorporate our proposed fix. Some of the protocols that we designed have been applied in practice. In particular, J-PAKE (see blog) has been used in Palemoon sync, NXP Thread (YouTube demo), ARM mbed, OpenThread (YouTube demo), Nest Guard, Nest Detect, Bouncycastle, and adopted by Thread Group (white paper) as an open industry standard for the IoT commissioning process (YouTube tutorial), and standardized internationally in ISO/IEC 11770-4:2017 and in RFC 8236 (together with RFC 8235). An independent study on the security of J-PAKE was presented by Abdalla, Benhamouda and MacKenzie in IEEE S&P 2015 (YouTube presentation). A verifiable classroom voting system based on the DRE-i protocol has been developed and subsequently trialled in real classroom teaching with positive student feedback. The DRE-i protocol represents the first step in exploring a new generation of e-voting protocols that are end-to-end verifiable and also free from any tallying authority. I call this new direction \"Self-Enforcing Electronic Voting\" (SEEV). In 2012, I was awarded a 1.5 million euros ERC starting grant to support my further investigation on SEEV, and in 2015, a follow-up ERC Proof of Concept grant to support commercialization of SEEV (overall, about 4% of the ERC projects have produced a PoC grant). A prototype of the SEEV system (based on DRE-ip) was successfully trialled during the 2019 local elections in Gateshead, UK with positive voter feedback (BBC, University press, CS news). Finally, I have a general interest in designing efficient computing algorithms. I modified the classic Dynamic Programming algorithm to make it more suitable for handwritten signature verification. I worked with John Daugman, the original inventor of iris recognition, and designed a fast search algorithm for iris recognition, which achieves a substantial speed-up over the traditional exhaustive search algorithm with a negligible loss of accuracy. Publications I'm fond of security research that is new, useful and diverse. I am a believer in Roger Needham's maxim: \"Good research comes from tackling real problems\". I love mathematics but I dislike seeing it overused to make papers look hyper-fancy. Feng Hao, Luke Harrison, Saverio Veltri, Irene Pugliatti, Chris Sinclair, Gareth Nixon, \"Experience from UNITA Elections: Reconciling Revote, E2E Verifiability and Low Coercion,\" Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Electronic Voting (E-VOTE-ID) 2025. [PDF] This paper shares our experience of designing, building and deploying a verifiable online voting system for the Student Assembly elections in the UNITA Alliance with the revote capability. Zibo Zhou, Zongyang Zhang, Feng Hao, Bowen Zheng, Zulkanaim Masyhur, \"QV-net: decentralized self-tallying quadratic voting with maximal ballot secrecy,\" the 32nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications System (CCS), 2025. [PDF] This paper presents QV Network (QV-net), a decentralized voting scheme that supports quadratic voting with the maximum protection of ballot secrecy. A voter does not need to trust anyone other than themselves for ballot secrecy. Every observer can tally the election result without learning individual votes.

Mahshid Mehr Nezhad, Feng Hao, Gregory Epiphaniou, Carsten Maple, Timur Yunusov, \"SoK: Security of EMV Contactless Payment Systems,\" IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroS&P), 2025. [PDF] This paper presents a systemization of knowledge (SoK) on the security of EMV contactless payment systems. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the vulnerabilities in EMV contactless payment with focus on open-loop systems such as Visa and Mastercard, a taxonomy of attacks and an empirical replication of the reported attacks to assess their practical feasibility. Muyao Qiu, Jinguang Han, Feng Hao, Chao Sun, and Ge Wu, \"Privacy-Preserving and Traceable Functional Encryption for Inner Product In Cloud Computing\", IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing, 2025 [PDF] This paper presents a functional encryption scheme to compute the inner product of two vectors with the additional privacy-preserving and traceable features.

It extends the conference paper in three main aspects. First, we add support for ranking candidates with indifference, while the earlier work only allows strict preference. Second, for the choice of ranking with strict preference, we introduce a new technique to securely use only half of the matrix instead of a full matrix to record votes, thus reducing the computation by half. Third, we provide an updated open-source implementation that supports not only strict preference but also indifference.

Luke Harrison, Samiran Bag, Feng Hao, \"Camel: E2E Verifiable Instant Runoff Voting without Tallying Authorities,\" ACM ASIA Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ASIACCS), 2024 [PDF] This paper presents Camel, an end-to-end verifiable instant runoff voting (IRV) protocol without tallying authorities. We name the protocol \"Camel\" as Camels have multiple chambers in their stomach, which enables the processing of food in stages with the maximum extraction of nutrients and the minimum loss of water. This resembles how our protocol processes the encryption of votes in multiple stages.

Today, SRP-6a is the only widely deployed augmented PAKE scheme in the real world (e.g., used in Apple's iCloud). We show that Owl has systematic advantages over SRP-6a in terms of security, efficiency and crypto agility. Owl also",
