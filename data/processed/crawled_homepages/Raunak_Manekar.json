I work at the intersection of computer vision, generative AI and computational imaging. I'm passionate about developing learning-based solutions for visual inverse problems in vairous fields of science and engineering. Previously, I have been a Sr. AI Scientist at GE Healthcare (Bengaluru) were I worked on medical imaging (MRI) technologies. I received my PhD from University of Minnesota, TC working with Prof. Jaideep Srivastava on generative AI for scientific imaging. After which I worked as postdoctoral researcher at UCLA (Coherent Imaging Group) with Prof. John Miao. Note: We are looking for highly motivated students to join our lab to work on various problems related to computer vision, imaging, and LLMs over Summer and Fall 2025. Interested candidates can email me directly with their CV. News April 2025: [upcoming] Presenting an SPS journal paper at ICASSP 2025 in Hyderabad. March 2025: Thrilled to start as Asst.
