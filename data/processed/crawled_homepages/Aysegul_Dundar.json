Previously, I was a senior research scientist at NVIDIA, Santa Clara, USA. I received my Ph.D. degree at Purdue University, under the supervision of Professor Eugenio Culurciello, in 2016. My research was focused on embedded vision systems and was featured in popular technology journals such as MIT Technology Review and BBC. I received a B.Sc. degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Bogazici University in Turkey, in 2011. My current research focuses on deep learning algorithms for computer vision. I lead the Generative Deep Learning Research Lab at Bilkent University. Please visit the web-page. Prospective students, please see this page.
