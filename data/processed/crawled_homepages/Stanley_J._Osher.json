Awarded the SIAM Kleinman Prize for his many contributions to the analysis and computation of hyperbolic equations and their applications in science and engineering, and for his mentoring of young scientists and service to the scientific community. His many innovations in numerical schemes for conservation laws and Hamilton-Jacobi equations and in the development of the level set method and its applications have had enormous impact across disciplinary boundaries in image processing, control, flow simulation, and many other fields.
