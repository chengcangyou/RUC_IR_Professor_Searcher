Rabi Award View news Close Victor Han (advisor: Prof. Chunlei Liu) was selected as a finalist for the International Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM) I.I. Rabi Young Investigator Award for original basic research.  He was chosen for his paper entitled âMultiphoton Magnetic Resonance Imaging,â in which he developed a novel technique that excites multiphoton resonances to generate signal for MRI by using multiple magnetic field frequencies, none of which is near the Larmor frequency. Only the total energy absorbed by a spin must correspond to the Larmor frequency. In contrast, todayâs MRI exclusively relies on single-photon excitation. He was named runner-up at the ISMRM annual conference in early August.  Han will continue to develop his multiphoton technique and is exploring its applications in medicine and neuroscience as a part of his PhD dissertation research.  The ISMRM is a multi-disciplinary nonprofit professional association that promotes innovation, development, and application of magnetic resonance techniques in medicine and biology throughout the world.

Congratulations! Year: 2020 Lipid Oxidation Induced by RF Waves and Mediated by Ferritin Iron Causes Activation of Ferritin-Tagged Ion Channels Miriam HernÃ¡ndez-Morales et al. Cell Reports 2020 Lipid Oxidation Induced by RF Waves and Mediated by Ferritin Iron Causes Activation of Ferritin-Tagged Ion Channels View full paper Close One approach to magnetogenetics uses radiofrequency (RF) waves to activate transient receptor potential channels (TRPV1 and TRPV4) that are coupled to cellular ferritins. The mechanisms underlying this effect are unclear and controversial. Theoretical calculations suggest that the heat produced by RF fields is likely orders of magnitude weaker than needed for channel activation. Using the FeRIC (Ferritin iron Redistribution to Ion Channels) system, we have uncovered a mechanism of activation of ferritin-tagged channels via a biochemical pathway initiated by RF disturbance of ferritin and mediated by ferritin-associated iron. We show that, in cells expressing TRPVFeRIC channels, RF increases the levels of the labile iron pool in a ferritin-dependent manner. Free iron participates in chemical reactions, producing reactive oxygen species and oxidized lipids that ultimately activate the TRPVFeRIC channels. This biochemical pathway predicts a similar RF-induced activation of other lipid-sensitive TRP channels and may guide future magnetogenetic designs.

Journal of Neurosurgery, 2019 Precise targeting of the globus pallidus internus with quantitative susceptibility mapping for deep brain stimulation surgery View full paper Close OBJECTIVE The goal of this study was to demonstrate the use of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM)âbased images to precisely localize the globus pallidus internus (GPi) for deep brain stimulation (DBS) planning and to enhance postsurgical visualization of the DBS lead positions. METHODS Presurgical T1-weighted (T1w), T2-weighted (T2w), and QSM images as well as postsurgical CT images were obtained in 29 patients with Parkinsonâs disease. To enhance the contrast within the GP, a hybrid contrast was created by linearly combining T1w and QSM images. Contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) of the GPi on T1w, T2w, QSM, and hybrid images were compared. The CNR differences were tested using the 1-way ANOVA method. The visualization of the DBS lead position was demonstrated by merging the postsurgical CT with presurgical MR images. RESULTS The hybrid images yield the best CNRs for GPi depiction and the visualization of the postsurgical DBS lead position was significantly improved. CONCLUSIONS QSM-based images allow for confident localization of borders of the GPi that is superior to T1w and T2w images. High-contrast hybrid images can be used for precisely directed DBS targeting, e.g., GPi DBS for the treatment of advanced Parkinsonâs disease.

Year: 2019 Temperature-activated ion channels in neural crest cells confer maternal feverâassociated birth defects Mary R. Hutson et al. Science Signaling 2017 Temperature-activated ion channels in neural crest cells confer maternal feverâassociated birth defects View full paper Close Birth defects of the heart and face are common, and most have no known genetic cause, suggesting a role for environmental factors. Maternal fever during the first trimester is an environmental risk factor linked to these defects. Neural crest cells are precursor populations essential to the development of both at-risk tissues. We report that two heat-activated transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels, TRPV1 and TRPV4, were present in neural crest cells during critical windows of heart and face development. TRPV1 antagonists protected against the development of hyperthermia-induced defects in chick embryos. Treatment with chemical agonists of TRPV1 or TRPV4 replicated hyperthermia-induced birth defects in chick and zebrafish embryos. To test whether transient TRPV channel permeability in neural crest cells was sufficient to induce these defects, we engineered iron-binding modifications to TRPV1 and TRPV4 that enabled remote and noninvasive activation of these channels in specific cellular locations and at specific developmental times in chick embryos with radio-frequency electromagnetic fields. Transient stimulation of radio frequencyâcontrolled TRP channels in neural crest cells replicated fever-associated defects in developing chick embryos. Our data provide a previously undescribed mechanism for congenital defects, whereby hyperthermia activates ion channels that negatively affect fetal development. Authors: Mary R. Hutson1,*, Anna L.

Methods Players underwent diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) scans. Head impact data was recorded. Association between parametric changes and frequency of frontal head impact was assessed. Results In deep gray matter, significant decreases in mean kurtosis (MK) and increases in mean diffusivity (MD) over the season were observed in the thalamus and putamen. Correlations between changes in DKI metrics and frequency of frontal impacts were observed in the putamen and caudate. In cortical gray matter, decreases in MK were observed in regions including the pars triangularis and inferior parietal. In addition, increases in MD were observed in the rostral middle frontal cortices. Negative correlations between MK and frequency of frontal impacts were observed in the posterior part of the brain including the pericalcarine, lingual and middle temporal cortices. Magnetic susceptibility values exhibited no significant difference or correlation, suggesting these diffusion changes common within the group may not be associated with iron-related mechanisms. Implications for patient care DKI may yield valuable biomarkers for evaluating the severity of brain injuries associated with subconcussive head impacts in contact sport athletes.
