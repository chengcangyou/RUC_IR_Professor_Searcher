Alves Redol 9, 1000-029 Lisbon, Portugal Short Bio & Research I am an Assistant Professor at Técnico (University of Lisbon), and a Senior Researcher INESC-ID Lisbon. Before, I was a Senior Researcher at Oracle Labs Zurich (working on GraalVM), and before that, I was a Post-doc Researcher in the Systems Group, ETH Zurich, which I joined after receiving my PhD in CS from Técnico (University of Lisbon). Most of my research focuses in the intersection between Systems and Programming Languages. I am especially interested in optimizing language runtimes for cloud environments such as Microservices and Serverless. Besides language runtimes, I work on Operating Systems, and Parallel and Distributed Systems.
