Grochow Associate Professor Departments of Computer Science and Mathematics University of Colorado at Boulder [first initial][last name]@colorado.edu I will not be in the office during the coronavirus pandemic. My virtual office is here on Zoom.

My research has two main thrusts (with deep underlying relations beneath): Interactions between theoretical computer science and mathematics (particularly algebraic geometry, representation theory, and group theory), and Developing the theory of complex systems and complex networks, and applying this theory with my collaborators in a variety of fields, such as ecology, evolutionary biology, economics, climate, and beyond. I'm always looking for new problems that need new theory! For a taste of the deep underlying relations, check out this brief video. I was previously an Omidyar Fellow at the interdisciplinary Santa Fe Institute for complex systems. Prior to SFI, I was a postdoc in the University of Toronto CS Theory Group, and prior to that I got my Ph.D. at the University of Chicago. What's new (Nov 5, 2024) New preprint posted and accepted to ITCS '25: Finite matrix multiplication algorithms from infinite groups, joint with Jonah Blasiak, Henry Cohn, Kevin Pratt, and Chris Umans.
