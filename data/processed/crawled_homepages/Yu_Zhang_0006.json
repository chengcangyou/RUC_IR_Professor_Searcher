Prior to joining Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), I have worked in HKUST and Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) for about eight years. My current research interests include artificial intelligence, machine learning, pattern recognition, and data mining. I am especially interested in multi-task learning, transfer learning, meta learning, deep learning, and semi-supervised learning. Books Qiang Yang, Yu Zhang, Wenyuan Dai, and Sinno Jialin Pan.
