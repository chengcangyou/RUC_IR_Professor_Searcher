Changes in weather patterns, oceans, sea level rise, and disaster risk amplify the need for accelerated AI research in the environmental sciences. AI2ES is a convergent, multi-sector NSF Trustworthy AI institute led by the University of Oklahoma that brings together researchers in AI, atmospheric science, ocean science, and risk communication to create novel trustworthy AI techniques that improve our ability to understand, predict, and communicate high-impact weather. Research My research focuses on developing and applying artificial intelligence and machine learning methods for real-world applications with a special interest in high-impact weather. Much of my current work focuses on AI2ES. To create a top science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce, we need a diverse and flexible workforce. Diversity will bring new ideas to the forefront and flexibility is required when technology changes rapidly. My research lab is the Interaction, Discovery, Exploration and Adaptation (IDEA) lab. Education Ph.D. in Computer Science (May 2002), University of Massachusetts Amherst. M.S. in Computer Science (1998), University of Massachusetts Amherst B.S. (Honors) in Math and Computer Science (minor: Spanish, 1996), Carnegie Mellon University",
