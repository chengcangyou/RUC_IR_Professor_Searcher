Publications Symbolic MRD: Dynamic Memory, Undefined Behaviour, and Extrinsic Choice We present the first thin-air free memory model that admits compiler optimisations that aggressively leverage knowledge from alias analysis, an assumption of freedom from undefined behaviour, and from the extrinsic choices of real implementations such as over-alignment. Our model has tooling support with state-of-the-art performance, executing a battery of tests orders of magnitude quicker than other executable thin-air free semantics. The model integrates with the C/C++ memory model through an exportable semantic dependency relation, it allows standard compilation mappings for atomics, and it matches all tests in the recently published desiderata for C/C++ from the ISO.

Rust is a systems language that provides memory safety through a combination of a static checks embodied in the type system and ad hoc dynamic checks inserted where this analysis becomes impractical. The Morello prototype architecture from ARM uses capabilities, fat pointers augmented with object bounds information, to catch failures of memory safety. This paper presents a compiler from Rust to the Morello architecture, together with a comparison of the performance of Rust’s runtime safety checks and the hardware-supported checks of Morello.

This gives well-defined semantics to programs with both, for example, constant loads and generic stores to the same address. The memory model extension was built in the relational model checking tool, Alloy, and we showed that our extension to the PTX model is sound and complete with respect to the existing industrial model.

It captures program dependencies by embedding a logic into predicate transformers which compose to create proof burdens necessary to remove dependencies which are syntactic only from list of dependencies actually present in a program. I developed an OCaml tool to automatically evaluate PwT over a series of litmus tests. Appears in the proceedings of POPL 2022.

As well as helping to define the denotation, I built an evaluation tool (MRDer) in OCaml to enable fast calculation of the semantics against a corpus of litmus tests. Further, I proved meta-theoretic properties about the semantics with respect to industry standard models of C/C++. P2850: Minimal compiler preserved dependencies. ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG21.

We use cutting edge Quantified Boolean Formulae (QBF) solvers to efficiently simulate a new class of memory model which solve the thin-air problem. We encode the problems in a high-level second order logic giving us flexibility in problem expression. This then gets translated into a QBF model checking problem for a solver to efficiently execute.
