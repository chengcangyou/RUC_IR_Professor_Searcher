I received my PhD from UC San Diego in 2009 and my BS from UC Berkeley in 2002. I co-lead the networked systems lab and recently spun out INVISV. I have very broad interests and my projects frequently span multiple areas of CS and other disciplines. Currently I have active projects in security/privacy, networked systems, agriculture, and fire mitigation.
