I organise a weekly seminar at Rutgers around these topics. Here are copies of all of my articles, and here are some lecture notes from courses past. A few papers representative of my interests are listed below. Selected papers Elementary symmetric polynomials under the fixed point measure [PDF]. Submitted, with A. Khaitan and I. Mata. Antichain codes [PDF]. Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society, 55 (2023), with B. Gunby, X. He and S. Spiro. Friendly bisections of random graphs [PDF]. Communications of the American Mathematical Society, 2 (2022), with A. Ferber, M. Kwan, A. Sah and M. Sawhney. Subgraphs of large connectivity and chromatic number [PDF]. Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society, 54 (2022), with A. GirÃ£o. Spanning surfaces in 3-graphs [PDF]. Journal of the European Mathematical Society, 24 (2022), with A. Georgakopoulos, J. Haslegrave and R. Montgomery. Thresholds versus fractional expectation-thresholds [PDF]. Annals of Mathematics, 194 (2021), with K. Frankston, J. Kahn and J. Park. Disproportionate division [PDF]. Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society, 52 (2020), with L. Crew and S. Spirkl. Coalescence on the real line [PDF]. Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, 371 (2019), with P.
