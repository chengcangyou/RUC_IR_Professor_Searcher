I chaired the AI@HPI Conference 2024 featuring renowned speakers from academia, industry, politics, and policy. Congratulations to Rohan Sawahn for winning the Better World Award 2024 for his master thesis on efficient on-device deep learning methods to support SearchWing's maritime refugee rescue efforts in the Mediterranean Sea, with additional mentorship by Maximilian Schall. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was given a presentation about our gorilla conservation AI project. Thanks to Maximilian Schall for leading this effort and giving the talk. Congratulations to Tolga Buz, Moritz Schneider et al. for our First Runner-Up Paper Award at the ACM WebSci 2024 conference, for our work on WallStreetBets! Our collaboration with Zoo Berlin on gorilla conservation AI was covered widely in the press. The goal is to deploy this in the Congo rainforest along with our partners Sabine Plattner African Charities (thanks to Magdalena Bermejo) and Conservation X Labs (thanks to Dante Wasmuth). Congratulations to Maximilian Schall et al. for our IEEE TCSE Distinguished Paper Award at the SANER 2024 conference, for our work on CommitBench! Congratulations to Johannes Hagemann et al. for our Best Paper Award at the NeurIPS 2023 Workshop on Advancing Neural Network Training! Funding for the new AI Service Center Berlin-Brandenburg from BMBF/BMFTR, which is creating AI cloud and service infrastructure. Best Paper Award at the highly selective IR conference CIKM 2022 for the paper D-HYPR: Harnessing Neighborhood Modeling and Asymmetry Preservation for Digraph Representation Learning with first author Honglu Zhou and other collaborators. The paper presents a new approach and benchmark for directed graph neural networks! Our paper WallStreetBets Beyond GameStop, YOLOs, and the Moon: The Unique Traits of Redditâs Finance Communities was selected among the Best AMCIS 2022 Top 25% Complete Papers. The first author Pratik Agrawal also wrote a blog post summarizing some highlights of AMCIS 2022. New Book \"Knowledge Graphs\" published by Morgan & Claypool (Amazon) and also free to read online. Envision Bootcamp: A Hands-on Introduction to Multimodal (Signal) Analysis Techniques To gain Qualitative and Quantitative Understanding of Team Dynamics, Potsdam + online, 8 â 10 December 2021. Congratulations to Sedigheh (Sarah) Eslami for the 3rd place in the ImageCLEF VQA-Med 2021 challenge on Medical Visual Question Answering! Our paper is now available. We have received funding for a new center called Mittelstand-Digital Zentrum Berlin, which is going to help small and medium-sized enterprises adopt AI and IT. At the EACL 2021 LANTERN Workshop, the Best Paper Award (sponsored by Hugging Face) was awarded to our paper \"Exploiting ImageâText Synergy for Contextual Image Captioning\" (Dataset/Code) Very humbled to receive the Rutgers CSGSS Best Professor Award, along with Yongfeng Zhang, in the Teaching, Advising, and Overall categories. At this point, I am not really sure I deserve this award, but I will consider this an additional reason to work hard and live up to the award in the future. Congratulations to Tugba Kulahcioglu for her Nomination for Best Paper at the 12th IEEE International Conference on Semantic Computing, Laguna Hills, CA, 2018. Congratulations to Xiang Long for winning the ActivityNet 2017 Kinetics challenge! Find out more about the details of the approach in our CVPR paper. Congratulations to Xiang Long for winning the 3rd Prize ($20,000) in the Google Cloud & YouTube-8M Video Understanding Challenge! Find out more about the details of the approach in our AAAI 2018 paper. Our deep neural information retrieval model PACRR was the backbone for the top-ranked TREC 2017 Complex Answer Retrieval submissions! Congratulations to Qian Yang for receiving a Google Women Techmakers Scholarship! Dear Students: Please contact me if you are interested in research projects related to AI, especially large language models, natural language processing, or machine learning! Curriculum Vitae From 2017 to 2020, I was an Assistant Professor heading the Deep Data Lab at Rutgers University, NJ, USA, which is among the Top 40 universities in the US, located in the Greater New York metroplitan area. From 2013 to 2016, I was an Assistant Professor heading the Web Mining and Language Technology group at Tsinghua University, which is generally considered mainland China's #1 Science & Engineering university, and ranks 1st in the world in the U.S. News & World Report Computer Science ranking (2020), 8th in the world on CSRankings.org (as of 2020-06), 10th in the world in the Times Higher Education World University Reputation Ranking 2021, and 15th in the world in the QS World University Ranking (2021). This was as part of the Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, which is led by Turing award winner Andrew Yao and conducts interdisciplinary computer science and quantum computing research. Before that, I spent two years as a post-doctoral research scholar at UC Berkeley working in the AI/FrameNet group at the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI). I also spent 4 months at the Machine Learning and Perception Group (headed by Christopher Bishop) at Microsoft Research Cambridge, working with Thore Graepel and Gjergji Kasneci. Prior to that, I was a member of the Databases and Information Systems Group headed by Gerhard Weikum at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics, receiving my doctoral degree from Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany in 2010. Team and Research Foci I am leading the AI and Intelligent Systems group at HPI, which currently consists of 20+ staff members plus various master's and bachelor's students. We conduct interdisciplinary research in computer science and beyond. The vision driving this research is the idea that there is now so much digital data out there that machines ought to be able to learn to guide us in almost every aspect of our daily life, e.g. by addressing our information needs and helping us make more informed decisions. This, however, requires novel algorithms that simultaneously learn and integrate information from multiple heterogeneous data sources in order to make sense of human language and more generally of the world. More specifically, my research interests include: AI and Machine Learning, especially for Large Language Models and Natural Language Processing Cross-modal AI, e.g. incorporating knowledge graphs, vision-language models Societal and philosophical aspects of AI Join us! Get in touch with me if you are seeking PhD or Post-Doc opportunities at one of the top universities for computer science in Germany, located in the attractive and very international Berlin area.
