His expertise lies in using Action Research and Participatory methods (e.g. co-design) to design, develop and deploy web/mobile applications for community engagement and collective action, leveraging community lived experience. Delvin has worked on public health and community development projects with government bodies, e.g., the Department of Families, Fairness & Housing (DFFH Victoria), international not-for-profits (IFRC, Oxfam, Caritas) and local multicultural community organisations in Victoria, Australia. He has conducted fieldwork and worked on projects in countries across Asia, Africa, South America, Europe and Australia. Configured for “real-world impact”, this work has been recognised at both national and international levels. His work on creating a youth social media playbook for Victorian multicultural organisations was cited in Victorian Government’s Better Practice Guide to Multicultural Communications. Limitless (a global youth-first innovation campaign in partnership with Solferino Academy, IFRC, led by A/Prof Tom Bartindale which engaged 8000+ global youth volunteers) won Silver in the Global Good Awards. Delvin’s PhD research at Newcastle University, UK (Digital Media & Community Voice Designing for Community Participation in Training and Monitoring & Evaluation) resulted in the creation of the Indaba toolkit (https://indaba.dev) for community media, a groundbreaking process for community-led, mobile video creation within international development work. Indaba is now part of the M&E toolkit of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and the 192 countries in which they operate.Monash teaching commitmentFIT2081 - Mobile Application Development (UG unit, 1000+ students) FIT5032 - Internet Applications Development (PG unit, 300+ students) Previous Roles FIT5136 - Software Engineering (Lecturer) FIT5125 - Research Methods in Information Technology (Content development) FIT2095 - Full-stack Web DevelopmentConsultingDelvin carries out consulting and pro-bono work for organisations interested in gathering community voice and conducting sensemaking in Australia and overseas.
