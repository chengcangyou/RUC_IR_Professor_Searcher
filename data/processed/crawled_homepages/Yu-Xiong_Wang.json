I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). My research lies in computer vision, machine learning, and robotics, with a specific focus on open-world perception, meta-learning, multi-modal learning, generative modeling, and agent learning. Before joining Illinois CS, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof. Martial Hebert. I obtained my Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. Martial Hebert in the Robotics Institute. I have also been closely working with Prof. Deva Ramanan and Prof. Ruslan Salakhutdinov. I receive the Best Paper Honorable Mention Award for streaming perception in ECCV 2020, and Best Paper Award Finalist in CVPR 2019, 2022. I am recognized as a Notable Area Chair in ICLR 2023, and an Expert Reviewer in TMLR. I am selected to participate in the National Academy of Engineeringâs (NAE) Frontiers of Engineering symposium. Please feel free to contact me if interested! I am always seeking self-motivated Ph.D., M.S., and undergraduate students.Â Our group also has openings for visiting students. Current Research Topics Meta-learning and learning to learn Open-world, multi-modal, few-shot, and self-supervised learning 3D vision Generative modeling, predictive learning Human motion and human-object interaction modeling Reinforcement learning, robot/agent learning In-the-wild applications in robotics, autonomous driving, agriculture, materials science, chemistry, healthcare, etc. Dissertation Learning to Learn for Small Sample Visual Recognition Thesis Committee: Martial Hebert, Deva Ramanan, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Andrew Zisserman, Yann LeCun Talks One of our primary research efforts focuses on bridging generative and discriminative learning, facilitating autonomous agents to perceive, interact, and act in the open world. For representative works, please refer to my two recent talks: the first talk, presented at the C3.ai Generative AI Workshop, elaborates on how we ground generative modeling in 3D and 4D; the second talk, given at the London Machine Learning Meetup, explores various techniques that leverage LLMs and generative visual models for perception and decision-making.
