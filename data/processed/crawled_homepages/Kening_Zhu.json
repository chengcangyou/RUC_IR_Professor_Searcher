My research interest lies in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), especially Multimodal and Embodied Interaction (MEI). ​ I established the MEI lab in 2017. We are particularly working on - mobile gesture interaction, - tangible/wearable user interfaces, - multimodal and embodied VR/AR, - interactive digital fabrication and rapid prototyping. I got my PhD degree in National University of Singapore under the supervision of Professor Ryohei Nakatsu and Dr. Shengdong Zhao, and my Bachelor degree on Computer Science in Huazhong University of Science and Technology. ​ I am looking forward to work with interesting and crazy scientists. I am currently looking for PhD students, Research Assistants (RAs). If you are highly motivated and interested in human computer interaction, please contact me. ﻿ Kening Zhu (Ken) ​ ​​CityU HK Scholar Page CityU HK Profile Page​bottom of page",
