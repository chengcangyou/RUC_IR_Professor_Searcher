Topics of interest include manipulation of trust ratings, formalisation of trust and reputation, use of fake accounts (bots) and attacks on trust and reputation systems. The methodologies used are formal methods, probability theory and information theory. Most findings come in the form of theorems and simulations, where a powerful adversary is assumed. This allows us to conclude whether a certain approach is secure or vulnerable to certain attacks. Browser does not support script. Browser does not support script.
