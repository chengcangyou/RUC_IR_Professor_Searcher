Prior to joining IIT Bombay, I was a postdoc at HDSI, UCSD. I obtained a PhD in ECE and MS in Statistics both from UCLA, and a B.Tech + M.Tech dual degree in EE from IIT Bombay. My current research focusses on understanding the generalization behaviour of interpolating machine learning models such as neural networks. I also develop fast and scalable algorithms for training kernel machines. Students interested in working with me please read this note.
