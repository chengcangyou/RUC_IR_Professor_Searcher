Bio and Research Information GianMario Besana is a Professor in the College of Computing and Digital Media and currently serves as Associate Provost for Global Engagement and Online Learning at DePaul University in Chicago. His portfolio comprises the internationalization process of the institution and the online learning operations. Under his guidance, DePaul’s faculty training program for online teaching was recognized in 2012 with the Sloan-C award for best faculty development program for online teaching in the United States. The two sides of his portfolio recently came together in the creation of the Global Learning Experience program, an initiative aimed at supporting DePaul’s faculty members who wish to open their classrooms to technology facilitated learning experiences at a distance, in collaboration with international partners. Dr. Besana earned his Ph.D. in Mathematics at the University of Notre Dame, IN, after completing his bachelor degree, also in Mathematics, at the Universita’ degli Studi di Milano, Italy. He has published widely in the field of algebraic geometry, applications to computer vision, and computer science education.
