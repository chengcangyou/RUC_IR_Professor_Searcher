Profile Research Teaching and supervision Publications Grants and funding Contact Profile Research Teaching and supervision Publications Grants and funding Contact Profile Biography I received my MSc degree in Bioinformatics from the University of Tübingen, Germany in 2006 and my PhD in Computer Science from the same institution in 2011. From 2002 to 2006 as a student and from 2006 to 2012 I worked in the group of Prof. Niels Birbaumer in particular on brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for communication with persons with severe motor impairments. During this time I worked on the online processing of electroencephalography (EEG) data, the design of new communication paradigms and the analysis of electrocorticography (ECoG) and functional magnetic resonance data (fMRI) with a focus on clinical applications. Since then I have held positions at the University of Würzburg in Germany (Prof. Dr. Andrea Kübler), the National Rehabilitation Center for Persons with Disabilities in Japan (Prof. Dr. Kenji Kansaku) and the University of Oslo in Norway (Prof. Dr. Johan F. Storm). My research interests include auditory BCIs for communication, the neural mechanisms of learning with BCIs, the neural signature of pain and disorders of consciousness. Currently I am a Senior Lecturer in Brain-Computer Interfacing at the University of Essex, UK.
