NYU Tandon, helming a research team that includes Stanford University and the City University of New York, just received funding from a $3.8 million grant from the National Science Foundation to build the missing infrastructure that could make those technologies practical, via a new design platform and library that allows researchers to develop and share chip designs. The problem is stark. Running a simple AI model on encrypted data takes over 10 minutes instead of milliseconds, a four order of magnitude performance gap that impedes many real-world use cases. Current approaches to speeding up cryptographic computing have hit a wall, however. \"The normal tricks that we have to get over this performance bottleneck won’t scale much further, so we have to do something different,\" said Brandon Reagen, the project's lead investigator. Reagen is an NYU Tandon assistant professor with appointments in the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Department and in the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) Department. He is also on the faculty of NYU's Center for Advanced Technology in Telecommunications (CATT) and the NYU Center for Cybersecurity (CCS). The team's solution is a new platform called \"Cryptolets.” Currently, researchers working on privacy chips must build everything from scratch. Cryptolets will provide three things: a library where researchers can share and access pre-built, optimized hardware designs for privacy computing; tools that allow multiple smaller chips to work together as one powerful system; and automated testing to ensure contributed designs work correctly and securely. This chiplet approach — using multiple small, specialized chips working together — is a departure from traditional single, monolithic chip optimization, potentially breaking through performance barriers. For Reagen, this project represents the next stage of his research approach. \"For years, most of our academic research has been working in simulation and modeling,\" he said. \"I want to pivot to building. I’d like to see real-world encrypted data run through machine learning workloads in the cloud without the cloud ever seeing your data. You could, for example, prove you are who you say you are without actually revealing your driver's license, social security number, or birth certificate.\" What sets this project apart is its community-building approach. The researchers are creating competitions where students and other researchers use Cryptolets to compete in designing the best chip components. The project plans to organize annual challenges at major cybersecurity and computer architecture conferences. The first workshop will take place in October 2025 at MICRO 2025, which focuses on hardware for zero-knowledge proofs. \"We want to build a community, too, so everyone's not working in their own silos,\" Reagen said. The project will support fabrication opportunities for competition winners, with plans to assist tapeouts of smaller designs initially and larger full-system tapeouts in the later phases, helping participants who lack chip fabrication resources at their home institutions \"With Cryptolets, we are not just funding a new hardware platform—we are enabling a community-wide leap in how privacy-preserving computation can move from theory to practice,” said Deep Medhi, program director in the Computer & Information Sciences & Engineering Directorate at the U.S. National Science Foundation. “By lowering barriers for researchers and students to design, share and test cryptographic chips, this project aligns with NSF’s mission to advance secure, trustworthy and accessible technologies that benefit society at large.\" If the project succeeds, it could enable a future where strong digital privacy isn't just theoretically possible, but practically deployable at scale, from protecting personal health data to securing financial transactions to enabling private AI assistants that never see people's actual queries. Along with Reagen, the team is led by NYU Tandon co-investigators Ramesh Karri, ECE Professor and Department Chair, and faculty member of CATT and CCS; Siddharth Garg, Professor in ECE and faculty member of NYU WIRELESS and CCS; Austin Rovinski, Assistant Professor in ECE; The City College of New York’s Rosario Gennaro and Tushar Jois; and Stanford's Thierry Tambe and Caroline Trippel, with Warren Savage serving as project manager. The team also includes industry advisors from companies working on cryptographic technologies. September 29, 2025 NYU Tandon engineers create first AI model specialized for chip design language, earning top journal honor Researchers at NYU Tandon School of Engineering have created VeriGen, the first specialized artificial intelligence model successfully trained to generate Verilog code, the programming language that describes how a chip's circuitry functions. The research just earned the ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems 2024 Best Paper Award, affirming it as a major advance in automating the creation of hardware description languages that have traditionally required deep technical expertise. \"General purpose AI models are not very good at generating Verilog code, because there's very little Verilog code on the Internet available for training,\" said lead author Institute Professor Siddharth Garg, who sits in NYU Tandon’s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and serves on the faculty of NYU WIRELESS and NYU Center for Cybersecurity (CCS). \"These models tend to do well on programming languages that are well represented on GitHub, like C and Python, but tend to do a lot worse on poorly represented languages like Verilog.\" Along with Garg, a team of NYU Tandon Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty members Ramesh Karri and Brendan Dolan-Gavitt tackled this challenge by creating and distributing the largest AI training dataset of Verilog code ever assembled. They scoured GitHub to gather approximately 50,000 Verilog files from public repositories, and supplemented this with content from 70 Verilog textbooks. This data collection process required careful filtering and de-duplication to create a high-quality training corpus. For their most powerful model, the researchers then fine-tuned Salesforce's open-source CodeGen-16B language model, which contains 16 billion parameters and was originally pre-trained on both natural language and programming code. The computational demands were substantial. Training required three NVIDIA A100 GPUs working in parallel, with the model parameters alone consuming 30 GB of memory and the full training process requiring approximately 250 GB of GPU memory. This fine-tuned model performed impressively in testing, outperforming commercial state-of-the-art models while being an order of magnitude smaller and fully open-source. In their evaluation, the fine-tuned ",
