Research My research area is operating systems/distributed systems. My research has focused on cloud infrastructure services and federation (e.g., ExoGENI), trust management and security in cloud environments (e.g., Silver), energy-aware computing, and automation for cloud-hosted applications (e.g., ADAMANT). My group has also conducted research on network storage, software-defined and end-system networking, and Internet service infrastructures. These summaries here are historical and somewhat out of date, but someday maybe I will fix it. My Duke Scholars page is more current. These days I am mostly interested in integrity and trust: where it comes from, how we represent it, how we reason about it in software, and how we build software systems that are worthy of our trust.
