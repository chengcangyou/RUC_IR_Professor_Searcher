Maunder & Lajos Hanzo, 2023, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 1 - 15 DOI: 10.1109/TVT.2023.3312029 Type: article Biography Prof Robert G. Maunder has studied with the School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, UK, since October 2000. He was awarded a first class honours BEng in Electronic Engineering in July 2003, as well as a PhD in Telecommunications in December 2007. He began a lectureship in November 2007 and was promoted to Associate Professor in March 2013 and to Professor in August 2017. He was awarded Senior Member status of the IEEE in December 2012, Chartered Engineer status of the IET in November 2013 and Fellow status of the IET in January 2017. Rob's research interests include joint source/channel coding and the holistic design of algorithms and hardware implementations for wireless communications. He has published a number of IEEE papers in these areas. He is the founder and CTO of AccelerComm Ltd, which is commercialising his research as soft-IP.
