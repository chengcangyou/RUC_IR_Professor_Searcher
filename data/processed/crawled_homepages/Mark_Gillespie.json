I'm looking for students to join my groupâif you're excited about graphics and geometry processing and plan on applying to PhD programs this fall, please reach out! I am currently a postdoc in computer science at Ãcole Polytechnique, working with Mathieu Desbrun. I design algorithms for reliably and efficiently processing geometric data, drawing inspiration from topology and differential geometry. I received my PhD from Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by Keenan Crane. Before that, I was an undergraduate at Caltech, where I worked on plasma simulation with Peter SchrÃ¶der, chromosomal shape embeddings with Mathieu Desbrun, and interval analysis root finding techniques with Alan Barr. In my spare time, I like to design origami models and knit. News Jul. 2025This summer, I will be attending SGP in Bilbao and Siggraph in Vancouver. If you're planning on attending either one and want to meet up, let me know! Apr. 2024I accepted an assistant professor position at the University of Utah's Kahlert School of Computing! I will start in fall 2026. Dec. 2024I will serve on the program committee for the 2025 Symposium on Geometry Processing (SGP). Sept. 2024I started a postdoc with Mathieu Desbrun at Ãcole Polytechnique. Aug. 2024Ray Tracing Harmonic Functions and Solid Knitting were both awarded Best Paper Honorable Mentions at Siggraph 2024. May 2024I defended my PhD thesis at CMU. Aug. 2023I was invited to attend the geometry workshop in Obergurgl, which was relocated to Innsbruck due to flooding in Ãtztal valley. Apr. 2019The National Science Foundation awarded me a Graduate Research Fellowship. Research Discrete Torsion of Connection Forms on Simplicial Meshes Theo Braune*, Mark Gillespie*, Yiying Tong, Mathieu Desbrun ACM Transactions on Graphics (SIGGRAPH 2025) Discrete connections are a staple of vector field design and analysis on meshes, but the notion of torsion of a discrete connection has remained unstudied. This is all the more surprising as torsion is a crucial ingredient of the smooth theory, underlying the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry. We extend the existing geometry processing toolbox by developing a theory of torsion for discrete connections. project pdf (7.2 mb) supplement (715 kb) bibtex @article{Braune:2025:DTC, author = {Braune, Theo and Gillespie, Mark and Tong, Yiying and Desbrun, Mathieu}, title = {Discrete Torsion of Connection Forms on Simplicial Meshes}, journal = {ACM Trans.

Sphere tracing is used throughout visual computing to render signed distance functions. We introduce an analogous algorithm for harmonic functions, opening up a range of possibilities: it can visualize point cloud reconstructions (via Poisson reconstruction) or polygon soups (via generalized winding numbers) without any linear solves or mesh extraction. We also show applications to Riemann surfaces, architectural grid shells, Seifert surfaces, and nonplanar polygons. project pdf (11.2 mb) code (ShaderToy) video (10 min) bibtex @article{Gillespie:2024:RTH, author = {Gillespie, Mark and Yang, Denise and Botsch, Mario and Crane, Keenan}, title = {Ray Tracing Harmonic Functions}, journal = {ACM Trans.

Bonilla Fominaya, James McCann ACM Transactions on Graphics (SIGGRAPH 2024) Best Paper (Honorable Mention) top 1.5% of accepted papers. Unlike standard knitting, which makes hollow surfaces, solid knitting creates dense volumes by layering knit sheetsâmuch as 3D printers layer sheets of plastic. We envision a future where everyday objects like furniture or shoes can be knit in one piece. We define the basic building blocks of solid knitting and demonstrate a prototype solid knitting machine controlled by a low-level instruction language, along with a volumetric design tool for creating machine-knittable patterns. project pdf (18.5 mb) video (5m) bibtex @article{Hirose:2024:SK, author = {Hirose, Yuichi and Gillespie, Mark and Bonilla Fominaya, Angelica M. and McCann, James}, title = {Solid Knitting}, journal = {ACM Trans.

I take as examples the problems of mesh simplification and surface parameterizationâin both cases, the intrinsic perspective leads to simple algorithms which are robust and efficient on a variety of challenging examples. pdf (25.5 mb) slides (75.9 mb) bibtex @phdthesis{Gillespie:2024:EIT, author = {Mark Gillespie}, title = {Evolving Intrinsic Triangulations}, school = {Carnegie Mellon University}, month = {April}, year = {2024} }Copy doi Winding Numbers on Discrete Surfaces Nicole Feng, Mark Gillespie, Keenan Crane ACM Transactions on Graphics (SIGGRAPH 2023) Winding numbers and their generalization to noisy data has proven invaluable in robust geometry processing. But standard definitions do not apply on surfaces, where not all curves bound regions. We develop a new generalization using the classic connections between winding numbers and harmonic functions. project pdf (11 mb) code video (10 min) bibtex @article{Feng:2023:WND, author = {Feng, Nicole and Gillespie, Mark and Crane, Keenan}, title = {Winding Numbers on Discrete Surfaces}, journal = {ACM Trans.

In the spirit of the quadric error metric (QEM), we perform greedy decimation while accumulating global error estimates. Rather than using extrinsic quadrics, however, we store intrinsic vectors that track how the mesh curvature drifts. project pdf (15.6 mb) code bibtex @article{Liu:2023:SSI, author = {Liu, Hsueh-Ti Derek and Gillespie, Mark and Chislett, Benjamin and Sharp, Nicholas and Jacobson, Alec and Crane, Keenan}, title = {Surface Simplification Using Intrinsic Error Metrics}, journal = {ACM Trans.

Our starting point is the framework of normal coordinates from geometric topology, which we extend to a broader set of operations needed for mesh processing. As a stress test, we successfully compute intrinsic Delaunay refinements and common subdivisions for all manifold meshes in the Thingi10k dataset. project pdf (7.6 mb) video (20 min) code (C++ demo) bibtex @article{Gillespie:2021:ICI, author = {Gillespie, Mark and Sharp, Nicholas and Crane, Keenan}, title = {Integer Coordinates for Intrinsic Geometry Processing}, journal = {ACM Trans.

The basic shift in perspective is to encode the geometry of a mesh not using vertex positions, but instead via edge lengths.
