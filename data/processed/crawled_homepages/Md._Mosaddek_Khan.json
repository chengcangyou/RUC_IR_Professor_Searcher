Before that, I served the same department as an Assistant Professor and Lecturer. I also initiate and direct a research group named Cognitive Agents and Interaction Lab at the University of Dhaka. I have received my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Southampton, UK in 2018 under the supervision of Prof. Nick Jennings CB, FREng and Dr Long Tran-Thanh. Prior to this, I have completed my MS and BSc in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Dhaka in 2012 and 2010, respectively. During the time, I was supervised by Prof. Md. Mamun-or-Rashid. I am particularly interested in conducting research in the field of Distributed Artificial Intelligence, often recognised as Multi-Agent Systems. Specifically, my research focuses on developing distributed decision making algorithms to deal with constraints in cooperative or competitive multi-agent systems. I am also interested in developing algorithms for different real-world applications by integrating deep learning and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methodologies.
