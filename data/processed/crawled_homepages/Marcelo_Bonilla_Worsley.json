I was born in Brazil and moved to the United States at 3 years old. When I was 9 years old my family moved to Belgium where I completed the majority of my primary education. Upon completing middle school, my family returned to Michigan, where I finished high school. In 2003, after high school, I moved to California to study Chemical Engineering and Portuguese at Stanford University, where I later completed a master’s degree in Computer Science and a PhD in Learning Sciences and Technology Design. When I’m not doing research I can normally be found cooking, reading, gardening, spending time with my family, or participating in a range of sporting activities: skiing, running, basketball, biking, capoeira, gymnastics, swimming, and soccer. I also like to take advantage of any opportunity to try or build something new. In the kitchen, this amounts to coming up with new recipes. In other areas, it results in a lot of “protoypes” that my oldest daughter gets to inherit as toys and props for fantasy play and drawing.Websites Marcelo’s Website Technological Innovations for Inclusive Learning and TeachingEducation Year Degree Institution 2014 PhD, Learning Sciences and Technology Design Stanford University 2014 MS, Computer Science Stanford University 2007 BA, Spanish and Portuguese Stanford University 2007 BS, Chemical Engineering Stanford University ResearchI have carried many titles in recent history: Education Research, Computer Scientist, Chemical Engineer, Social Entrepreneur, Humanist, Teacher, Medical Researcher, Mentor, Tutor, Volunteer, Technology Consultant. Throughout these titles, I have maintained a central focus on promoting and improving Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education among underserved populations through hands-on learning. My objective is not that all students necessarily pursue STEM careers. Instead, I want for students to realize their agency as innovators and inventors and use that lens to critically examine the world around them. To this end, my goal is for students to be able to create solutions to the problems that they encounter, regardless of the context, by drawing on their unique set of life experiences and perspectives. At the same time I want to empower students to have access to the resources that they need in order to bring their ideas to fruition. This is one of the reasons for my current research efforts in multimodal learning analytics. To support these efforts, my past and present research has been dedicated to doing process-oriented studies and can be divided into four primary areas: designing meaningful hands-on learning experiences; extracting multimodal data; analyzing and interpreting multimodal data; developing naturalistic interfaces.Selected Publications Works in Progress Worsley, M. & Blikstein, P.
