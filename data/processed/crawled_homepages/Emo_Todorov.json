It was then relocated to the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington in 2009. Everyone has now graduated and moved on to make exciting contributions in academia and industry. Emo Todorov also \"graduated\" and is now working on research and development at Roboti LLC. This is an archival page, previously hosted at the University of Washington. The lab focused on the control of complex movements in animals and robots. Biological movements can be modeled in detail using optimality principles - which is not surprising given that they are shaped by iterative optimization processes such as evolution, learning, adaptation. Similarly, the best way to engineer a complex control system is to specify a high-level performance criterion and leave the details to numerical optimization. In both areas, the main difficulty lies in actually performing the optimization. In our research we developed powerful methods for optimal control and learning, and applied them to challenging problems.
