Designing for Disclosure in Data Visualizations VIS 2025 Krisha Mehta, Gordon Kindlmann, Alex Kale The design of data visualizations usually induces information loss relative to the underlying dataset. After all, visualization is inherently a low-dimensional medium through which we project higher-dimensional information structures. In this paper, we propose a new theoretical lens for research on data interaction: we cast visualization as a mechanism for data disclosure. We develop a vocabulary around data operations that induce information loss in visualization design, and we demonstrate how this is framing unlocks the ability to reason through design trade-offs that are intractable to solve with conventional tools. pdf Towards a Logic of Generalization about Visualization as a Decision Aid VIS 2025 Alex Kale Visualization and HCAI research often makes and evaluates claims about the quality of displays as decision aids. How do we know that findings from this research generalize to decision contexts and populations beyond what was actually studied? In this paper, I critique the prevailing logic of generalization in visualization research as inadequate for the study of decision-making in particular, drawing on decision theory to ground my provokation in a formal account of heterogeneity in decision problems. pdf Decision Theoretic Foundations for Experiments Evaluating Human Decisions CHI 2025 Jessica Hullman, Alex Kale, Jason Hartline What makes a \"good\" decision experiment? We present a widely applicable definition of a well-formed decision problem, drawing on statistical decision theory, and demonstrate through examples how the results of decision experiments are uninterpretable when the problems presented to participants are not well-formed or are not analyzed as such. We apply this framework to decision experiments from the XAI and visualization literatures, pointing to widespread shortcomings in the way computer scientists study decision-making. pdf What Can Interactive Visualization do for Participatory Budgeting in Chicago? VIS 2024 Alex Kale, Danni Liu, Gabriela Ayala, Harper Schwab, and Andrew McNutt Participatory budgeting (PB) is a collective decision-making process where city residents vote on the allocation of funding to local projects. We examine the role that interactive visualization can play in PB efforts in Chicago by demonstrating design ideas through a design probe, and interviewing PB organizers and experts in digital civics. We point to ways visualization can help to create more expressive voting interfaces and to build civic capacity by facilitating interactive outreach activities. pdf osf prototype EVM: Incorporating Model Checking into Exploratory Visual Analysis VIS 2023 Alex Kale, Ziyang Guo, Xiao Li Qiao, Jeffrey Heer, and Jessica Hullman EVM (Exploratory Visual Modeling) integrates the ability to express and visually check regression models into a drag-and-drop visual analytics interface. In a typical visual analytics workflow, (A and B) analysts use visualizations to discover possible patterns of interest. With EVM's visual model checks, (C) analysts can rule out and compare of provisional data interpretations by scrutinizing the compatibility of observed data with model predictions. pdf github MetaExplorer: Facilitating Reasoning with Epistemic Uncertainty in Meta-analysis CHI 2023 Alex Kale, Sarah Lee, Terrance Goan, Elizabeth Tipton, and Jessica Hullman MetaExplorer provides a guided process for literature review and meta-analysis with an emphasis on documenting sources of epistemic uncertainty and choosing how to address them during statistical inference. The workflow proceeds in stages from Scoping and literature review where MetaExplorer elicits information about each study, to Triage and study grouping where the user resolves sources of epistemic uncertainty, and finally to Meta-analysis where the user views results alongside contextualizing uncertainty. pdf github Causal Support: Modeling Causal Inferences with Visualizations VIS 2021, Honorable Mention Award ð Alex Kale, Yifan Wu, and Jessica Hullman Modeling causal inferences with visualizations: (A) Users view and may interact with data visualizations; (B) Ideally, users reason through a series of comparisons that allow them to allocate subjective probabilities to possible data generating processes; and (C) We elicit usersâ subjective probabilities as a Dirichlet distribution across possible causal explanations and compare these causal inferences to a computed benchmark of causal support, which we derive from Bayesian inference across possible causal models. pdf github prereg for E1 prereg for E2 Visual Reasoning Strategies for Effect Size Judgments and Decisions VIS 2020, InfoVis Best Paper Award ð Alex Kale, Matthew Kay, and Jessica Hullman We present a mixed design experiment on Mechanical Turk which tests eight uncertainty visualization designs: intervals, hypothetical outcome plots, densities, and quantile dotplots, each with and without means added. Participants estimate the effect size of an intervention and make an incentivized decision whether or not to pay for that intervention. Our results suggest that many users rely on the sub-optimal strategy of judging the distance between distributions while ignoring uncertainty. Visualization designs that support the least biased estimation do not support the best decisions, suggesting that a chart userâs sense of the signal in a chart may vary for different tasks. pdf github osf prereg Boba: Authoring and Visualizing Multiverse Analyses VIS 2020 Yang Liu, Alex Kale, Tim Althoff, and Jeffrey Heer Boba is an integrated domain-specific language (DSL) and visual analysis system for authoring and visually exploring multiverse analyses. The Boba DSL enables analysts to specify decision spaces in data analysis, supporting multiple scripting languages. The Boba Visualizer provides linked views of the decision space and model results to enable rapid, systematic assessment of robustness of results to decision alternatives, sampling uncertainty, and model fit. pdf github video osf bibtex Adaptation and Learning Priors in Visual Inference Position Paper VIS 2019 Alex Kale and Jessica Hullman We review the vision science literature on adaption, a set of processes by which the visual system adjusts incoming sensory signals based on previous visual experience. We present an explanation of visual adaptation that is tailored to the visualization community and consider the implications of adaptation when designing for inferences from visualized data. pdf Designing for Epistemic Uncertainty in Research Synthesis University of Wisconsin at Madison 2023 - Seminar on Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Summarizing what can be learned from bodies of scientific literature requires difficult judgments about which study results can be meaningfully compared, and whether it makes sense to aggregate evidence in a meta-analysis. Numerous tools for assessing quality of evidence offer guidance on identifying sources of epistemic uncertainty, such as common threats to internal or external validity of study results. However, existing software for systematic review and meta-analysis does little to emphasize how epistemic uncertainty should inform analytic choices for synthesizing findings. I present MetaExplorer, a prototype web application designed to provide a guided process for reasoning about epistemic uncertainty in meta-analysis. I also summarize findings from interviews with research synthesis methodologists and practitioners in biomedical science, education, computer science, and statistics. This work highlights the cognitive pitfalls, technical hurdles, and inconsistent standards across research communities that pose challenges to addressing epistemic uncertainty in research synthesis. I reflect on opportunities for future software development and invite the audience to join me in discussion. Data Visualization for Decision Making University of Chicago Booth School of Business 2023 - Behavioral Science Seminar Series When visualization researchers and practitioners talk about the value of data visualization, one of the most commonly cited use cases is helping people make informed decisions. It is often assumed that people making decisions will benefit from mere information exposure, that if one can read data off of a chart, they will be able to use that information for the purpose of decision making. However, relatively little behavioral research on data visualization has applied theories and models from economics to investigate how well chart users can make utility-optimal decisions when relying on different displays. I present an experiment that investigates how well various forms of uncertainty visualization support decision making, specifically an incentivized choice about whether to pay for an intervention. In this study, I looked not only at which visualization designs best support decisions but also how well those same representations support chart users in estimating the effect size of the intervention versus the status quo. Through a combination of hypothesis testing, descriptive behavioral modeling, and qualitative analysis of users' self-reported chart interpretation strategies, I explain the effectiveness of various visual representations in terms of the heuristics or visual reasoning strategies that people apply when making decisions with uncertainty visualizations. I discuss how incorporating economic formalisms and knowledge of visual reasoning strategies into visualization research can help us build data analysis software that is better aligned with natural tendencies of human judgment and decision making.
