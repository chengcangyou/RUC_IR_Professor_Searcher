His work develops programming languages and tools that help people build software that is correct, safe, and efficient. His scholarly work regularly appears in flagship programming languages (POPL, PLDI, OOPSLA, ICFP) and software engineering conferences (ICSE, FSE), and has been recognized with ACM SIGPLAN Distinguished Paper awards. Shuchin Aeron Professor Machine Learning, Statistical Signal Processing, Information Theory, Optimal Transport Bruce Boghosian Professor Applied dynamical systems, applied probability theory, kinetic theory, agent-based modeling, mathematical models of the economy, theoretical and computational fluid dynamics, complex systems science, quantum computation Current research emphasis is on mathematical models of economics in general, and agent-based models of wealth distributions in particular. The group's work has shed new light on the tendency of wealth to concentrate, and has discovered new results for upward mobility, wealth autocorrelation, and the flux of agents and wealth. The group's mathematical description of the phenomenon of oligarchy has also shed new light on functional analysis in general and distribution theory in particular. Secondary projects include new directions in lattice Boltzmann and lattice-gas models of fluid dynamics, kinetic theory, and quantum computation.

Peter Love Professor Quantum Information, Quantum Simulation, Adiabatic Quantum Computation, Computational Physics Quantum information faces three basic questions. Firstly, what are quantum computers good for? Secondly, how do we build one? Thirdly, what will quantum information contribute if technological obstacles to constructing a large scale quantum computer prove insuperable? The first question is the search for problems which quantum computers can solve more easily than classical computers. The second is an investigation of which physical systems one could use to build a quantum computer. The third leads to the search for spinoffs in classical computation, and the question of where the classical/quantum boundary lies. I am interested in all three questions. Eric Miller Professor Statistical- and physics-based signal and image modeling and processing, tomographic image formation and object characterization, and inverse problems.
