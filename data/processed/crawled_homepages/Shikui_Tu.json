Biography I am a tenured associate professor (é¿èå¯ææ) at Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). I am also an academic assistant to the department head, and to the head of Center for Cognitive Machines and Computational Health (CMaCHï¼çµä¿¡å­¦é¢è®¤ç¥æºå¨ä¸è®¡ç®å¥åº·ç ç©¶ä¸­å¿), School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering (SEIEE), SJTU. I obtained my B.Sc. from School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University (PKU), in 2006, and Ph.D. from Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in 2012, under the supervision of Professor Lei Xu. I worked as postdoctoral associate in Program in Bioinformatics and Integrative Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, between 2012 and 2017, under Professor Zhiping Weng and also Professor Craig Mello who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2006. Research Interests My research interests include machine learning, bioinformatics, and also neural combinatorial optimization, drug discovery, causal discovery and reasoning, computational finance. I have published more than 80 academic papers in top conferences, e.g., NeurIPS/ICML/AAAI/IJCAI, and the journals with high impact factors, including Science, Cell, Nature Communications, Nature Structural and Molecular Biology, and so on.
