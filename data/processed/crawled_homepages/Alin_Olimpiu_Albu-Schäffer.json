In particular, he is interested in robots and algorithms for direct, safe and intuitive interaction with humans and unknown environments. A major emphasis of this research work is the processing and feedback of heterogeneous sensor information within ultra-lightweight, compliant robots inspired by biological systems. The main areas of application are robotic assistance in space, industrial manufacturing, health-care and home environments.Professor Alin Albu-Schäffer completed his studies in electrical engineering at TU Timisoara in Romania in 1993 and obtained his PhD in 2002 from TUM. Since 1995 he has been a researcher at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) where he has headed the Department of Mechatronic Components and Systems since 2009. In 2012 Professor Albu-Schäffer was simultaneously appointed full professor at TUM in the Department of Computer Science and director of the Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics at DLR. He is currently on leave of absence from TUM on account of his role as institute director at DLR. Despite this he continues to teach a limited number of courses at TUM and heads a small research group focusing on robotics.
