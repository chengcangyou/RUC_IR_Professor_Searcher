I have a broad base of knowledge in computational biology, computer science, statistics, neurobiology, general biology, avian biology, genomics, genetics, personal genomics, and epigenetics, with a focus on analysis of stimulus-activated gene regulation in the brain. I was born in Pittsburgh and grew up there in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood. My father's from Germany and I picked up the language by spending summers there. These days, I enjoy running, swimming, cross country skiing, and cooking with my wife, Mary. When we can, we spend time at York Beach in Maine or in the White Mountains of New Hampshire.
