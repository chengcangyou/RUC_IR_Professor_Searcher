These ML software systems must enable, automate, and optimize over multiple tasks: composition of elementary ML program and systems “building blocks” to create sophisticated applications, scaling to very large data and model sizes, resource allocation and scheduling, hyperparameter tuning, and code-to-hardware placement. Email Share Prior to joining MBZUAI, Professor Ho co-founded and CTO at Petuum Inc., a unicorn AI startup which has been recognized as a World Economic Forum Tech Pioneer for creating standardized building blocks that enable assembly-line production of AI, in a manner that is affordable, sustainable, scalable, and requires less training of AI workers. Professor Ho is a member of the Technical Committee for the Composable, Automatic and Scalable ML (CASL) open-source consortium. His doctoral thesis received the 2015 SIGKDD Dissertation Award (runner-up). Ph.D. in machine learning from Carnegie Mellon University, USA. Bachelor of Science in computational biology from Carnegie Mellon University, USA Jay Lepreau Best Paper Award, the 15th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation, 2021 (OSDI '21) Best Paper Award, Managed Communication and Consistency for Fast Data-Parallel Iterative Analytics, ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing, 2015 (SoCC 2015) 2015 SIGKDD Dissertation Award (runner-up) for his doctoral thesis.
