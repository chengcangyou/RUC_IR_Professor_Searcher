It is where you go when you get the letter saying: Flee, all is discovered. It is where you go when you look down at the blade in your hand and see the blood on it. It is where you go when you are told that you are a bubble on the tide of empire. It is where you go when you hear that thar's gold in them-thar hills. It is where you go to grow up with the country. It is where you go to spend your old age. Or it is just where you go. It was just where I went. - Robert Penn Warren Olin Shivers Room 318 College of Computer and Information Science WVH-202 Northeastern University Boston, Mass. 02115 +1 617 373.31.46 (voice) I'm a professor in the College of Computer and Information Science at Northeastern University. My research interests are programming languages, compilers, and systems. At Northeastern, I frequently teach Compilers in the Fall. In Spring 2026, I will be teaching a graduate compilers course on the technology specific to compiling functional languages based on Church's Lambda Calculus, such as OCaml, SML, Haskell, Scheme or Racket. Students in the class, of course, will build an optimising compiler for such a language over the course of the class; the class project will produce a compiler at roughly the level of sophistication of SML/NJ or Racket's Chez compiler. Full information about the class can be found at the course web site (including the course number and CRN). Although it is a graduate class, the class is open to interested undergraduates with instructor permission --- send me an email and tell me about your interest and prior preparation for the course.
