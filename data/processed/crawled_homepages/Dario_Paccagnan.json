Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Control, Dynamical System, and Computations, UCSB hosted by Prof. Francesco Bullo and Prof. Jason Marden. I received a PhD in optimization and control from ETH Zurich under the guidance of Prof. John Lygeros. I was awarded a B.Sc. and two M.Sc. degrees from the University of Padova, and the Technical University of Denmark under the TIME double degree program. Research: I am interested in the modeling, analysis, and control of multi-agent systems. I am also interested in safe control and learning theory. My research leverages both theoretical models and real-world applications. Applications: future mobility and electricity markets. Keywords: game theory, controls, learning, optimization.

[photo] 2025 May: In our AISTATS â25 oral, we show that subset-of-data methods to train Gaussian Processes are self-certified, i.e., they come with tight out-of-sample guarantees 2025 Apr: It has been fantastic to present Pick-to-Learn to some of the most exciting research groups in the west coast! A thousand thanks to Marco Pavone (Stanford), Shankar Sastry (UC Berkeley), Adam Wierman (Caltech), Boris Ivanovic (NVIDIA), Francesco Bullo and Jason Marden (UCSB), Jorge Poveda (UCSD), Lars Lindemann (USC) 2025 Apr: Kai presented WardropNet at ICLR â25: surprisingly simple combinatorial layers are good at predicting traffic patterns 2025 Mar: Exciting to be collaborating with Gioele Zardini (MIT) thanks to the MIT-IMPERIAL Seed Fund 2024 December: In our WINE '24 paper, Miriam studies the power and limitations of fair interventions in weighted congestion games. 2024 Feb: It seems I have been lagging behind with the updates in the last year. Here are some recent highlights: excited about our NeurIPS '23 spotlight paper on compression, Aamal's ICML '23 work on tradeoffs in learning in games, our Operations Research '23 paper on taxes and social optima in congestion games, and being promoted to Senior Lecturer in Sept 2023! 2023 Sept: In our recent NeurIPS spotlight paper, Marco Campi, Simone Garatti and I show how any black-box learning algorithm can be turned into a compression scheme, thus allowing to jointly learn models with state-of-the-art performance and obtain tight generalization bounds. 2022 Feb: Congratulations to Keyang for his work \"Competition and Inefficiency in Urban Last-Mile Delivery\" to appear at AAMAS'22 2022 Feb: In congestion games, minimizing the Price of Anarchy has undesirable consequences on the Price of Stability, see Rahul's work - 2021 Nov: Starting from November, Aris and I are organising \"Frontiers in Economics and Computation - UK\" a monthly seminar series on Economics and Computation, Game Theory, Optimisation in a broad sense 2021 Sep: At CDC'21, we are organizing the workshop \"Control for Autonomous Cities\".
