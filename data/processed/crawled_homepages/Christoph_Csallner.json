Proc. 46th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE), 2024. (GitHub, Docker) TreeVada is the first black-box approach that quickly infers a high-quality context-free grammar from sample programs. TreeVada starts with a few given valid sample programs of some language L, where the language may be a programming language that is not widely used. To decide if a program is valid, TreeVada uses a parser (or compiler) for L as a black-box, as the parser may run on a remote machine and cannot be instrumented. D2S2: Drag 'n' drop mobile app screen search. Proc. 31st ACM Joint European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (ESEC/FSE), Demonstrations Track, 2023. (search engine, GitHub, YouTube) D2S2 (http://pixeltoapp.com/D2S2) is the first interactive drag-and-drop search engine for mobile app screenshots. D2S2 encodes text queries and the location, size, and icon type of the icons a user dragged on D2S2's UI. In a preliminary experiment D2S2 produced significantly more relevant search results than Google Image Search. ScoutSL: An open-source Simulink search engine. Proc. 26th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS), Tools and Demonstrations Track, 2023. (search engine, survey responses, source code, YouTube) ScoutSL (http://scoutsl.net) is a web-based Simulink search engine. Users can search via free-form Google-style keywords and via Simulink model and project metrics (such as models' cyclomatic complexity or the number of GitHub pull requests) in 100k open-source Simulink models from 18k GitHub and MATLAB Central projects. EvoSL: A large open-source corpus of changes in Simulink models & projects. Proc. 26th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS), 2023. (dataset, tool) EvoSL is the first large redistributable corpus of open-source Simulink models that contains project change histories. EvoSL contains 924 Git repositories from GitHub with their 3k issues, 2k pull requests, 10k comments, and over 100k commits. On a EvoSL subset we replicate a recent Simulink model change study carried out on a closed-source industrial project. Replicability study: Corpora for understanding Simulink models & projects. Proc. 17th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM), 2023. (dataset, tool) To address reproducibility issues, we re-collect two corpora of open-source Simulink models and compare them with the largest known corpus (SLNET). On SLNET we replicate earlier studies and find, among others, that cyclomatic complexity of Simulink models does not seem to be strongly correlated with other model metrics. Open-source Simulink Datasets SLNET: A redistributable corpus of 3rd-party Simulink models. Proc. 19th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR), Data and Tool Showcase Track, 2022. (dataset, metrics tool, mining tool, YouTube) SLNET contains 9,117 third-party Simulink models from 2,837 open-source projects from GitHub and MATLAB Central that are licensed for re-distribution. A curated corpus of Simulink models for model-based empirical studies. Proc. 4th International Workshop on Software Engineering for Smart Cyber-Physical Systems (SEsCPS), 2018. (bib, doi, tool, slides) This paper presents a corpus of over 1,000 freely available MathWorks Simulink models. Mobile Software Engineering PSDoodle: Fast app screen search via partial screen doodle. Proc. 9th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Mobile Software Engineering and Systems (MOBILESoft), 2022. (search engine, GitHub, YouTube: 90 seconds, 15 minutes) Existing screen search tools are either keyword-based (Google Image Search) or require the user to produce a sketch of a complete screen. PSDoodle (http://pixeltoapp.com/PSDoodle) is the first tool to allow interactive screen search via interactive freehand sketching. PSDoodle: Searching for app screens via interactive sketching. Proc. 9th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Mobile Software Engineering and Systems (MOBILESoft), Tool Demos and Mobile Apps Track, 2022. (tool, GitHub, YouTube: 90 seconds, 10 minutes) This paper adds details on PSDoodle's architecture, deployment, and evaluation. Doodle2App: Native app code by freehand UI sketching. Proc. 7th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Mobile Software Engineering and Systems (MOBILESoft), Tool Demos and Mobile Apps Track, 2020. (tool, slides) We trained Doodle2App (http://pixeltoapp.com/doodle) on thousands of (manually created) freehand sketches of 20 common Android UI elements. The resulting website allows users to sketch an Android screen. The website then converts the sketched screen to Android code that is ready to compile and run on stock Android phones. In technical terms: We pre-trained a classifier on 2 million Google \"Quick, Draw!\" sketches and retrained the classifier on thousands of sketches collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk. In some sense the resulting tool is a modern version of SILK (\"Sketching Interfaces Like Krazy\"). SPEjs: A symbolic partial evaluator for JavaScript. Proc. 1st International Workshop on Advances in Mobile App Analysis (A-Mobile), 2018. (bib, doi, tool, slides) The partial evaluator SPEjs implements a symbolic execution engine for JavaScript and uses Z3 to resolve the feasibility of program execution paths. SPEjs removes some dead branches that the state-of-the-art partial evaluator Prepack from Facebook so far cannot remove. P2A: A tool for converting pixels to animated mobile application user interfaces. Proc. 5th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Mobile Software Engineering and Systems (MOBILESoft), 2018. (bib, doi, slides) P2A takes as input a set of screen design bitmaps (e.g., screenshots of an Android or iPhone app) and converts them to native app code (i.e., for Android), complete with inter-screen transitions and in-screen animations. P2A is implemented on top of REMAUI. Reverse engineering mobile application user interfaces with REMAUI. Proc. 30th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE), 2015. (bib, doi, slides, award) When developing a mobile app (e.g., for Android or iOS), a graphic designer typically designs the app's screens and hands them to a programmer, who manually recreates the screen designs in source code. REMAUI is the first technique for automating this process end-to-end, from design drawings or screenshots to working UI code that can be compiled and run on a mobile device. Received an ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award. GROPG: A graphical on-phone debugger. Proc. 35th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE), New Ideas and Emerging Results (NIER) track, 2013. (bib, doi, slides, poster) GROPG is the first graphical on-phone debugger. Developers can use GROPG to debug Android phone applications dir",
