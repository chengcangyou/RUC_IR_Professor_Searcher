Algorithmik Group Institute for Formal Methods of Computer Science (FMI) Algorithmics, Computational Geometry, Discrete Optimization, Algorithm Engineering What we do Our main interest lies in the development and analysis of algorithms for various problem scenarios. Here our focus is on algorithms with provable guarantees, both in terms of running times as well as quality of the outcome. This interest is reflected in both our research as well as teaching activities, where we regularly offer modules like Discrete Optimization, Computational Geometry, Algorithm Engineering, Lab Courses, and Seminars.
