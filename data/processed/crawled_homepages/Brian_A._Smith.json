Smith is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University and the director of the Computer-Enabled Abilities Laboratory (CEAL). He is a member of the Data Science Institute and Center for Smart Streetscapes. His research goal is to develop computers that act as true partners in human ability, augmenting rather than replacing it. Instead of developing more intelligent systems alone, he focuses on the experiences they create and how to make them more meaningful, even if it means rethinking the role of computers in different contexts. He collaborates with industry, nonprofits, and governments to solve problems that require new thinking in AI, human factors, and design. He received his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. in Computer Science from Columbia University. He has been recognized as a Kavli Fellow and has received several honors including the NSF CAREER Award, Columbia Engineering's Distinguished Faculty Teaching Award, and Columbia Engineering's Avanessians Award for advancing undergraduate engineering. He finds advising deeply fulfilling and is passionate about uniting people to maximize their impact on the world.",
