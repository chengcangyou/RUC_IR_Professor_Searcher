Especially, by investigating the brain cognition mechanism, I develop generalized and efficient machine learning system that can adapt to new domains and modalities with limited labels.Rethinking Distributional Matching based Domain Adaptation Systematically analyze the existing Distributional Matching based DA methods, and find they can only work under simple covariate/label shift with strong assumptions, while they may fail in real-world problems which have Label Distribution Shift or Pseudo Label Distribution Shift. Propose a new instance-based information matching DA algorithm that is more robust to these distributional shifts. PaperCompositional Few-Shot Learning Provide a compositional view of the widely adopted FSL baseline model. Based on this view, to imitate humans' ability of learning visual primitives and composing primitives to recognize novel classes, we propose an approach to FSL to learn a feature representation composed of important primitives, which is jointly trained with primitive discovery and primitive enhancing. Learning Invariant Risks and Representations for Domain Adaptation Derive tighter upper bound for semi-DA, which simultaneously achieves marginal and conditional distribution alignment. Based on this upper bound, we propose the Invariant Risks and Representations Minimization framework to solve the semi-supervised DA as an invariant integrity optimization problem across domains from the informatic point of view. PaperMulti-source Distilling Domain AdaptationPropose a novel multi-source distilling domain adaptation (MDDA) network, which not only considers the different distances among multiple sources and the target, but also investigates the different similarities of the source samples to the target ones.PaperPaperTopology Adaptive Graph Convolutional NetworksPropose the topology adaptive graph convolutional network, a novel graph convolutional network that generalizes CNN architectures to graph-structured data and provides a systematic way to design a set of fixed-size learnable filters to perform convolutions on graphs. The topologies of these filters are adaptive to the topology of the graph when they scan the graph to perform convolution, replacing the square filter for the grid-structured data in traditional CNNs. It can be used with both directed and undirected graphs.Multiple Source Domain Adaptation with Adversarial Training of Neural Networks Propose a new generalization bound for domain adaptation when there are multiple source domains with labeled instances and one target domain with unlabeled instances. Propose an efficient implementation of the theoretical results using adversarial neural networks: Learn feature representations that are invariant to the multiple domain shifts while still being discriminative for the learning task. PaperPaperLong Term Time-Series Transformer   Time-series forecasting is a long-standing problem in machine learning, and it remains as a sequence to sequence prediction paradigm. Recent works on the Transformer have revealed that the self-attention mechanism improves the sequence alignment performance and easily handles massive input sequences in Natural Language Processing. Inspired by this, we proposed a Long Term Time-series Transformer (LT^3) targeting the long term sequences' prediction. Our model has three distinctive characteristics: Uniform inputs representation, a scaled combination of the scalar projection and time-stamp embeddings,  provides a way to measure quantity change and temporal shift simultaneously; Self-attention distilling, a conv-maxpool operation halving cascading layer inputs, privileges dominating attention compositions and sharply reduces the size of network; Dependency pyramid, subsequently truncated self-attention stacks at cross-scale, allows the encoder to fetch a diversified resolution of self-attention feature map. Generalized Zero-Shot Learning Generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) is a challenging class of vision and knowledge transfer problems in which both seen and unseen classes appear during testing. We propose the Dual Adversarial Semantics-Consistent Network (DASCN), which learns primal and dual Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in a unified framework for GZSL. In particular, the primal GAN learns to synthesize inter-class discriminative and semantics-preserving visual features from both the semantic representations of seen/unseen classes and the ones reconstructed by the dual GAN. The dual GAN enforces the synthetic visual features to represent prior semantic knowledge well via semantics-consistent adversarial learning. Generalized zero-shot learning for ICD coding, which is essentially the multi-label classification with structural label space.
