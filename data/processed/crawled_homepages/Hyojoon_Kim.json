I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia.Before joining UVA, I worked as a Research Scholar/Scientist at Princeton University. I received my Ph.D. and M.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech and my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin - Madison.My CV is here (PDF)ContactRice Hall Room 500. 85 Engineer’s Way. Charlottesville, Virginia 22904 Email: tcr5zr@virginia.eduResearchMy research focuses on making computer networks easier to monitor, understand, troubleshoot, and configure. I enjoy designing fast and accurate mechanisms that analyze real-world traffic and extract useful information for network practitioners. I am passionate about designing and implementing better tools and systems for next-generation applications and networks. I often use tools and mechanisms in software-defined networking (SDN), P4, and programmable data planes. I am also enthusiastic about applying new ideas to real operational networks.News10/2025: Md.
