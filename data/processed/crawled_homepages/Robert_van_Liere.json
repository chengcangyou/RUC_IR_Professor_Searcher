Robert van Liere is a senior researcher at Center for Mathematics and Computer Science (CWI) in Amsterdam, where he heads the Visualization and Virtual Reality research group. He also holds a part-time position as full professor at the Technical University in Eindhoven. Prior to joining CWI in 1985 he worked at TNO-IBBC, a Dutch institute for building and construction research in Rijswijk. Robert received a Ph.D. in computer science from University of Amsterdam and a master degree in computer science from University of Delft. His research interests involve interactive visualization, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction. He has served on numerous program commitees, has been involved in the organization of various workshops / symposiums / conferences, and is a member of the IEEE and EuroGraphics. Robert was born in Beirut, Lebanon. He is fortunate to have lived and visited many countries and seen many different cultures. Proir to moving to the Netherlands, he lived in Syria (1956-1964), Lebanon (1964-1967) and Thailand (1967-1974). His hobbies include transcontinental travelling and biking. The blue dots on the map in the left image below show the capitals of the countries/states which have been visited. The right image is a recent picture on the bike somewhere close to Lucca, Italy.

Visualization and Virtual Reality Research At CWI, I head the Visualization and Virtual Reality group. This group studies those mechanisms that support the development of visualization techniques at the systems and user levels. These techniques include those found in virtual reality and and data visualization. The applications studied originate from joint projects with partners, who bring in the application domain expertise. An example is the Bio-VR project with cell biologists from the University of Amsterdam. Recent developments in laser scanning confocal microscopy have allowed biologists to obtain high quality 4D-images of biological objects, such as cells and tissues. A fundamental problem in understanding cellular structures is the inherent complexity and spatial relationships of these structures. We have studied the idea of exploring cell structures in a virtual environment. The combination of stereoscopic graphics and head-coupled displays can aid in the unambiguous display of complex cell structures. Interaction techniques coupled to spatial input devices provide the users a natural means of directly manipulating with the underlying data. Two topics are addressed in the visualization group: from the user's perspective, how does the application of interactive visualization result in a more effective modeling, computation and analysis cycle? at the systems level, how can the development costs of interactive visualization applications be lowered? Solutions to the resulting research questions involve the development of innovative techniques for the visualization of and interaction with the underlying data, as well as the development of innovative techniques for the simplification of resulting visual representations. I believe that the development of small-scale prototype systems is essential to the understanding of the problems associated with visualization research, although the research results will extend beyond the building of proof-of-concept implementation systems.
