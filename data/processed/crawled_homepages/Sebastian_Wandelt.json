My work is broadly on the design and evaluation of scalable algorithms and data management techniques, with a focus the underlying computational challenges. The application domains are various, including intelligent transportation systems, complex networks, bioinformatics. In addition, I have an interest in the robustness and evolution of all kinds of systems. The results of my research are published in leading transportation journals (e.g., Transportation Science, Transportation Research Part A/B/C/E, Transport Policy, and IEEE T-ITS), as well as computer science journals (e.g., Future Generation Computer Systems and Information Sciences) and conferences (e.g., PVLDB). A list of recent key publications can be found below. According to my wide area of interest, I am an active and reliable reviewer for many international journals, including Nature Biotechnology, Transportation Research Part A/B/C/D/E, Transportmetrica A/B, and several IEEE Transactions, such as Vehicular Technology / Intelligent Transportation Systems / Knowledge and Data Engineering. I also occasionally review for several Computer Science and Bioinformatics journals, given my past research interests. Ten selected key publications:Sebastian Wandelt, Anming Zhang, et al.
