This has included developing evaluation metrics, designing algorithms, and understanding the broader, societal implications of these technologies. My recent work spans preference-based evaluation and fairness in ranking, understanding AI's impact on culture industries, retrieval-enhanced machine learning, and tip-of-the-tongue retrieval algorithms. My previous projects have included text summarization in crisis informatics contexts, inferring user intent from mouse cursor behavior, aggregated search, time-sensitive ranking, and core retrieval algorithms.
