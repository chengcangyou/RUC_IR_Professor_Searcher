She has held visiting positions at the University of South Australia in 2005, the Technical University of Berlin in 2007 and the University of Canterbury, New Zealand in 2011. She has also worked as a consultant at Volvo Technology during 2005-2009 dealing with connected vehicles, as a consultant at Ikanos Communications, CA, USA, in 2005 with VDSL protocols and at Free2move, Sweden, during 2009-2010 with wireless audio. Currently, she is a full professor in Data Communications at Malardalen University, Sweden. She has been involved in several European projects studying communication requirements for traffic-safety applications in vehicular networks. She also contributed to the European ITS communications architecture and has served as a technical expert in standardization within ETSI TC ITS. She currently serves as senior editor for IEEE VT Magazine on Connected and Automated Vehicles and has served as a member of different PhD examination committees over 20 times in five different countries. She is a senior member of the IEEE and vice chair of the Swedish VT/COM/IT chapter.Research interests include wireless vehicular networks, industrial wireless communications, real-time constraints, medium access control, diversity, redundancy, relaying, iterative techniques, incremental redundancy .
