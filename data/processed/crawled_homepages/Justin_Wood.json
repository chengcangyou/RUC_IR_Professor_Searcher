Broader ImpactWe study newborn animals to discover general principles of how brains work. This understanding will illuminate how babies learn about the world and provide benchmarks for building artificial brains that learn like newborn brains. Our Mission:Understand the Origins of Intelligence Develop high-precision methods for studying newborn animalsUse those methods to obtain precise benchmarks of the origins of core cognitive abilitiesUse those benchmarks to build autonomous artificial agents (end-to-end computational models) formalizing the learning mechanisms in newborn brains Our studies are supported by:",
