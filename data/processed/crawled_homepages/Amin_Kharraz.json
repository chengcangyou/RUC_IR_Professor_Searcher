An overarching theme of my research has been to enable evaluating implications of emerging technologies and their associated threats. I apply data-driven techniques to rigorously analyze online threats and build research tools to discover them in a scalable and reliable manner. My research requires knowledge of fundamental areas in computer science such as software engineering, machine learning, computer networks, and operating systems. This has allowed me to work on multiple topics such as Web and browser security, code analysis, and malware detection. I am always looking for new talented members to join SecLab. If you are a graduate student with strong computer science background or undergrad who wants to learn more about systems security, I would like to chat with you!

In response to such attacks, both academia and industry have investigated techniques to model and reconstruct these attacks and to defend against them. While such efforts have been all useful in mitigating the effects of modern attacks, automated malware code reuse inspection and campaign attribution have received less attention. In this paper, we present an automated system, called SCRUTINIZER, to identify code reuse in malware via a novel machine learning-based encoding mechanism at the function-level. By creating a large knowledge base of previously observed and tagged malware campaigns, we can compare unknown samples against this knowledge base and determine how much overlap exists. SCRUTINIZER leverages an unsupervised learning approach to filter out irrelevant functions before code reuse detection. It provides two valuable capabilities. First, it identifies ties between an unknown sample and those malware specimens that are known to be used by a specific campaign. Second, it inspects if specific tools or functionalities are used by a campaign. Using SCRUTINIZER, we were able to identify 12 samples that were previously unknown to us and that we were able to correctly assign to well-known APT campaigns. Tommaso Innocenti, Seyed Ali Mirheidari, Amin Kharraz,Bruno Crispo, and Engin Kirda, Youâve Got (a Reset) Mail: A Security Analysis of Email-Based Password Reset Procedures, The Proceedings of the 2021 Detection of Intrusion and Malware and Vulrnerability Assessment (DIMVA), Lisboa, Portugal, July 2021 Abstract PDF BibTex The password recovery process is a critical part of a websiteâs functionality. Many websites that provide online services to their users also need to solve the problem of allowing their users to reset their passwords (e.g., if they have forgotten it). A popular, established technique for allowing a user to recover a lost account is to allow her to send a reset link to her own account via email. Although it might seem easy at a first glance, the security requirements of the password recovery process require web sites to carefully design each step of the process to be resilient even in the presence of an attack. In this paper, we present an in-depth security analysis of the email-based recovery mechanisms of a wide range of web applications. By manually registering accounts and triggering the password recovery process for each website, we were able to study the password reset mechanisms of web sites from three different groups in the Alexa Top 5K (i.e., popular sites, medium popular sites, low popular sites). In this work, we show that the lack of standards in the password recovery process plagues many websites with security weaknesses, and negatively influences the security of the reset process itself. We also show that concrete password-recovery reset attacks can be launched against a high percentage of websites that might even lead to account takeover. Paul Murley, Zane Ma, Joshua Mason, Michael Bailey, Amin Kharraz, WebSocket Adoption and the Landscape of the Real-Time Web, The Proceedings of the 2021 World Wide Web Conference (WWW '21), Ljubljana, Slovenia, April 2021 Abstract PDF BibTex Developers are increasingly deploying web applications which require real-time bidirectional updates, a use case which does not naturally align with the traditional client-server architecture of the web. Many solutions have arisen to address this need over the preceding decades, including HTTP polling, Server-Sent Events, and WebSockets. This paper investigates this ecosystem and reports on the prevalence, benefits, and drawbacks of these technologies, with a particular focus on the adoption of WebSockets. We crawl the Tranco Top 1 Million websites to build a dataset for studying real-time updates in the wild. We find that HTTP Polling remains significantly more common than WebSockets, and WebSocket adoption appears to have stagnated in the past two to three years. We investigate some of the possible reasons for this decrease in the rate of adoption, and we contrast the adoption process to that of other web technologies. Our findings further suggest that even when WebSockets are employed, the prescribed best practices for securing them are often disregarded. The dataset is made available in the hopes that it may help inform the development of future real-time solutions for the web. Bahruz Jabiyev, Omid Mirzaei, Amin Kharraz, Engin Kirda, Preventing Server-Side Request Forgery Attacks, In 36th ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC 2021), Gwangju, Korea, May 2021 Abstract PDF BibTex In todayâs web, it is not uncommon for web applications to take acomplete URL as input from users. Usually, once the web applicationreceives a URL, the server opens a connection to it. However, ifthe URL points to an internal service and the server still makes theconnection, the server becomes vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. These attacks can be highly destructivewhen they exploit internal services. They are equally destructiveand need much less effort to succeed if the server is hosted in a cloudenvironment. Therefore, with the growing use of cloud computing,the threat of SSRF attacks is becoming more serious.In this paper, we present a novel defense approach to protectinternal services from SSRF attacks. Our analysis of more than 60SSRF vulnerability reports shows that developersâ awareness aboutthis vulnerability is generally limited. Therefore, coders usuallyhave flaws in their defenses. Even when these defenses have noflaws, they are usually still affected by important security andfunctionality limitations. In this work, we develop a prototypebased on the proposed approa",
