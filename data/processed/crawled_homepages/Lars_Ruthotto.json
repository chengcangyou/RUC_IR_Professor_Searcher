I am a Winship Distinguished Research Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Computer Science at Emory University and a member of Emory’s Scientific Computing Group. I lead the Emory REU/RET site for Computational Mathematics for Data Science. Prior to joining Emory, I was a postdoc at the University of British Columbia and I held PhD positions at the University of LÃ¼beck and the University of MÃ¼nster. Research Scientific Computing Numerical algorithms for high-dimensional differential equations, optimization, and inference Artificial Intelligence Generative models, continuous-time deep learning, mixed-precision training, and efficient numerical optimization My research lies at the intersection of computational mathematics and artificial intelligence. I develop algorithms that make AI models more efficient, stable, and interpretable, and I use AI to address challenging problems in numerical modeling, inference, and control. My methods are rooted in numerical algorithms for differential equations (ODEs, SDEs, PDEs) and tools from numerical analysis, high-performance computing, optimal transport, and optimal control. As a scientific computing expert working in AI, I am interested in continuous-time deep learning, treating neural networks as dynamical systems that can be analyzed and trained with established numerical methods. I am also interested in optimal-transportâbased generative models, faster optimizers that exploit problem structures such as separability, leaner architectures, and mixed-precision algorithms for training quantized networks. As an AI/ML researcher working on computational mathematics, I am interested in using neural networks to approximate value functions and transport maps, enabling high-dimensional optimal control, mean field games, and Bayesian inverse problems while incorporating structure from HJB equations and the Pontryagin Maximum Principle. I am also interested in learnable iterative solvers to accelerate challenging PDE simulators. My research is collaborative and I have experience working with national laboratories and industry partners. I am always open to new collaborations, so please feel free to reach out if you are interested in working together! Teaching I regularly teach undergraduate and graduate courses at all levels from introductory mathematics courses to special topics seminars in computer science and mathematics. My teaching bridges foundational techniques from numerical analysis, optimization, and differential equations and modern applications in artificial intelligence and other fiels. I use flipped classroom models in all my classes to provide experiential learning opportunities to students to help them become effective life-long learners.
