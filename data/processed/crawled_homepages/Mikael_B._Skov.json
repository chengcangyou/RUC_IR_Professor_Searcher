I am an associate professor in human-computer interaction at the Centre for Socio-Interactive Design, at the Department of Computer Science, Aalborg University. I primarily teach at our interaction design program, but also our computer science, software engineering, informatics programs. I primarily do research within pervasive and mobile computing, social computing, interaction design for children, and usability engineering. Upcoming and recent activities: September 1: Interaction Design @ Aalborg University launch September 23-26: MobileHCI, Toronto, Canada December 2-5: OzCHI 2015, Sydney, Australia December 13-14: CHI 2015 PC Meeting, Seoul, Korea If you are interested in working with human-computer interaction or interaction design, please feel free to contact me. Also, please refer to my student project proposals. I am serving as an associate editor for the International Journal for Child-Computer Interaction  (IJCCI) and the International Journal for Mobile Human-Computer Interaction (IJMHCI). In 2014. I am an associate chair for CHI 2015, workshops co-chair for IDC 2014. Recently, I served as an associate paper chair for the CHI 2012, CHI 2013, IDC 2013, NordiCHI 2012 and as a PC member for IDC 2012, AUI 2012, AUI 2013, and Interact 2013.
