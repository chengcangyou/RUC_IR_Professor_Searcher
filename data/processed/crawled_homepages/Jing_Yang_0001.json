I got my Bachelor's degrees in Engineering Mechanics and Computer Science from TsingHua University in 1997. I went to Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in 2000 and got my Ph.D. in Computer Science in May 2005. My advisors were Matthew O. Ward and Elke. A. Rundensteiner. I joined UNCC in 2005. My research interests include: developing general visual analytics techniques for abstract data such as multidimensional data, time-oriented data, networks and hierarchies, text documents, and trajectory data; conducting design studies for application domains such as sports, bioinformatics, finance, network security, and health; exploring basic visualization topics such as interactions, insight management, clustering based visual analytics approaches, animations, and LLM-assisted visualization.
