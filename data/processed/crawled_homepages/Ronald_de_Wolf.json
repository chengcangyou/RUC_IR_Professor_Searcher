It's not \"Wolf\", \"De Wolf\", \"DeWolf\", \"deWolf\", \"Dewolf\", \"D. Wolf\", \"de Wolff\", \"deWolfe\", \"deWoolf\", \"d'Wolf\", \"de Wlof\", \"the Wolf\") (Pronounced as \"duh Wolf\", with a short `o' as in `on'; not \"dee Woolf\") Address CWI Visiting address: Science Park 123, 1098 XG Amsterdam Postal address: P.O. Box 94079, 1090 GB Amsterdam The Netherlands Office L234 (2nd floor of the new wing of the CWI building) Telephone 020-5924078 (+31 20 5924078) E-mail rdewolf at cwidotnl I do not have any open PhD or postdoc positions at the moment, so please don't email me to ask. Open positions of others at QuSoft are listed here. Foreign students: I don't supervise summer internships unless they are by PhD students who are exceptionally well in tune with my research (which is theoretical computer science with focus on quantum algorithms and complexity; it's not physics, not cryptography, not data science, not web-design etc.), so please don't send me your generic internship applications. I am a senior researcher at the Algorithms and Complexity group of CWI (Dutch Centre for Mathematics and Computer Science) and part-time full professor at the ILLC of the University of Amsterdam. I'm also a member of QuSoft and part of the Amsterdam TCS ecosystem. I also hold a 20% position at Google research. A long time ago I was a PhD student at CWI and ILLC, and then a postdoc at UC Berkeley. My main scientific interests are quantum computing and complexity theory, though I have also dabbled in error-correcting codes, data structures, operations research, and theoretical machine learning. My CV. My publications (see also Google Scholar, arxiv, DBLP, MathSciNet). PhD thesis My lecture notes My inaugural lecture Quantum computation Quantum communication and information Locally decodable codes, private information retrieval, error-correcting data structures Other theoretical computer science Survey papers Inductive logic programming Book reviews Philosophy Courses that I have taught or otherwise have been involved in.
