I am a field member of ORIE, Center for Applied Mathematics (CAM), Statistics, ECE, and CS. I am affiliated with WCM Institute of AI for Digital Health. Prior to Cornell Tech, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Statistical Reinforcement Lab at Harvard University. I received my Ph.D. in Operations Research in 2022 from Carnegie Mellon University. I received my B.A.s in Mathematics and Economics from Smith College in 2017. My work aims to develop a robust, end-to-end framework for generating and implementing evidence-based personalized healthcare strategies that are statistically sound and practically feasible in real-world clinical settings. Our work is fundamentally motivated by the unique challenges of healthcare applications, where high-stakes decision-making, limited sample sizes, and the need for minimal yet defensible statistical assumptions demand methods that are not only rigorous but also efficient and interpretable. The pipeline begins with leveraging observational data to generate initial evidence and hypotheses using scalable causal discovery methods that are efficient under finite-samples and robust under unobserved variables. This involves designing novel causal discovery algorithms, improving the efficiency of nonparametric conditional indepndent tests, and leverge modern machine learning methods such as diffusion to handle unobserved variables. To validate these findings, we focuses on the effcient design of adaptive clinical trials (such as micro-randomized trials (MRTs) and N-of-1 trials) under practical constraints, which provide rigorous, dynamic, and individualized causal evidence. Our methodology involves two distinct strands: (1) designing approximation algorithms for constrained, simpler problems, and (2) reformulating restless bandit problems to develop algorithms with stronger finite-sample guarantees. Further, I am interested in developing efficient and robust statistical inference methods in varies settings to ensure that results are statistically sound and reproducible. This includes developing theory and tools that are valid for non-adaptively collected data, data generated through adaptive algorithms (e.g., bandits or sequential trials), and decentralized (federated) data environments. I am broadly interested in translating research into practice by collaborating directly with clinicians to tackle pressing challenges: improving heart failure care, creating interpretable clinical LLMs, and leveraging diffusion models for single-cell genomics.
