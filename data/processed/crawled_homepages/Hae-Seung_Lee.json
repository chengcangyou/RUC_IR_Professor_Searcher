Since 1984, he has been on the faculty in the  Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, where he is now Advanced Television and Signal Processing Professor of Electrical Engineering and the Director of Center for Integrated Circuits and Systems. He has acted as Consultant to Maxim Integrated, Analog Devices, Inc., and MIT Lincoln Laboratories, among others. He has also served the Technology Advisory Committee for Samsung Electronics, Cypress Semiconductor, Sensata Technologies, and Dual Aperture, Inc. He co-founded several companies including SMaL Camera Technololgies, Cambridge Analog Technologies, Omni Design Technologies, and Merlin Tech. His research interests are in the areas of analog integrated circuits with the emphasis on analog-to-digital converters in scaled CMOS technologies as well as medical electronics. Prof. Lee is a recipient of the 1988 Presidential Young Investigators’ Award, and a co-recipient ISSCC Jack Kilby Outstanding Student Paper Award in 2002 and 2006. He has served a number of technical program committees for various IEEE conferences, including the International Electron Devices Meeting, the International Solid-State Circuits Conference, the Custom Integrated Circuits Conference, and the IEEE Symposium on VLSI circuits. Prof. Lee is an inventor or a co-inventor of 57 issued U.S. patents and numerous international patents. He has published more than 150 journal and conference papers, and is a Fellow of IEEE. Save",
