Welcome to my online home. I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. My research interests span the systems area of computer science, with a focus on parallel and high-performance computing using multi-core CPUs, many-core GPUs, and clusters. We have used applications from various domains for our research including scientific simulation, training and inference of artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning (AI/ML/DL), and computer vision and medical image processing. For teaching, I teach both undergraduate and graduate courses in computer systems, covering topics such as data structures, parallel programming, computer architecture, computer systems, programming languages, and compilers. I am a member of the OpenMP Architectural Review Board (ARB) and the OpenMP language subcommittee. I also act as the director of the High Performance Computing and Systems Lab that includes four faculty in the department with research interest in high performance computing. Research My research interests cover a broad range of topics in computer science systems, focusing on parallel and high-performance computing, parallel programming models and compiler techniques, and computer architecture and systems. The primary goal of my research is to enhance performance, programmability, and power efficiency for applications and users utilizing parallel computing systems with multi-core CPUs, many-core GPUs, and clusters. Our recent research includes: 1) developing parallel programming systems (APIs, compiler and runtime systems) based on OpenMP for heterogeneous systems; 2) creating performance tools for measuring, analyzing, and visualizing the execution of parallel applications to identify performance bottlenecks; and 3) developing machine learning and deep learning algorithms for 3D medical image processing, such as image registration and segmentation. Details on research projects and publications can be found on the website of my research group of High Performance Computing Architecture and System Research.
