Previously, I spent one year as a postdoctoral researcher with the Core Data Science team at Meta (London). I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Politecnico di Milano, where I was advised by Nicola Gatti. During my Ph.D. I was a Visiting Researcher at Carnegie Mellon University, where I was working with Tuomas Sandholm. I am a member of the ELLIS Society. My research focuses on problems at the intersection of computer science, machine learning, and economics. I’m broadly interested in studying computational problems arising from strategic interactions, with a focus on online settings where learning processes and incentives are fundamentally intertwined. My research was awarded a best paper award at NeurIPS 2020. My research is supported by an ERC Starting Grant (2024) for the project PLA-STEER, and by a MUR-PRIN grant (2022).
