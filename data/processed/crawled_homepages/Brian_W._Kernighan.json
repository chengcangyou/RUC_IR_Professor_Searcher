With examples drawn from a rich variety of sources, including journalism, advertising, and politics, the book demonstrates how numbers can mislead and misrepresent. In chapters covering big numbers, units, dimensions, and more, it lays bare everything from deceptive graphs to speciously precise numbers, and shows how anyone -- using a few basic ideas and lots of shortcuts -- can easily learn to recognize common mistakes, determine whether numbers are credible, and make their own sensible estimates when needed. An essential survival guide for a world drowning in big -- and often bad -- data. Published by Princeton University Press in November, 2018. Available at Amazon.
