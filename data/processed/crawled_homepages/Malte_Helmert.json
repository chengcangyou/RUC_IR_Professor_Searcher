Automated planning is the problem of finding a course of action that allows an intelligent agent to proceed from whatever situation they find themselves in to a situation which satisfies their goals. Or, as an esteemed colleague put it much more succinctly: \"Planning is the art and practice of thinking before acting.\" Apart from planning, I am also interested in all kinds of combinatorial search and optimization problems, including constraint satisfaction and classical NP-hard graph problems. Short bio I received a diploma in computer science (comparable to M.Sc.) from the University of Freiburg in March 2001 and a Ph.D. from the same institution in June 2006. From April 2001 to May 2011, I was a member of the Research Group on the Foundations of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Freiburg, headed by Bernhard Nebel. In June 2011, I joined the University of Basel. For more information, please consult my academic CV (PDF).
