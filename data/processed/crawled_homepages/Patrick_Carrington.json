As an accessibility and human-computer interaction researcher, I explore how technology can be used to understand human ability and support empowerment, independence, and improved quality of life. My research has focused on understanding user needs and designing technology systems that enhance and leverage the full potential of users with diverse abilities. While I spend a majority of my time on assistive technologies, I am also interested in web development, user experience, and physical computing.
