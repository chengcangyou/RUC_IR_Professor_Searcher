I am head of the Department of Computer Science, a core faculty member of the Tübingen AI Center, PI in the cluster of excellence ML in Science and the CRC Robust Vision. I am also an ELLIS fellow and coordinator of the ELLIS PhD program. My research group is developing machine learning models for computer vision, natural language and robotics with applications in self-driving, VR/AR and scientific document analysis. For our research and teaching activities, visit our University of Tübingen website. You can follow me on GoogleScholar, YouTube and Bluesky. Pictures from our group activities can be found in our gallery. Mip-Splatting reconstructions of our group can be found here and here. If you like to join AVG, please carefully read our Application Guide. Our group maintains the popular Scholar Inbox paper recommender platform: Prof. Dr.-Ing.

We improve 3D Gaussian Splatting by placing Gaussians where they matter most: ConeGS adds primitives along pixel-view cones guided by image error, boosting quality with fewer Gaussians. baranowskibrt.github.io/conegs/ Likes: 13 Reposts: 3 Replies: 0 Andreas Geiger24.10.2025 Congratulations to our PhD student @takerumiyato.bsky.social for winning the Google PhD Fellowship in the category \"Machine Learning and ML Foundations\".

To solve this, we propose Civil Software Licenses. They prevent dual-use while being minimal in the restrictions they impose: civil-software-licenses.github.io Civil Software Licenses Likes: 16 Reposts: 3 Replies: 3 Andreas Geiger28.7.2025 Scholar Inbox @ ACL 25! @aclmeeting.bsky.social Likes: 9 Reposts: 0 Replies: 1 Andreas Geiger27.7.2025 Meme credit: @markusflicke.bsky.social Likes: 24 Reposts: 2 Replies: 0 Andreas Geiger24.7.2025 We are excited that Scholar Inbox is supporting ACL 2025 @aclmeeting.bsky.social with personalized conference programs this year for the first time! www.scholar-inbox.com/conference/a...
