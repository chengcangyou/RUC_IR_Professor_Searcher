My main research areas are distributed systems and databases. My research focuses on understanding, designing, and implementing distributed systems/databases that have enabled today’s large-scale applications. My research strives to fundamentally understand the boundaries of the design space and create new systems close to the boundaries.  I am honored to closely collaborate with many talented researchers. I am also co-advising a student with Wyatt Lloyd in designing a new architecture for distributed databases. I am always looking for motivated students who enjoy research.NewsCo-chairing the External Review Committee of ATC 24TPC member: ATC 24, SRDS 24, ICA3PP 24, PAPOC 24TurboDB accepted to NSDI 24.
