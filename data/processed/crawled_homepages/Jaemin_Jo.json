The ever-increasing size and complexity of data are now challenging our perceptual and cognitive abilities in daily analytics, leaving the data and models intractable without support. We believe interactive systems can address these challenges by amplifying our abilities to understand such data and models. We research Information Visualization (InfoVis), Visual Analytics, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). We are looking for senior undergraduate interns and graduate students. If you are interested in research topics such as Human-AI Interaction, Explainable High-dimensional Representation, or Human-AI Systems, please contact Prof. Jaemin Jo (jmjo@skku.edu). 우리는 인간과 데이터 및 인공지능을 연결하는 상호작용 기술을 연구합니다. 현재, 학부 연구생 및 대학원 신입생을 모집하고 있습니다. 인간-인공지능 상호작용, 해석 가능한 고차원 표현, 인간-인공지능 상호작용을 위한 시스템에 관심이 있는 학생들은 연락 바랍니다.
