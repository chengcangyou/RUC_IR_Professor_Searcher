I'm an Associate Professor at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. I received my BA in Engineering Science from the University of Oxford and my PhD in Systems and Control Engineering from the University of Cambridge. My broad research interests are in networks, optimisation, pervasive computing, and signals and systems. Currently, I am working in the following research topics: compressive sensing in wireless sensor networks, molecular communication and nano wireless sensor networks. See below for brief description and key recent papers. I've published more than 100 journal and conference articles in various research topics, you can have a look in my publication page. You can also check out my Google Scholar Citations page . Postgraduate study with me: I am always looking for good students to work with me in my research. If you are interested, please read this (link to prospective students page) before you email me. Fun stuff: My Erdos number is 5. A path is Chun Tung Chou - Bernard Hanzon - Martine Olivi - Laurent Baratchart - Vilmos Totik - Paul Erdos.
