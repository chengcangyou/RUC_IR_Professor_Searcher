If you would like to work with me, please drop me a line. I receive many applications and inquiries about open positions. While I review everything submitted, I regret that I am only able to respond if there is a suitable match.Research InterestsMy primary research interest lies in quantifying and mitigating risks in Software Engineering, with a particular focus on large-scale software systems. This includes Cloud computing systems, quantum computing systems, and systems that process and analyze Big Data. Examples of risks include:Improperly tested large databases for Big Data, leading to defect escapes and unplanned outages;Non-scalable algorithms, where identifying the root cause of system failures is too slow to prevent prolonged outages and customer dissatisfaction;Incorrect implementation of quantum algorithms, causing subtle inaccuracies in results that remain undetected until they critically impact dependent systems or workflows;Requirements creeping in late during development cycles, leading to budget overruns and schedule delays;A surge in defects rediscovered by clients, overwhelming support and maintenance teams.Our work utilizes a diverse set of tools, including data mining, machine learning (such as deep learning), simulation, information theory, blockchain, quantum computing, high-performance computing, and cloud computing. These technologies enable precise identification and effective mitigation of Software Engineering-related risks.SupportersMy work was made possible through the generous support of funding agencies, including the Alliance, NSERC, MITACS, and OCI, as well as industrial partners such as Environics Analytics, eSentire, IBM, Laipac, and Palomino.Selected AwardsRogers Cybersecure Catalyst Fellow, 2023-2024IBM Centre for Advanced Studies (CAS) Best Project of the Year, 2021IBM CAS Project Honorable Mention, 2020ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE), New Ideas and Emerging Results Distinguished Paper Award, 2020Dean's Scholarly, Research and Creative Activity Awards, 2017IBM CAS Faculty Fellow, 2014-currentWinner of the IBM Canada Big Data Tech Challenge, 2013Guinness World Record: the largest data warehouse containing 3Pb of raw data (IBM DB2 VLDB team member), 2012GroupCurrent MembersMontgomery Gole, MSc studentMohammad Saiful Islam, PhD studentWilliam Pourmajidi, PhD studentMohamed Sami Rakha, Postdoctoral fellowJanakan Siva, BEng studentAdam Sorrenti, MSc studentViral Thakar, MSc studentCatherine Xia, MSc studentLei Zhang, Assistant Professor, University of Maryland, Baltimore CountyAlumniClick to expandMSc StudentsMuad Abu-Ata, MSc (DS), Principal Data Scientist at Ingram MicroZainab Al-zanbouri, MSc (CS), Professor at Sheridan CollegeJanusan Baskararajah, MSc (CS), Software Developer at NAVBLUE, an Airbus CompanyMayy Habayeb, MEng (MIE), Professor at Centennial CollegeKristie House-Senapati, MSc (DS), Senior Analyst at Ally FinancialMohammad Saiful Islam, MSc (CS), PhD student at TMUMushahid Khan, MSc (CS), PhD student at UBCJorge Lopez, MSc (CS), PhD student at TMUSravya Polisetty, MSc (CS), Data Scientist II at VeriskWilliam Pourmajidi, MSc (CS), PhD student at TMUMefta Sadat, MSc (CS), Staff Software Engineer at Loblaw DigitalAli Senejani, MSc (DS), Data Scientist at Corus EntertainmentSarah Sohana, MSc (CS), Developer Analyst at Rogers CommunicationsIwona Sokalska, MSc (DS), PhD student at TMUSokratis Tsakiltsidis, MSc (CS), Manager Ad-Tech & Data Engineering at PelmorexPhD StudentsSedef Akinli Kocak, PhD (ENSCIMAN), Director at Vector InstituteSheik Mamun, Graduate Studies, Senior Data Architect at AWSPostdoctoral FellowsWilliams P.
