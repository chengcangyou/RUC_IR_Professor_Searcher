I received my Ph.D. in computer science from UT Austin in 2018. My research interests include programming languages, program analysis and verification, program synthesis, and security. More specifically, I want to build automated tools to guarantee the desired behavior of a system in a sound, precise and scalable way. I am also interested in applying program synthesis/analysis to build and break systems, tackling security and performance problems in mobile devices and blockchain. I am actively looking for self-motivated and talented students and postdocs. If you are interested in building cutting-edge program synthesis/analysis framework that combines the power of logical reasoning and machine learning, please drop me an email with your CV (Knowledge on constraint solving or functional programming languages will be a big plus).
