My research is focused on the design and development of Metaheuristics, and their integration and combination with Machine Learning methods, applied in several research areas, such as Optimization; Complex Networks; Computational Biology; Forecasting and Detection tasks; Groups Collective Behaviors. Since January 2023 I'm Editor-in-Chief of the young journal International Journal of Swarm Intelligence (IJSI), and currently I'm Associate Editor for the journals Soft Computing, Frontiers in Big Data and Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence, and I'm member of Editorial Boards of several international journals. I'm also member of the program committee for many important international conferences and workshops, mainly in the field of evolutionary computation. Over the years, I have acquired an extensive experience in organizing successful international conferences, and summer schools. In particular I'm currently the founder and Chief of the Scientific Directors of the Metaheuristics Summer School (MESS). Thanks to this long experience, I have established several fruitful international research collaborations over the years. Recently I has been invited as a Keynote Speaker for the international conference INTIS 2024 (12th International Conference on New Technologies, Artificial Intelligence and Smart Data), and over the years I has participated as Tutorial Speaker and/or Invited Speaker in several international conferences. I'm also editor of several special issues in renowned international journals in the field, such as International Transactions in Operational Research; Applied Soft Computing; Swarm and Evolutionary Computation; BMC Immunology; Artificial Life and Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, and I have been invited to act as reviewer for several national and international research projects, as well as external reviewer for several international PhD theses. Today I'm Scientific co-Director of the research group \"Complex Intelligent Systems\" at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science of the University of Catania.

Le successive date verranno comunicate durante le lezioni. Read More Research News 21th March 2024: I have been invited to be Plenary Speaker at the INTIS 2024 - 12th International Conference on New Technologies, Artificial Intelligence and Smart Data (30-31 May & 01 June 2024, Tangier, Morocco). My plenary talk will be entitled: \"Metaheuristics & Machine Learning: how one enhances the other\". Read More Announcements 8th March 2024: I'm proud to announce that our research work entitled \"Group Dynamics in Memory-Enhanced Ant Colonies: The Influence of Colony Division on a Maze Navigation Problem\" and accepted in Algorithms, has been selected by the editors as the cover of the volume 17 issue 2 of Algorithms!! Read More Research My research is focused on the design and development of metaheuristics and nature inspired methodologies for combinatorial optimization problems and in the research area of computational & systems biology. In particular, in these years my research works have been mainly focused on community detection in social and biological networks; integration between metaheuristics and machine learning; combinatorial optimization problems; dynamic interactions detection in social behaviours; parameters extraction in biological networks (Gene Regulatory Network in the S-system model); protein structure prediction in the HP model; and functions optimization.
