Proceedings of EACL, pp. 1228-1238. http://aclanthology.org/E17-1115 (code; slides; Q&A) Summary of Q&A (questions paraphrased, improved answers): Micheal Strube: Your model fails to characterize art! The research question mentions the goal of finding textual conventions, but literature is the polar opposite of that. What about e.g., Beckett? Characterizing capital-A Art was not the goal; the goal was merely to empirically characterize the notion of literature that readers have. Yes, it can be argued that literature inherently breaks conventions, especially over longer periods when new styles develop (but this work is on contemporary novels from a 5-year period, so this diachronic perspective is beyond the scope of this work). However, at the same time the \"literary novel\" can be said to form a genre with its own conventions, and the results of the paper agree with that hypothesis. Either way, concepts can be defined both through differences and commonalities w.r.t. non-members and members, respectively; in order for a predictive model to generalize, finding commonalities is a natural goal and arguably inherent to doing science. It would also be possible to charactize literature by its differences w.r.t. a suitably chosen, large corpus of \"conventional\" language; this would be an interesting study for future work.
