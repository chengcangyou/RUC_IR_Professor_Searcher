Previously I was a postdoctoral researcher at the DataShape group (formerly Geometrica) at Inria Sophia-Antipolis in France, where I worked on the Gudhi project, having a great time working with Prof. Jean-Daniel Boissonnat. From September 2013 till August 2015 I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Algorithms and Complexity group at the Max Planck Institute (Informatik) in Saarbrucken, Germany. Previously, I was a visitor in the StatMath group at the Indian Statistical Institute, Delhi, India. Before that, I did my Ph.D. in Theoretical Computer Science at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, India, where I was fortunate to receive the guidance of Prof. C. R. Subramanian. Research Interests My current research interests are in randomization in Computational Geometry and Topological Data Analysis. I have also worked on random structures and the probabilistic method, and a bit on combinatorics in Group and Representation theory. More information on my research can be found here. Positions Available! Under the NCN OPUS grant High-Dimensional Data Processing Using Sample Compression and Dimensionality Reduction, there are currently positions available.",
