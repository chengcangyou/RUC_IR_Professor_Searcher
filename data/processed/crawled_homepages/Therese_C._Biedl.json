University of Waterloo 200 University Ave West Waterloo, Ontario N2L 3G1, Canada Office: DC 2341 Phone: 519-888-4567 x 34721 My main research interest lies in algorithms for geometric problems, in particular in computational geometry and planar graphs. CV (PDF) (as of July 2019) I teach courses at all levels, from 1st year CS to graduate courses. Courses I taught recently include cs240 (Data Structures and Data Management), and cs466/666 (Advanced Algorithms), cs762 (Graph-theoretic algorithms). I supervise students at all levels. To apply: Undergraduate students: Check the URA web page; if no positions with me are listed then I currently have none available. Master's and PhD: You must apply through the official application web site; otherwise I will not consider your application. A direct email to me will be deleted without reply unless it includes the UW application number that is given to you when you apply at this site, and your research interest are close to mine. (Note: I do not do anything resembling AI or machine learning.) Please do not waste my time with any other emails. Postdocs and short-term visitors: Contact me by email. (Hint: If I haven't met you or your supervisor, the answer is very likely \"no\".)",
