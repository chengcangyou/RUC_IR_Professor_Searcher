Follow Prague, Czech Republic Czech Technical University Email Google Scholar ORCID PubMed Scopus I am an Associate Professor at the Czech Techncial University in Prague and a researcher in the Intelligent Data Analysis lab. My work focuses on bioinformatics, data mining and machine learning. I am part of the Department of Computer Science at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, where I also serve as Deputy Head responsible for teaching. My long-term research efforts over the past years can be divided into two main areas. First, I develop dedicated algorithms for knowledge discovery from heterogeneous molecular biology data. Together with my students, I have created methods such as network-guided random forests, semantic biclustering of gene expression data, and approaches for learning RNA interaction networks from expression data. Second, I collaborate with medical and clinical research institutes on specific projects and case studies, applying both our algorithms and state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning methods to real-world biological problems. My teaching closely aligns with the research interests outlined above. I currently act as a lecturer for graduate courses in Bioinformatics and Statistical Data Analysis. In addition, I lead a reading group on data mining and machine learning for PhD students. I am also actively involved in two of our major study programmesâOpen Informatics and Medical Electronics and Bioinformaticsâserving on their programme boards and contributing to curriculum development.",
