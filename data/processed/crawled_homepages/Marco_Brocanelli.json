I received my B.E. and M.E. degrees in Control Systems from the University of Rome Tor Vergata (Italy). I spent the last 6 months of M.E. studies at The Ohio State University (Columbus, Ohio, USA) working on my M.E. thesis under the supervision of Dr. Andrea Serrani and Dr. Luca Zaccarian. After graduation (May 2011), I kept working under the supervision of Dr. Andrea Serrani as a Visiting Scholar and then, in August 2012, I started my Ph.D. in the Power-Aware Computer Systems (PACS) Laboratory under the supervision of Dr. Xiaorui Wang. In August 2018, I received my Ph.D. degree in the Electrical and Computer Engineering program of The Ohio State University. My core research is energy-aware sustainable computing applied to a wide set of technologies, including mobile augmented reality, edge computing, mobile/edge AI, autonomous mobile robots, autonomous vehicles, and energy-harvesting sensor networks. I am also interested in studying how such cutting-edge technologies can be deployed in our society to create more inclusive communities.
