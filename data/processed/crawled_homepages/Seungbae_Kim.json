Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Communication Department at UCLA under the supervision of Professor Jungseock Joo. I got my Ph.D. degree in the Computer Science Department at UCLA and was a member of the Scalable Analytics Institute (ScAi) under the supervision of Professor Wei Wang. My research group focuses on advancing core machine learning methodologies, with particular emphasis on:Graph-based learning: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), spatio-temporal graph learning, and graph representation learning.Multimodal learning: multimodal fusion, hierarchical integration, and cross-modal alignment.Generative AI: large language models (LLMs), diffusion models, and their applications.Responsible AI: fairness in machine learning, bias mitigation, and algorithmic transparency.With these technical focuses, my research advances AI for social good and data mining for social systems, with applications in healthcare, fairness, mental health, communication, and public communication.Google SitesReport abuseGoogle SitesReport abuse",
