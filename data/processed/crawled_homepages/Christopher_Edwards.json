The network mobility work is looking at how Mobile Hosts or Mobile Networks (MN) are able to obtain quick, trouble-free, secure network access whilst they roam. The work to provide such access has been supported by a number of sources including the European Commission (the u2010 project), JANET UK (Mobile IP Trails), and perhaps most notably, Cisco Systems in their sponsorship of a number of Ph.D students at Lancaster. His general interests include future Internet protocols, multimedia communications, network support for GRID applications, quality of service and traffic engineering.
