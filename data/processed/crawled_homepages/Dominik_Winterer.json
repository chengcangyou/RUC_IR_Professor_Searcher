Personal profile OverviewOffice: Room 2.81, Kilburn BuildingEmail: [email protected]Research Interests: Software Engineering, Programming Languages, Security (more details: https://manchester-fme.github.io)BiographyI am an Assistant Professor (Lecturer) at the University of Manchester since September 2025, where I lead the Formal Methods Engineering Lab. I completed my Ph.D. and PostDoc at ETH Zurich, and before that, my MSc at the University of Freiburg in Germany. I also did research internships at the Automated Reasoning Group at AWS and at IBM Research in the United States.My research aims to establish Formal Methods Engineering—a new discipline focused on making Formal Methods, mathematically rigorous methods for bug prevention, more practical and widely adopted. As a first step, I led one of the largest academic bug-hunting campaigns to date, uncovering over 1,800 bugs and enabling more than 1,300 fixes in SMT solvers, which are foundational tools in Formal Methods.
