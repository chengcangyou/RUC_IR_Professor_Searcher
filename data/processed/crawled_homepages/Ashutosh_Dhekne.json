I am a part of Georgia Tech's Sustainability Next committee. Research projects that contribute to the 17 UN SDGs are indicated using individual SDG icons. We have made research contributions in the following areas: I am honored to be selected BBISS Faculty Fellow, 2023 - 2025 I am honored to be selected to the inaugural cohort of Energy Equity, Environmental Justice & Community Engagement Faculty Fellows, 2023 Tiny Data Several of our projects culminate into the theme of Tiny Data. At a high level, it is the idea that even a miniscule amount of data of the right kind can enable important applications. A 10-minute presentation about Tiny Data is here. A longer talk presented at BBISS seminar series is here.
