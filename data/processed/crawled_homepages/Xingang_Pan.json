Prior to joining NTU, I was a postdoc researcher at Max Planck Institute for Informatics, advised by Prof. Christian Theobalt. I received my Ph.D. degree at Multimedia Laboratory in the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2021, supervised by Prof. Xiaoou Tang. I obtained my Bachelor's degree from Tsinghua University in 2016. Our group studies fundamental and interesting problems in modeling our visual world through generative machine learning. We also explore the vast possibilities enabled by such generative world models, particularly for understanding and interacting with the physical world. We embrace curiosity-driven research. To prospective students: Application: If you are interested in joining our group at MMLab@NTU, please drop me an email at xingang.pan\\[at\\]ntu.edu.sg with your resume. Priority will be given to candidates with research experience in Embodied AI, then Generative AI. Due to the volume of emails received, we regret that only shortlisted candidates will be contacted. Thanks for your understanding. News [2025] We have 2 papers in ICLR 2025, 4 papers in CVPR 2025 with one oral, 4 papers in ICCV 2025, 2 papers in SIGGRAPH Asia 2025, and 1 paper in NeurIPS 2025. [2025] I will serve as an Area Chair for ICLR 2026. [2025] I start to serve as an Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), and IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG). [2025] Yushi Lan and Yongwei Chen are awarded the Meshy AI Fellowship and the Meshy AI Fellowship Finalist respectively. [2025] We co-organized the 3DV 2025 Area Chair Workshop. [2025] Invited talk at the 3DV 2025 Area Chair Workshop. [2024] Awarded the prestigious Singapore NRF Fellowship funded by the National Research Foundation of Singapore. [2024] Awarded the Nanyang Assistant Professorship (NAP). [2024] I serve as an Area Chair for CVPR 2024~25, 3DV 2024~2025. Selected Publications Google Scholar and Full List.
