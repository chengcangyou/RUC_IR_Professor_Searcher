Mapping Transciption Factor Networks We develop efficient methods for determining which transcription factors can bind and regulate each gene in a genome. Modeling Dynamic Transciption Factor Networks We develop efficient algorithms for predictive modeling of transcriptional profiles as a function of the activity levels of transcription factors. Transcriptome Engineering We develop algorithms for designing modifications to a transcription factor network that will drive the cell into a transcriptional state associated with a desired behavior. Understanding the relationship between binding and regulation We are working to understand why some genes that are bound by a transcription factor are functionally regulated by that factor while others are not. Capsule Regulation and Virulence in Cryptococcus Neoformans We use a powerful combination of molecular and computational techniques to reconstruct the regulatory network that controls C. neoformans capsule synthesis - in order to target this process in antifungal therapy.
