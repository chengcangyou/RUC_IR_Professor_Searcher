Involve me and I learn.\" ---Benjamin Franklin \"Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution.\" ---Albert Einstein \"THESIS: Never let ideology or \"good taste\" stop you from proving a good theorem?\" ---Saharon Shelah in The Future of Set Theory \"I love to do research, I want to do research, I have to do research, and I hate to sit down and begin to do research---I always try to put it off just as long as I can. ....Isn't there something I can (must?) do first? Shouldn't I sharpen my pencils perhaps?\" ---Paul Halmos, I Want to be a Mathematician If you keep proving stuff that others have done, getting confidence, increasing the complexities of your solutions - for the fun of it - then one day you'll turn around and discover that nobody actually did that one! And that's the way to become a computer scientist. --Richard Feynman, Feynman Lectures on Computation Primary research interests Computer Architecture, Fault Tolerance, Hardware and Software Implementation of Complex Algorithms.
