My long-term objective is the creation of useful distributed computing systems. The first step towards this objective was design, implementation and experimentation with high-performance network subsystems, primarily in the AURORA Gigabit Testbed project. The second step was giving distributed applications more control over their network systems, primarily in the Protocol Boosters and SwitchWare projects. The third and current step, is using cognitive systems approaches to automate configuration and adaptation to the environment, particularly for mobile systems. \"For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for Nature cannot be fooled.\" -R.
