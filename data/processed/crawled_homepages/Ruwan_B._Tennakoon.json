He earned his BSc (Hons) in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the University of Peradeniya and completed his PhD in Computer Vision at Swinburne University of Technology in 2015. Following his PhD, he undertook post-doctoral fellowships at the RMIT School of Engineering and IBM Research. Ruwan’s research focuses on robust computer vision, with applications in medical imaging and industrial automation. His early work focused on developing robust algorithms for low-level vision tasks. More recently, he has been addressing the challenges of distribution shift in vision systems, with a particular interest in understanding large vision foundation models.
