Maic Masuch did his doctorate on computeranimation at the University of Magdeburg and in 2002 he has been offered the first professorship for computer games in Germany there. He does research and teaches on topics of game development over 10 years and is one of the pioneers of computer game research in Germany. After a short stay at the Duke University in North Carolina, USA, he worked as professor for digital learning games at FH Trier from 2007 to 2008.Main Research AreasThe research at the professorship focusses on a subdomain of Media and Computer Science, which is called Entertainment Computing in the fields of Game design and game development from Computer Science’s point of view The connection among games and learning In this context we are especially dealing with the following aspects: Interaction Design 3D Stereo Authoring systems for media environment User experience Design/Game experience Interactive Storytelling Media environment for children Media systems for special target groups such as children or elderly people or games in non-playful contexts such as Gameful Interaction for operational applications and obviously Edutainment environments like Serious Games, act as application fields for our research.Teaching 10/2008 - today Professor für Medieninformatik | Entertainment Computing an der Fakultät für Informatik, Abteilung für Human-centered Computing und Cognitive Science (HCCS) an der Universität Duisburg-Essen 10/2007 - 09/2008 Professor für Digitale Lernspiele an der Fachhochschule (FH) Trier 04/2007 - 09/2007 Gastprofessur an der Duke University, North Carolina, USA 12/2002 - 04/2007 Juniorprofessor für Grafische und Interaktive Methoden für Computerspiele an der Otto-von-Guericke-Universität Magdeburg Other Activities Mitgliedschaften: GI (Gesellschaft für Informatik); DIGRA (Digital Games Research Association); Programmkomitee der Konferenzen: International Conference on Entertainment Computing, Digital Games Research Association, Foundation of Digital Games, Advances in Computer Entertainment, International Conference on Virtual Storytelling, Conference on Creating, Programmkomitee Connecting and Collaborating through Computing u.a.
