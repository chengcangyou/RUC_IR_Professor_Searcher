Subject Data represent the world on our computers. While the world is very intriguing, data may be quite boring, if one does not know what they mean. I am interested in making data more meaningful to find interesting insights in the world outside. How does meaning arise? One can model data and information. Conceptual models and ontologies are the foundations for knowledge graphs that enable the computer to treat data in a meaningful way. Other foundations are physical principles that are put to use in simulations in order reveal laws that govern data. Using machine learning, text and data mining as well as information extraction one may find meaningful patterns in data as well as connections between data and its use in context. Humans communicate information. In order to understand what data and information means, one has to understand social interactions and interactions with computers. Eventually meaning is nothing that exists in the void. Data and information must be communicated to people who may use insights into data and information. Interaction between humans and computers must happen in a way that matches the meaning of data and information. Internships We do not offer any kind of internship to bachelor or master students. Ph.D. students are welcome to inquire about research visits. Publications DBLP bibliography Steffen Staab Google Scholar page for Steffen Staab Publications Publications: 103.

While automatic captions provide some accessibility, they often contain errors in grammar, homophones, and domain-specific terminology, making comprehension challenging. CaptionCrowd enables users to collaboratively identify and correct inaccurate captions in real-time, improving their quality through community-driven feedback.The platform features a user-friendly web-based video player that allows users to highlight incorrect words in subtitles, with their selections recorded for further analysis. User testing with 16 participants revealed that manually correcting captions can be cognitively demanding, highlighting the ongoing need for enhanced accessibility solutions. }, affiliation = {Fathallah, Nadeen/University of Stuttgart, Staab, Steffen/University of Stuttgart}, author = {Fathallah, Nadeen and Staab, Steffen}, doi = {10.18419/darus-4775}, howpublished = {Software}, orcid-numbers = {Fathallah, Nadeen/https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7921-034X, Staab, Steffen/https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0780-4154}, title = {Code for Caption Crowd (IKILeUS) : A Collaborative Platform for Improving Automated Captions Through User Feedback}, year = 2025 }101.

BibTeXBibTeX@misc{fathallah2025echotables, abstract = {EchoTables is an innovative accessibility tool developed as part of the IKILeUS project at the University of Stuttgart. It is designed to improve the usability of tabular data for visually impaired users by converting structured tables into concise, auditory-friendly textual summaries. Traditional screen readers navigate tables linearly, which imposes a high cognitive load on users. EchoTables alleviates this issue by summarizing tables, facilitating quicker comprehension and more efficient information retrieval.Initially utilizing RUCAIBox (LLM), EchoTables transitioned to Mistral-7B, a more powerful open-source model, to enhance processing efficiency and scalability. The tool has been tested with widely used screen readers such as VoiceOver to ensure accessibility. EchoTables has been adapted to process diverse data sources, including lecture materials, assignments, and WikiTables, making it a valuable resource for students navigating complex datasets. }, affiliation = {Fathallah, Nadeen/University of Stuttgart, Staab, Steffen/University of Stuttgart}, author = {Fathallah, Nadeen and Staab, Steffen}, doi = {10.18419/darus-4774}, howpublished = {Software}, orcid-numbers = {Fathallah, Nadeen/https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7921-034X, Staab, Steffen/https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0780-4154}, title = {Code for EchoTables (IKILeUS) : AI-powered tool for enhancing accessibility of tabular data for visually impaired users}, year = 2025 }100.

Structural Graph.ttl: Encodes structural elements and their relationships, including support systems and load-bearing components, structured for semantic querying. Neutral Building Model (Architectural + Structural).ttl: A consolidated RDF representation integrating architectural and structural elements. All proprietary references (e.g., BHoM) have been removed to ensure vendor neutrality and interoperability. Architectural columns are linked to structural bars, and architectural floors to structural panels. The model is fully queryable using SPARQL and adheres to open-access, GD",
