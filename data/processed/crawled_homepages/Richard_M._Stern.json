You can obtain most of my contact information from my official ECE Department faculty web page. Typically the best way to reach me quickly is via email to rms@cs.cmu.edu Most of my research at CMU has been concerned with robust speech recognition and related technologies, and with binaural hearing. You can get more information about both of these programs, including .pdf files of most of the relevant papers we have published in these areas. More biographical information about me can be obtained from either my standard short bio or from my complete resume (mostly up to date).",
