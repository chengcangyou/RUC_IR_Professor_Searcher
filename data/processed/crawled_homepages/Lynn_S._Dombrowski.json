She studies designs and prototypes human-centered computing technologies for intervening in large systemic social issues like social and economic inequalities (e.g., hunger; wage violations). Her work contributes to the fields of human-computer interaction, ubiquitous and social computing, and design. Her goal is to understand the limitations and strengths of applying design methods to contemporary social issues. Such work produces analytic, theoretic, and pragmatic contributions within HCI to deepen the field’s understanding of how information and communication technologies may foster and inhibit social change. Given these interests and commitments, she explores themes of power, empowerment, politics, ethics, values, advocacy, and social justice within the context of the design and use of sociotechnical systems.
