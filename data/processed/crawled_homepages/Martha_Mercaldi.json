She is currently the chair of the Computer Engineering Program. Kim leads the ARCADE Lab where she conducts research in computer architecture, parallel programming, compilers, and low-power computing. Her work has explored low-cost chip manufacturing systems, reconfigurable communication networks, and fine-grained parallel application profiling techniques. Her current research focuses on hardware and software techniques to improve the usability of hardware accelerators as well as data-centric accelerator design. Kim holds a PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Washington and a bachelors in Computer Science from Harvard University. She is the recipient of the 2013 Rodriguez Family Award, the 2015 Edward and Carole Kim Faculty Involvement Award, a 2013 NSF CAREER award, and the 2016 Anita Borg Early Career Award.
