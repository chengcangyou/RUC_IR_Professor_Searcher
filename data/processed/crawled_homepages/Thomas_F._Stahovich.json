We are part of the Mechanical Engineering Department, in the Bourns College of Engineering, at the University of California, Riverside. We conduct research in the development of intelligent design software. For example, we have developed systems that can learn to solve design problems by observing solutions created by a human designer. We also conduct research in natural user interfaces. Here, our work is focused on enabling computers to understand natural forms of human communication, primarily sketching, but also speech and gesture. The aim of this work is to we create computational techniques and user interface design principles to enable natural, pen-based software for a variety of applications, such as engineering and education.
