Students Teaching Press News Contact For most up-to-date information please visit my group's page People-Aware Computing and follow us at @pac_cornell I direct the People Aware Computing group which develops mobile sensing systems for understanding life patterns of individuals, groups, and societies. A key mission for us is to change the way mental health is diagnosed and treated by creating novel wearable and mobile system that continuously track mental wellbeing. I am a co-founder of HealthRhythms that aims to bring novel technological solutions to facilitate mental wellbeing. I received my Ph.D. degree from the Media Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). As part of my doctoral work, I created the sociometer and conducted the first experiment that uses mobile sensors to model social networks, which led to a new field of research referred to as Reality Mining. I hold a B.S. in electrical engineering from the University of Rochester, and M.S. from the MIT Media Laboratory.
