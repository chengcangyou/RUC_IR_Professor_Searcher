I'm also an Associate Director of the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts (IC3) and a board member of the Zcash Foundation. I received my Ph.D. from the University of Maryland Cybersecurity Center. Director of the Decentralized Systems Lab at UIUC! My research interests are broadly in computer security, and focused on the design of secure decentralized systems and cryptocurrencies. I combine techniques from programming languages, cryptography, and distributed computing.
