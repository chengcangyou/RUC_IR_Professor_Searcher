  "content": "About me I am the Associate Director for Graduate Programs in the School of Informatics, Computing, and Cyber Systems at Northern Arizona University. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of São Paulo in 2015 and was a visiting scholar at the University of California, Irvine (2013-2014). My research bridges Software Engineering and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, with a focus on human aspects of software development. I study how to better support newcomers in Open Source Software communities and how emerging technologies—especially foundational models—are reshaping education and software development. More broadly, my work spans empirical software engineering, OSS sustainability, and mining software repositories. I have served the community in multiple leadership roles, including General Chair of MSR 2026, ICSME 2024 and ICPC 2024, Area Chair for Human Aspects at ICSE 2025, and PC Co-Chair of SBES 2024. In recent years, I also chaired CHASE 2023, ICSSP/ICGSE 2022, OSS 2022, and several other international venues. I was part of several PCs, including ICSE, ICSE-NIER, MSR, CSCW, ICGSE, OSS, and EASE. I am an active reviewer for top conferences and journals and serve on the editorial boards of Empirical Software Engineering and the Journal of Software: Evolution and Practice.
