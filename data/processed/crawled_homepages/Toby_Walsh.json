He is a Laureate Fellow and Scientia Professor of Artificial Intelligence in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at UNSW Sydney, and he is also an adjunct fellow at CSIRO Data61. \t\t He was named by the Australian newspaper as a \"rock star\" of Australia's digital revolution. He has been elected a fellow of the Australian Academy of Science, a fellow of the ACM, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and of the European Association for Artificial Intelligence. He has won the prestigious Humboldt Prize as well as the NSW Premier's Prize for Excellence in Engineering and ICT, and the ACP Research Excellence award. He has previously held research positions in England, Scotland, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland and Sweden. He has played a leading role at the UN and elsewhere on the campaign to ban lethal autonomous weapons (aka \"killer robots\"). His advocacy in this area has led to him being \"banned indefinitely\" from Russia. Toby Walsh regularly appears in the media talking about the impact of AI and robotics on society. He is passionate that limits are placed on AI to ensure the public good such as with autonomous weapons. He has appeared on TV and radio stations on the ABC, BBC, Channel 7, Channel 9, Channel 10, CCTV, CNN, DW, NPR, RT, SBS, and VOA, as well as on numerous other radio stations and podcasts (a recent showreel). He also writes frequently for print and online media. His work has appeared in the New Scientist, American Scientist, Le Scienze, Cosmos, Technology Review, the New York Times, the Guardian, the Conversation and \"The Best Writing in Mathematics\". His twitter account has been voted one of the top ten to follow to keep abreast of developments in AI. He has given talks at public and trade events like CeBIT, the World Knowledge Forum, TEDx, New Scientist Live and writers festivals in Adelaide, Bendigo, Bhutan, Brisbane, Canberra, Geelong, Jaipur, Margaret River, Melbourne, Mumbai, Nagpur, Pune, Sydney and elsewhere. He has been profiled by the New York Times and the Brilliant, but was even more surprised (spelt embarrassed) to have an IMBD entry and to have been made the cover story of his old school magazine. You can listen to a recent interview from ABC Radio National. . research Artificial Intelligence My research focuses on AI. I am particularly interested in building trustworthy AI. This decomposes into a number of technical challenges such as fairness, transparency, explainability, privacy and robustness. Trust has other dimensions besides the technical such as the social and political. I therefore engage with the public and politicians in exploring how we can build trust in technologies like AI. My technical research has focused recently on AI problems for social good such as organ matching. Google Scholar lists me at #1 in the world for computational social choice, for constraints and for satisfiability, and in top 10 for optimisation and top 50 for AI. In the policy space, I was Chair of the learned academies expert group advising the government on AI, and contributed to Australia's ethical framework for AI. I have worked with Government departments such as Education, Industry and the Attorney General's office, and bodies such as the Human Rights Commission to ensure the impact of AI is beneficial. I have been a leading voice in the debate around autonomous weapons and have spoken at the UN and to governments around the world about this issue. Public understanding As AI is starting to make real progress, there is a large appetite from the public to understand where it might be taking us. I therefore spend an increasing amount of my time thinking about the future of AI and speaking to the media, politicians, and the public about where we are today and where AI can take us in the future.
