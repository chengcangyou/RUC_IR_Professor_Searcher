My research interest is computer networks, operating systems and security. My best known work is identifying TCP extensibility against middlebox interference (IMC'11) and building the first TCP/IP network stack for persistent memory (NSDI'18). Current projects include secure transport protocol design for the cloud, efficient yet flexible load balancing, and host networking and storage stack co-design.
