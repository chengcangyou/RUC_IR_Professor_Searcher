Our main focus lies on NP-hard problems. In general, these problems have no efficient algorithms but many real-world instances can be usually solved quite efficiently. Typical problems considered in our research arise in different areas of data science such as Network analysis (graph clustering, community detection) Computational biology (string algorithms, phylogenetics) Machine learning (decision trees, Bayesian networks) Team Teaching Publications News Research 11 November 2025 Three Accepted Papers First Paper Acceptances for 2026 3 February 2025 PhD defense Jannik Schestag successfully defends his PhD thesis. 3 February 2025 Paper accepted at AAAI'25 The paper uses algorithm engineering to improve a decision tree algorithm.
