Some of our recent works are on multi-modal machine learning (including deep learning) models applied to better understanding complex diseases, informing targeted therapies, improving patient outcomes, and reducing bias and disparity in health care. The common theme of these works aims at building AI/ML models that improve both prediction accuracy and interpretability (stronger requirement than explainability), by exploring relational information in each data modality.
