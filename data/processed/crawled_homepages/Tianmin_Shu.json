I also hold a joint appointment with the Deparment of Cognitive Science. My research goal is to advance human-centered AI by engineering machine social intelligence to build socially intelligent systems that can understand, reason about, and interact with humans in real-world settings. I approach this from an interdisciplinary perspective, connecting machine learning, computer vision, robotics, and social cognition to study machine social intelligence. Before joining JHU, I was a Research Scientist at MIT working with Josh Tenenbaum and Antonio Torralba.
