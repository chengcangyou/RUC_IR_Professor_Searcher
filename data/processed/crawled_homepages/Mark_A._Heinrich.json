Bio I am currently an Associate Professor in Computer Science at UCF. After the creation of the School of EECS in 2005, I served as its Associate Director from 2005-2007. Before the merge I was Director of the School of Computer Science from April to September, 2005. I came to UCF as an Associate Professor in January, 2003.  Prior to that, I was an Assistant Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University, a co-founder of its Computer Systems Laboratory, and a member of the Intelligent Information Systems Institute.  I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University under John Hennessy in 1998 where I was a principal designer of the FLASH multiprocessor; the author of FlashLite, the system-level simulator of the FLASH machine; and the designer of four cache coherence protocols for FLASH (bitvector/coarsevector, dynamic pointer allocation, SCI, and a simple two-bit protocol. I received my Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Duke University in 1991. I was co-founder and CTO of Phanfare, Inc., an archival photo and video hosting service, now part of Carbonite. I was also the co-founder and Chief Architect of Flashbase, Inc. an Internet company specializing in automated sweepstakes and database-backed forms and tools for customer acquisition. Flashbase was acquired by DoubleClick in 2000. Oh, I am a HUGE sports fan. I am also a huge history buff and have visited the grave of every US President.
