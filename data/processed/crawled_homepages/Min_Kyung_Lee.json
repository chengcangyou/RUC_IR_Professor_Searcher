We organized a workshop on Human-AI Alignment: Developing a Research Agenda by Bridging Interdisciplinary Approaches at the TAS conference! Our PhD student, Angie Zhang, ran a co-design workshop as part of the worker training on AI, which was organized by International Labour Organization. I am an assistant professor in the UT Austin School of Information, and a director of the Human-AI Interaction Lab. I am also core faculty of the campus-wide Ethical AI Program, and affiliated with Machine Learning Lab, Good Systems, and Texas Robotics. Our work is possible thanks to the National Science Foundation, Good Systems, and Swedish Research Council. I am a human-computer interaction researcher who combines computer science, design, and social science theories and methods. I conducted some of the first studies that empiricially examine the AI's social implications on work, management, and governance. I coined the term Algorithmic Management, and proposed the Procedural Justice Framework for AI to address the misalignment between AI assumptions and stakeholder priorities. My vision is that Participatory AI, which enables stakeholder participation across the AI development cycle, can better align AI with stakeholder priorities and contribute to creating just, empowering workplaces and cities. I strive to translate my research into pragmatic systems and processes to make the real-world impact or support organizations that promote equity and social good. Our WeBuildAI participatory algorithm is adopted by Food Rescue Hero; we are conducting research to assist public administration using technology. Some of our current partners include Austin Transportation Department, King County, Washington, Food Rescue Hero, and Dilligent Robotics. Bio CV Google Scholar (11,168 citations)    👋 Join our lab!
