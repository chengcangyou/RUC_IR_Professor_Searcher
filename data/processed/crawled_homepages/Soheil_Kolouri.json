Follow Nashville, TN Email ResearchGate LinkedIn Github Google Scholar ORCIDI am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN, where I lead the Machine Intelligence and Neural Technologies (MINT) Lab. My research interests span applied mathematics, machine learning, and computer vision, with a particular focus on computational optimal transport and geometry. Before joining Vanderbilt, I was a research scientist and principal investigator at HRL Laboratories in Malibu, CA, where I served as the PI on the DARPA Learning with Less Labels (LwLL) program and Co-PI on the DARPA Lifelong Learning Machines (L2M) program. I received my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, where I was honored with the Bertucci Fellowship Award from the College of Engineering in 2014 and the Outstanding Dissertation Award from the Biomedical Engineering Department in 2015. My work has resulted in over 75 publications in top machine learning and signal processing venues, more than 25 issued patents, an NSF CAREER Award, and a Best Paper Award at ICASSP 2022.[Open Positions] I am recruiting motivated PhD students with strong mathematical background to work with me on topics aligned with my lab's 'research directions'. Master’s and undergraduate students within Vanderbilt University and visiting scholars are always welcome.
