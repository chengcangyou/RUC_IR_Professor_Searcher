He is the Director of the Graphics, Artificial Intelligence, Design, & Games (GAIDG) Lab and a Research Fellow at the Institute on Aging and Lifelong Health at the University of Victoria. Brandon received the B.Sc. Honours degree in Computer Science from York University in 2013, M.Sc. in 2016, and Ph.D. in 2019, and was a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the Ontario Research Fund/Intelligent Systems for Sustainable Urban Mobility (ORF/ISSUM) project in 2019/2020. His past research concerned the development and gamification of interactive motor speech rehabilitation for people with neurodegenerative diseases. Brandon works within the broad areas of Graphics, Gaming, Simulation, Artificial Intelligence, and Human-Computer Interaction.  He was awarded the Cowie Faculty Innovation Award by the University of Victoria in 2022. He is a Member of the ACM, an Associate Editor of the Computer Animation and Virtual Worlds journal, and the Editor-in-chief of the Canadian Human-Computer Communications Society (CHCCS) / Société canadienne du dialogue humain-machine.
