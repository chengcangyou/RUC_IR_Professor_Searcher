Specifically, my current focus is on traditional and approximate query processing and query optimization, database on modern hardware, transaction processing, indexing and storage. Prior to joining UB, I graduated with a PhD degree in computer science from the School of Computing at University of Utah in 2021. My PhD advisors were Prof. Feifei Li and Prof. Jeff Phillips. I hold a Bachelor's degree from the ACM Class of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. In Fall 2015, I worked as a research assistant at Hong Kong Polytechnic University and was supervised by Prof. Eric Lo. My undergraduate research advisor at SJTU was Prof. Kenny Zhu. I was supported by the Google PhD Fellowship from Fall 2019 to Spring 2021.
