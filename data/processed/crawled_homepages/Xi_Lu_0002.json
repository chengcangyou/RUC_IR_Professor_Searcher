March, 2025 Four CHI 2025 papers are officially accepted. Jan, 2025 My proposal is selected by the UB Community Health Equity Pilot Studies Program (PI, $75,000). June, 2024 I graduated and will become a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor at UB. ​ My research lies at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Personal Health Informatics, and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). My research explores how data-driven ecosystems can support complex and often-changing health needs from individual, interpersonal, and socio-cultural levels. I am particularly interested in stigmatized health domains where individuals may be marginalized by the healthcare system and technology industry, such as women’s health and public health crises.I am a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor in Information Science, with a joint appointment in Computer Science and Engineering, at the University at Buffalo--SUNY. ​ I received my Ph.D. in Informatics at the University of California, Irvine, advised by Professor Daniel Epstein in the PIE lab. Before coming to UCI, I received my master's degree in HCI/design from Indiana University Bloomington, working with Professor Jeffrey Bardzell and Shaowen Bardzell. ​ ​bottom of page",
