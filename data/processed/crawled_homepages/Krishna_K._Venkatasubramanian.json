Research Interests I direct the Accessible and Socially Aware Technologies (ASSET) lab in the Department of Computer Science and Statistics. My work is situated at the intersection of accessibility, human-computer interaction, and machine learning applied to understand and meet the needs of marginalized populations. My current research would not be possible without collaboration with these excellent institutions/groups: URI Engineering, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Fenway Institute, University of Massachusetts Medical School (Emergency Medicine), Massachusetts Disabled Persons Protection Commission (DPPC), and Massacusetts Department of Developmental Services (DDS). My CV, Google Scholar, DBLP, and Publications links. Teaching I teach/have taught undergraduate courses in Data Structures/Algorithms, Human-Computer Interaction, Social Implications of Computing, Computer Networks, Software Security, Systems Programming, and graduate courses in Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Networks, and Cyber-Physical Systems. News June 2025: Our paper âToward a taxonomy of negative outcomes from the use of AI-driven systems for people with disabilities,â has been accepted at ACM ASSETS 2025!! April 2025: Liam Cannon successfully defended his MS thesis on designing Bodhi: a post-trauma self-regulation app for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Congrats, Liam!!
