Jennings Professor of Computing Sciences in the Department of Computer and Data Sciences at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU). I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Purdue University, and my B.S. and M.S. degrees from Bilkent University, respectively in Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering. My research is on the development of algorithms for large-scale data mining and analysis, with particular emphasis on networks and graph-structured data. I mainly focus on biology as the application area, and develop algorithms for analyzing biological networks and gaining insights into the systems biology of complex diseases. I also serve in the steering committee of CWRU's graduate programs in Systems Biology and Bioinformatics (SYBB) and I am an associate editor for IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (TCBB).
