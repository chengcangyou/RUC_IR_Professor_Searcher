My main research areas are as follows:Foundations of data science: I develop practical data science algorithms with provable guarantees. I am particularly interested in scalable algorithms that exploit properties of real-world data.Social network analysis: I study how interventions, such as timeline algorithms, influence the polarization and the disagreement in (online) social networks.Previously, I was a WASP assistant professor at KTH Royal Institute of Technology and a post-doc with Aris Gionis. I received my Ph.D. from the University of Vienna, advised by Monika Henzinger.
