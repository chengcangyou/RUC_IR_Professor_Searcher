I am a Teaching Professor and the Vice Chair for Undergraduate Education in the Computer Science and Engineering Department. At UC San Diego, I primarily teach discrete math for CS and introduction to computability, as well as the TA training classes. My research interests are in Automata Theory and Computability education, along with SoTL and projects that support professionalization pathways for students, including industry internships, professional development of peer mentors and teachers, and ethics and communication.

I teach a companion class for CSE majors taking industry internships. In this class, students work to identify and deepen the connections between their UCSD studies and real-world problems presented in off-campus internships. Students reflect on the growth of their professional, problem-solving, and technical skills over the internship, as well as the ethical and societal impact of their work. At the culmination of this course, students present posters at the Summer Internship Symposium early in the Fall Quarter. The Symposium celebrates our students' accomplishments and strengthens the ties between the CSE department and our alumni and industry colleagues. The Summer Internship Symposium was featured in the UCTV CSE Channel https://youtu.be/wYV-ixiwE6E. I also teach the professional development classes taken by all first-time CSE tutors and all first-time CSE teaching assistants. This hands-on class builds on educational literature and gives many opportunities for role playing, skill building, and feedback.

Grading: Adaptive rubrics and oral exams Grading serves an important pedagogical role, both in giving feedback to students to support their learning and in certifying this learning. Effective and efficient grading at scale presents multiple challenges. The adaptive rubrics project is joint work with Marco Carmosino, proposing a new framework for grading based on exploratory data analysis to mine insights on population statistics of learning outcome achievements across the class, along with efficient and consistent grading at scale. Drawing lessons from emergency remote instructions, colleagues and I explored oral exams as a modality for authentic, integrous evaluation of student learning. Across multiple projects, we explored different instantiations of oral exams, designing for scale, student sense of belonging, and academic integrity.
