I'm also a Lilly Teaching Fellow. My main research area is computer vision--understanding our world using visual data with the help of state-of-the-art deep learning models. In particular, I'm passionate about understanding people in diverse and complex environment using images and videos. I believe A.I. can and should be developed to improve people's quality of life. I am actively collaborating with researchers across disciplines to apply A.I. in scientific discovery, healthcare advancement, and societal challenges, aiming to create meaningful impact beyond traditional computer vision applications.
