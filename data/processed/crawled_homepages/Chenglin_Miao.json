If you are interested in working with me, feel free to send me your CV. Graduate admission information can be found here. Biography I am currently an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at Iowa State University. Prior to joining Iowa State, I was an assistant professor of Computer Science at the University of Georgia from 2020 to 2022. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the State University of New York at Buffalo, where I was supervised by Prof. Lu Su. My research interests include the Internet of Things, cyber-physical systems, security and privacy, and machine learning. My current work primarily focuses on designing and deploying trustworthy AI techniques for mobile, embedded, and networked systems.
