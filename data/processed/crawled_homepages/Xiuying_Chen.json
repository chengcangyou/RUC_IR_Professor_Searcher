Within this overarching theme, she specializes in issues related to robustness, faithfulness, and explainability. She is also interested in text generation for high-stakes domain applications, particularly in the scientific, medical and social fields. Email Share Prior to joining MBZUAI, Professor Chen completed her Ph.D. (2024) at KAUST in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. She has relatively rich industrial experience obtained through research internships, including at the Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence (2019), Xiaomi (2020), Microsoft (2022), and multiple collaborations with NIH, Alibaba, Ant Group, and Tencent. She received several awards during her studies, including the National Scholarship three times, the Hornbill Elite Programme, the Dean's List Award, the Scientific Research Award, and the SIGIR Travel Grant. Xiuying regularly serves as an AE or program committee member for leading NLP journals and conferences, including ACL, EMNLP, SIGIR, WWW, ICML, and NeurIPS.
