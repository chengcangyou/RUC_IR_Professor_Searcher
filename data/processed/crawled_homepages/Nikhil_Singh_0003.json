My research broadly centers on applied machine learning and human-computer interaction with applications to creativity (e.g. composition, ideation, writing, generative models), perception (e.g. multimodality, representation learning), and behavior (e.g. agents, decision-making). These areas converge on the goal of creating AI systems that meaningfully augment human capabilities.Before this, I recently finished my PhD at MIT. I'm also a musician and composer; I received my BM from the Berklee College of Music in 2017 (studying classical music composition, jazz, and computer music), where I was later an instructor. I continue to explore the relationship between music, sound, and AI in my research and am affiliated with the Digital Arts program at Dartmouth.News2025• Jan 22: Two papers accepted to ICLR 2025! 🎉• Jan 01: Joined Dartmouth College as Assistant Professor.",
