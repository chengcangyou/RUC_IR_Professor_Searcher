Biography Bo An is a President's Chair Professor and Head of Division of Artificial Intelligence at the College of Computing and Data Science of the Nanyang Technological University (NTU). He is also Director for Centre of AI-for-X of NTU. He was a Nanyang Assistant Professor during 2014-2018. Prior to join NTU in 2013, he spent one year as an Associate Professor at the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. During October 2010 to June 2012, he was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Southern California, working with Professor Milind Tambe. He received the Ph.D degree in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, where he was advised by Professor Victor Lesser. Prior to that, he received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Computer Science from Chongqing University, China. His research interests include artificial intelligence, multi-agent systems, computational game theory, reinforcement learning, automated negotiation, and optimization. He has published over 150 referred papers at top conferences (AAMAS, IJCAI, AAAI, ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, KDD, ICAPS, EC, UAI, AISTATS, and WWW) and journals (JAAMAS, AIJ and ACM/IEEE Transactions). His research results in complex resource allocation have been applied to e-commerce, sensor networks, distributed streaming processing systems, and cloud computing. His work on applying game theory to security has been applied to develop game-theoretic randomization software that is currently deployed by the United States Federal Air Marshals Service, the United States Coast Guard, and wildlife conservation organizations. He has served as program committee members for many top conferences and was co-chair for some key international conferences/symposia.
