I'm also a Visiting Faculty Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL). I lead the Innovative Data Technologies Laboratory (IDT Lab) at OSU. Prior to joining OSU, I was a Senior Scientist in the Scientific Data Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL). Before joining Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Nov 2010, I was a researcher at NEC Labs America, where I was a part of the Computer Systems Architecture Department (now Integrated Systems) and was involved in the Heterogeneous Cluster Computing project. Even before that, I was a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). I was also a Guest Researcher at the Math. and Computer Science division of Argonne National Laboratory and a Faculty Member of the Scalable Computing Software Laboratory at IIT. I received my Masters and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago. You can contact me at byna〈DOT〉1〈AT〉osu〈DOT〉edu. Research Interests My research interests span across many topics in scientific data management and analysis. These topics include parallel I/O, parallel file systems, next-generation data management systems, I/O libraries, file formats, data compression strategies, data movement performance characterization and tuning, performance data visualization, efficient scientific workflows, scientific metadata and provenance management strategies, energy-aware computing, and heterogeneous computing. I was the PI of the USA's Exascale Computing Project (ECP)-funded ExaIO project. I'm also the PI of ASCR funded object-centric data management systems for next-generation HPC and cloud systems (Proactive Data Containers - PDC) and experimental and observational data management (EOD-HDF5) projects. Software libraries developed in my teams are in the HPC-IO GitHub Organization.
