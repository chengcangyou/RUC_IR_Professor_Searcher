His research involves building statistical models of dynamic neurophysiological systems in order to explain complex processes including cognitive, developmental, and psychological changes. One avenue of research uses traditional contact sensors, including modern wearable devices, to collect signals in the laboratory and in the field from human subjects. A second avenue of research is focused on developing novel, noncontact sensors to extend the research into new environments such as the classroom or the home.As part of the Kinsey Institute Traumatic Stress Research Consortium, Dr. Lewis will be applying the methods and sensors developed at ISE to enable the Consortium's efforts to quantify the interaction between physical and sexual trauma, physiological and behavioral regulation, social functioning, and mental wellbeing.EducationPh.D. Bioengineering at University of Illinois at ChicagoB.A. Psychology at University of North Carolina at Chapel HillRecent grants, contracts, and other fundingDr. Lewis is currently supporting two Department of Defense grants:Evaluating the effectiveness of heart rate variability biofeedback for enhancing psychological resilience in members of the Reserve Component, andEvaluating the feasibility of a wearable sensor based platform for detection of infectious disease exposure.Research interestsBioengineeringSignal ProcessingWearable SensorsPsychophysiology Additional links and resources Explore Home About Research Collections Learning News + Events Resources Library Catalog Opportunities Scholarships Media Connect Instagram LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Newsletter Plan a Visit Contact the Library Donate Kinsey Institute Lindley Hall 305150 S Woodlawn Ave.Bloomington, IN 47405(812) 855-7686kinsey@iu.edu",
