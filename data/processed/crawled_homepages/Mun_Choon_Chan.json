Home Publications Grants Past Projects Past Students Teaching Services Software News Chan Mun Choon I graduated with a BS in Computer and Electrical Engineering from Purdue University and Ph.D. from Columbia University. I was a Member of Technical Staff in the Networking Research Laboratory, Bell Labs, Lucent Technologies before joining NUS. I am currently a Professor in the Department of Compuer Science, School of Computing. Contact: School of Computing, National University of Singapore Office: COM3 #02-15 Tel: +65 6516 7372 Email: chanmc AT comp dot nus dot edu dot sg Job/Research Opportunities I am looking to offer research projects in the areas related to programming networks (DPTP, DySo, SynDB, FCM) and 5G network (FSA, SLIC, PR3) Current Projects Programmable Network Research advances in Software Defined Networking (SDN) have enabled new paradigms and architectures through providing programmable capabilities to both the control and data plane. I am particularly interested in understanding how these capabilities enable new monitoring frameworks, control paradigms, virtualization strategies and speedup of large scale distributed computations.

We look into various approaches in which these devices can leverage the available sensing, computation and communication capabilities to design collaborative applications. In particular, we are looking at how high-fidelity context awareness can be achieved with low-cost sensing and communication on resource-constrained devices and possibly with collaboration among many different devices.
