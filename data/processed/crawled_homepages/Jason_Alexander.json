  "content": "Professor Jason Alexander Professor Jason Alexander Jason is a Professor in Human-Computer Interaction in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Bath. His primary research area is Human-Computer Interaction, with a particular interest in developing novel interactive systems that straddle the physical-digital interface. His recent work focuses on the development of shape-changing interfaces—surfaces that can dynamically change their geometry based on digital content or user input—and their application to Data Physicalization. Alexander's other work has investigated novel interaction techniques using eye-gaze, haptic feedback, and gestural interaction. He is always keen to hear from enthusiastic prospective Ph.D. students or post-docs wishing to work in these areas. He was previously a Senior Lecturer in the School of Computing and Communications at Lancaster University, and a post-doctoral researcher in the Bristol Interaction and Graphics (BIG) group at the University of Bristol. Before that he was a Ph.D. student in the HCI and Multimedia Lab at the University of Canterbury. Copyright © 2025 Jason Alexander",
