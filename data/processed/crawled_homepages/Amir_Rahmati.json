He is the director of Ethos Security and Privacy lab and a member of Stony Brook National Security Institute. Amir’s research broadly focuses on system security. He is particularly interested in the security and privacy challenges of emerging technologies, including IoT, AR, and ML systems. Teaching 2025 CSE360: Software Security Stony Brook University - Fall 2025 Aug 5, 2025 2025 CSE502: Computer Architecture Stony Brook University - Fall 2025 Aug 5, 2025 See all Research I lead the Ethos lab at Stony Brook University. In Ethos lab, we focus on improving the security of emerging technologies, such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices and Cyber-Physical systems. Our work involves designing, building, and evaluating systems that tackle security challenges in these domains. As we move towards a world where many resource- and energy-limited devices have access to our data & activities, our research creates an avenue for these devices to incorporate security in their design. Prospective Students I am looking for students with diverse backgrounds and expertise to work on challenging research problems across the system stack. Do you like designing and developing elegant systems that tackle real-world problems? Do you have expertise in hardware, software, machine learning, UX, or network protocols and measurement? Are you passionate about security and privacy? If your answer to these questions is yes, there may be a place for you in my group. Interested? Fill out this form and tell me about yourself. Then, apply to our graduate program. Publications Kwangyun Keum, Dheeraj Kumar, Bogdan Barchuk, Sai Chand Boyapati, Rohit Deopura, Amir Rahmati (2025). Obfusc8: LLM-Augmented PowerShell Obfuscation.
