I am an Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University in the Computer Science Department. I was previously a Postdoctoral Member at the Institute for Advanced Study, and received my PhD at Stanford University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Aaron Sidford. Before attending Stanford, I graduated from MIT in May 2018. I work broadly in mathematics and computer science, with interests in graph algorithms, optimization, high-dimensional geometry, and additive combinatorics. (CV). My research was supported by the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship from 2018-2021, and by a Google PhD Fellowship from 2022-2023.
