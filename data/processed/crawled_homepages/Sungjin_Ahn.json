Prior to joining KAIST, I served as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Rutgers University, where I was also affiliated with the Center for Cognitive Science. I direct the Machine Learning and Mind Lab, which operates at both KAIST and Rutgers, as well as the KAIST-Mila Prefrontal AI Research Center. You can find my research interests here. My academic journey includes earning a Ph.D. from the University of California, Irvine, where I studied scalable approximate Bayesian inference under Prof. Max Welling's supervision. Subsequently, I completed a postdoctoral fellowship at MILA, focusing on deep learning under the mentorship of Prof. Yoshua Bengio. My complete CV is available here.Biography [short] ContactEmail: sjn.[lastname]@gmail.com or [firstname].[lastname]@kaist.ac.krOffice: E3-1 3435, KAISTÂ Publication [Click]Google ScholarServicesConference Organization Committeeâ¢NeurIPS 2022 (Workshop Chair)Workshop Organizing Committeeâ¢ICML 2020, Object-Oriented Learning: Perception, Representation, and Reasoningâ¢ICLR 2022 Workshop on the Elements of Reasoning: Objects, Structure and CausalityArea Chairâ¢NeurIPS (2021~)â¢ICML (2021~)â¢ICLR (2023~)â¢AAAI(2021~)Reviewerâ¢NeurIPS (2015-2020)â¢ICML (2015-2020)â¢ICLR(2015-2022)â¢AISTATS(2015 - 2020)â¢AAAI(2015 - 2020)Â Awardsâ¢2024, KAIST Future-Leading Technologies in Artificial Intelligence [News]â¢2023, KAIST Breakthroughs, âAI self-learns to discover the structure of the world like humansââ¢2016, Best Paper Award, International Workshop on Parallel and Distributed Computing for Large Scale Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics (ParLearning)â¢2012, Best Paper Award, International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)Â Teachingâ¢2024-Spring, CS492, Deep Reinforcement Learning, KAISTâ¢2023-Fall, CS672, Reinforcement Learning (Graduate-Level), KAISTâ¢2023-Spring, CS492, Deep Reinforcement Learning, KAISTâ¢2022-Fall, CS570: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, KAISTâ¢2022-Spring, CS376: Machine Learning, KAISTâ¢2021-Spring, CS536: Machine Learning, Rutgers Universityâ¢2020-Fall, CS444: Topics in Computer Science: Deep Learning, Rutgers Universityâ¢2020-Spring, CS536: Machine Learning, Rutgers Universityâ¢2019-Fall, CS535: Pattern Recognition, Rutgers Universityâ¢2019-Spring, CS671: Probabilistic Agent Learning, Rutgers Universityâ¢2012-Fall, Project in AI, UC Irvine (Teaching Assistant)â¢2012-Summer, Undergraduate Summer Research in Machine Learning, UC Irvine (Teaching Assistant)â¢2012-Spring, Recommender Systems, UC Irvine (Teaching Assistant)Â Invited Talksâ¢âIn Search of Neural Language of Thought Models,â Language Intelligence Research Lab, ETRI, July, 2024â¢âIn Search of Neural Language of Thought Models,â Embodied Intelligence Research Lab, ETRI, June, 2024â¢âIn Search of Neural Language of Thought Models,â CVPR Workshop on Causal and Object-Centric Representations for Robotics, June 17, 2024â¢âWorld Models for High-Level Cognitionâ, CNIR Symposium on Brain, Mind, and Computation, Sungkyunkwan University, July, 2022â¢âUnsupervised Discovery of World Structureâ, KCC Machine Learning Workshop, Jeju, July 11, 2022â¢âDeep Learning for Understanding the World like Humansâ, Colloquium at KAIST Software Graduate Program, Mar 31, 2022â¢âUnsupervised Discovery of World Structureâ, Samsung Research, Mar 31, 2022â¢Handong Global University, Feb. 2021â¢Element AI, Canada, Nov. 2019â¢Center for Cognitive Science, Rutgers University, Nov. 2019â¢New York University, USA, Nov. 2019â¢KAIST, Korea, Aug. 6, 2018â¢Naver, Korea, Aug. 3, 2018â¢Kakao Brain, Korea, Aug. 2, 2018â¢Kakao Brain, Korea, Aug. 18, 2017â¢Vector Institute, Toronto, May. 9, 2017â¢Rutgers University, New Jersey, May. 1, 2017â¢Microsoft Research, Redmond, Apr. 28, 2017â¢Microsoft Maluuba, Montreal, Apr. 19, 2017â¢Element AI, Montreal, Apr. 7, 2017â¢IBM T.
