I am a professor in the Department of Computer Science at Georgetown University. I concluded my term as the the Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS) in July 2024. My research interests include machine learning, data mining, on-line learning algorithms, concept drift, and applications of machine learning and data mining to computer security. I led the effort that established Georgetown's first graduate programs in computer science and served as their first director. In 2004, I shared with Zico Kolter the award for the best application paper at KDD for our work on detecting malicious executables. In 2007, I shared with Greg Stephens and Kate Arndt a Program Innovation Award from the MITRE Corporation for our work on detecting insider threats. I have served as a consultant to industry, government, and nonprofit organizations. I teach the department's courses on machine learning (COSC-3460, COSC-5460) and artificial intelligence (COSC-3450, COSC-5440). I also teach some of the department's introductory courses, such as Computer Science II (COSC-1030) and Data Structures (COSC-2010). This semester, I am teaching Data Structures (COSC-2010) Office hours: In person (325 STM): TR 12:30–1:50 PM; Online: M 10:30–11:30 AM, W 3:00–4:00 PM (and by appointment). Next semester, I am teaching Artificial Intelligence (COSC-3450) For fun, I play a little guitar and do a little sailing. I'm always in search of great sushi. Lately, the best has been at umi in San Francisco. News July 16, 2025: Clay Shields and I taught Introduction to Computer Science as part of Georgetown's Summer College Immersion Program. August 25, 2024: The Washington Monthly ranked Georgetown second among the best colleges for women to study computer science. We ranked behind CMU and head of Harvey Mudd. I see this as a great accomplishment for our admissions team, administrators, faculty, and students.
