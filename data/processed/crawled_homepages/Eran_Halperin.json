Breaking News: Our lab is moving to NYU starting January 2026. If you are interested in joining us in NYC, please apply to the PhD Program in Computer Science at NYU and list Eran Halperin as a potential advisor. For post-doc positions, please inquire by email.Eran Halperin's CVResearchOur lab aims to improve our understanding, early detection, and treatment of human disease by the analysis of big data. We have been developing computational methods for genomic data (genetics, methylation, RNA expression, single-cell and single-nucleus RNA, microbiome data), medical imaging (OCT, MRI, Ultrasound, CT), electronic health records, and physiological waveforms (ECG, PPG, Artherial blood pressure). ​​ The methodology we apply and develop involves a combination of machine learning, optimization algorithms, combinatorial optimization, and Bayesian statistics. In particular, our lab is currently focusing on the development of methods in the following domains: Methods for cell-type specific genomic data. We develop methods for the analysis of methylation and RNA in the cell-type specific level, both using deconvolution methods of bulk data, and by developing new methods for the anlaysis of single-cell RNA and methylation data. We then connect apply these methods to study human disease. Machine Learning in medicine. We develop computational methods to assist different fields of medicine, including ophthalmology (e.g., Rakocz et al., Nature Digital Medicine, 2021, Avram et al., Nature BIomedical Engineering, 2024) and anesthesiology (e.g., Hill et al., Scientific Reports, 2021), and acute medicine (e.g., Rakocz et al., KDD, 2021). Our algorithms include new deep architectures, as well as more traditional approaches in machine learning and statistics. ​ Selected Publications \"Accurate prediction of disease-risk factors from volumetric medical scans by a deep vision model pre-trained with 2D scans\", Nature Biomedical Engineering, 2024 ​ \"Methylation risk scores are associated with a collection of phenotypes within electronic health record systems\" Nature Genomics Medicine, 2022 ​ \"Imputation of the continuous arterial line blood pressure waveform from non-invasive measurements using deep learning\" Scientific Reports, 2021 \"Automated identification of clinical features from sparsely annotated 3-dimensional medical imaging\" Nature Digital Medicine, 2021 ​ \"A Statistical Model for Quantifying the Needed Duration of Social Distancing for the COVID-19 Pandemic\" KDD, 2021 ​ \"Optimized design of single-cell RNA sequencing experiments for cell-type-specific eQTL analysis\" Nature Communication, 2020 ​ \"Accurate estimation of cell composition in bulk expression through robust integration of single-cell information.\" Nature Communications, 2020 ​ \"Context-aware dimensionality reduction deconvolutes gut microbial community dynamics\" Nature Biotechnology 2020 ​ \"FEAST: fast expectation-maximization for microbial source tracking\" Nature Methods, 2019 ​ \"Cell-type-specific resolution epigenetics without the need for cell sorting or single-cell biology\" Nature Communications, 2019 ​ \"CONFINED: distinguishing biological from technical sources of variation by leveraging multiple methylation datasets\" Genome Biology, 2019 ​ \"Detecting heritable phenotypes without a model using fast permutation testing for heritability and set-tests\" Nature Communications, 2018 ​ \"BayesCCE: a Bayesian framework for estimating cell-type composition from DNA methylation without the need for methylation reference.\" Genome Biology, 2018 ​ \"Correcting for cell-type heterogeneity in DNA methylation: a comprehensive evaluation\" Nature Methods, 2017 ​ Sparse PCA corrects for cell type heterogeneity in epigenome-wide association studies\" Nature Methods, 2016 ​ \"Fast and accurate construction of confidence intervals for heritability\" The American Journal of Human Genetics, 2016 \"A genetic and socioeconomic study of mate choice in Latinos reveals novel assortment patterns.\" PNAS, 2015. Read more \"Identifying personal genomes by surname inference\" Science, 2013. Read more \"A model-based approach for analysis of spatial structure in genetic data\" Nature Genetics, 2012. Read more \"Genome-wide association study of follicular lymphoma identifies a risk locus at 6p21.32\" Nature Genetics, 2010. Read more \"Genomic privacy and limits of individual detection in a pool\" Nature Genetics, 2009. Read more \"Maximizing power in association studies\" Nature Biotechnology, 27(3), 255-6, 2009. Read more ​ \"Estimating local ancestry in admixed populations\" The American Journal of Human Genetics, 2008.
