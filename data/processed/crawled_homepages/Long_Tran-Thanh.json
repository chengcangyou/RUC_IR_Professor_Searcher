Many thanks! Short bio: I am a Full Professor at the Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick. I did my PhD in AI at the University of Southampton under the supervision of Nick JenningsLink opens in a new window and Alex RogersLink opens in a new window. Before that I did my studies at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and InformaticsLink opens in a new window, Budapest University of Technology and Economics. Online lectures: (incomplete) list of my online lectures/mini-courses (on selected topics related to my research, including reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, game theory etc) can be found here.Link opens in a new window Research interests: My main research area is Artificial Intelligence. I am interested in developing mathematical foundations for large systems of autonomous and complex agents (either AI or human users) that have to:(i) collaborate with each other to deal with complex real-world problems; or(ii) strategically act against each other in order to achieve their own goals.In many cases, agents need to perform both, which adds an extra level of complexity to their decision making process.In my research, I typically combine techniques from online learning/decision making, game theory, and other areas of multi-agent systems. I am also interested in applying my findings to AI for Social Good. Digital Research Spotlight: I am also the Chair of the Warwick Interdisciplinary Research Spotlight in DigitalLink opens in a new window. This is a university's initiative to coordinate its research activities within AI, Data Science, Quantum Computing, Cyber Physical, and many more areas, focusing on the collaborative and interdisciplinary aspects. With my team, our goal is to create a community of excellence for interdisciplinary research, placing Warwick as a recognised global leader in digital research.PhD studentships, internships Prospective students: I am always looking for bright students with strong maths/stats/CS background. If you want to do a PhD with me then I would expect you to contact me by Sept/Oct. If your enquiries/research topic proposal are inline with my research, I will very likely respond to your email. Warwick students: If you would like to do an internship with me, the best way to do is through the URSS schemeLink opens in a new window. Current duties: Deputy Head (Director of Research), dept. of Computer Science, Warwick. Chair, Warwick Interdisciplinary Research Spotlight in Digital. Associate Editor of Artificial Intelligence, the flagship journal in AI. Associate Editor for the journal of Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (JAAMAS), the flagship journal in multiagent systems research. Past duties: Member of the IFAAMAS Board of DirectorsLink opens in a new window (2018-2024), the main governing body of the international community of autonomous agents and multiagent systems.
