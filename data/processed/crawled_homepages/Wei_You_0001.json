Before joining RUC, I did two-year (2017-2019) postdoctoral researcher in Department of Computer Science at Purdue University; and one-year (2016-2017) postdoctoral researcher in School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University. I obtained my Ph.D. from Renmin University of China in 2016. I am broadly interested in software engineering and software security. My work aims to build testing and analysis techniques for improving the reliability and security of complex software systems. My research has been recognized with several awards, including ACM SIGPLAN Distinguished Paper Award and CCF Award for Innovation on Computer Science and Engineering (Nature Science Award).
