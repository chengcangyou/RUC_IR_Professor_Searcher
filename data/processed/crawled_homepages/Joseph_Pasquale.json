I was a faculty member at UCSD between 1987 and 2025, and am now retired. My research is in operating systems, distributed systems and networks, broadly focusing on performance, reliability and security of Internet-scale systems with highly decentralized control. I also primarily teach our core courses on operating systems (at both graduate and undergraduate levels). Beyond computer science, I lead a summer study-abroad program in Rome, Italy, where we study the architectural geometry and structural engineering of classical Roman monuments. Research areas and topics Areas: operating systems, distributed systems and networks Current topics: IoT (Internet of Things), cloud computing, peer-to-peer systems, thin-client computing Past topics: long-running replicated systems, network-based I/O, I/O system software, extended client/server structures, mobile agents, packet scheduling for network QoS, OS/network support for multimedia (audio and video), TCP/IP performance, file system I/O performance, multicast routing Courses CSE 120: Operating Systems Principles CSE 220: Operating Systems Principles (MS) CSE 291-B: Advanced Studies in Classical Operating Systems (PhD and MS) CSE 221: Graduate Operating Systems (PhD) CSE 20: Discrete Mathematics CSE 21: Mathematics for Algorithms and Systems CSE 121: Operating Systems: Architecture and Implementation CSE 122: Operating Systems Laboratory Freshman Seminars CSE 87: The Science of Casino Games CSE 87: The Slide Rule: History, Theory, and Practice CSE 87: Freshman Seminar on Engineering the Roman Empire Senior Seminars CSE 192: Senior Seminar on Advanced Slide Rule CSE 192: Senior Seminar on Exploring Operating Systems CSE 192: Senior Seminar on Engineering the Roman Empire Global Seminar (Summer Study Abroad) CSE 4GS: Mathematical Beauty in Rome CSE 6GS: Mathematical Laboratory in Rome Affiliations UCSD CSE Alumni Board UCSD CSE Systems and Networking Group UCSD Center for Networked Systems COSMOS: Cal Summer School for Math/Science ( promo video, 2007, 2006, 2005 ) Miscellaneous NPR article on slide rules that mentions UCSD's Slide Rule Seminar Why Does A Slide Rule Work? , 2014 Oughtred Society conference in Las Vegas.

The real University, [Phaedrus] said, has no specific location. It owns no property, pays no salaries and receives no material dues. The real University is a state of mind. It is that great heritage of rational thought that has been brought down to us through the centuries and which does not exist at any specific location. It's a state of mind which is regenerated throughout the centuries by a body of people who traditionally carry the title of professor, but even that title is not part of the real University. The real University is nothing less than the continuing body of reason itself. from Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, by Robert Pirsig ______________ _______",
