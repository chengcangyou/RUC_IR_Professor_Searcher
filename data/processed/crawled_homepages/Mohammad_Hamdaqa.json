He is also an adjunct professor at the Department of Computer Science and a co-founder of the Centre of Financial Technology at Reykjavik University (Iceland). Hamdaqa received a Ph.D. in software engineering from the University of Waterloo in Canada in 2016. He holds a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering, a Master of Applied Science (Software Engineering), and a Master of Business Administration (MBA) with a minor in Management Information Systems (MIS). Hamdaqa’s work focuses on the interplay between emerging technologies and software applications, particularly how software engineering approaches, methods, and practices can be tailored to tame the complexities of building and deploying applications for the new emerging platforms. He is interested in exploring how models and model-driven engineering can empower the development of intelligent systems, as well as how machine learning and generative AI work in tandem with models to revolutionise the conceptualization of trustworthy software systems, ultimately enabling software development through user-friendly low-code platforms accessible to citizen developers. Hamdaqa has made contributions and published papers in the areas of model-driven software engineering, cloud computing, and blockchain. He is a member of the IEEE Computer Society (CS), the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), and the Icelandic Blockchain Foundation.
