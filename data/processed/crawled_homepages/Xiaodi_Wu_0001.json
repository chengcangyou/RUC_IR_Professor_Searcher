Mini-Library About me Xiaodi Wu ( in simplified Chinese ) I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies at the University of Maryland, College Park, and a Fellow at the Joint Center for Quantum Information and Computer Science (QuICS). I am also an Amazon Scholar working for AWS Braket. I am a recipient of the Sloan Research Fellowship, NSF CAREER, and AFOSR YIP awards. Before coming to Maryland, I was an Assistant Professor in the Computer and Information Science Department at the University of Oregon from 2015 to 2017. Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 2013 to 2015 (advisor: Aram Harrow, Scott Aaronson). I was also a Simons Research Fellow at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at Berkeley, for the program of Quantum Hamiltonian Complexity in Spring 2014 (advisor: Umesh Vazirani). I also spent two summers at the Institute for Quantum Computing, University of Waterloo as a student intern (advisor: John Watrous). I received my Ph.D. in theoretical computer science in 2013 (advisor: Yaoyun Shi) from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I received my B.S. degree in mathematics and physics in 2008 from the Academic Talent Program, Tsinghua University. Research Interests My research aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice for quantum computing by taking a full-stack software-hardware-algorithmic co-design approach. Specifically, my current research interests include: developing practical and deployable quantum applications (e.g., in optimization, machine learning, and simulation) by investigating computational models that capture the native programmability of quantum devices; building efficient and reliable systems to operate near-term and long-term quantum devices, including, e.g., the design and implementation of the programming interface, the design and implementation of real-time control systems for quantum devices, and quantum operating & network systems; automation and optimization of quantum application co-design with programming languages and machine learning techniques; investigating practical, robust, cost-effective controls of quantum devices. I also promote the paradigm of Hamiltonian-oriented Quantum Algorithm Design and Programming, which treats quantum Hamiltonian evolution as the central object in end-to-end quantum application design. We illustrate that the Hamiltonian-oriented design not only allows more efficient implementation of known quantum algorithms but also inspires novel quantum algorithms, especially in optimization and scientific computing (e.g., Quantum Hamiltonian Descent), which are hard to perceive in the circuit model. We also develop a programming infrastructure (i.e., SimuQ) for easy implementation of Hamiltonian-based quantum applications for domain experts on heterogeneous quantum devices. Please check my Research Overview for details of my existing and ongoing projects. Please also check the Advancing Quantum Computation Beyond Gate-Model (BGM 2024) workshop, which I co-organized to promote the Hamiltonian-oriented paradigm for end-to-end quantum applications. BGM 2026 will be hosted at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, UC Santa Barbara.
