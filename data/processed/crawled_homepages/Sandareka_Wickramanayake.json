Follow Sri Lanka Email Twitter LinkedIn Github Google ScholarHi, I am Sandareka.I am a Senior Lecturer at Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Moratuwa. I obtained my Ph.D. from the National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore in 2022 where I was supervised by Professor Wynne Hsu and Professor Mong Li Lee. I earned the BSc (Hons) in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Moratuwa in 2014.My research interests lie in the area of Interpretable Machine Learning, particularly designing accurate and interpretable Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In particular, I am interested in explaining the actual reasons behind DNN decisions in way that is easily understandable to human. My focus is developing methods to explain already-trained DNNs as well as developing inherently interpretable DNNs. I believe that improved understanding and performance will bolster public confidence in Artificial Intelligence (AI), leading to the increased adaption of AI systems in the real world.In addition, I work in developing state-of-the-art DNN-based model for real-world applications such as human activity recognition, automatic program repair, bio-metric authentication, scam detection and sign language recognition.Selected PublicationsSandareka Wickramanayake, Sanka Rasnayaka, Madhushika Gamage, Dulani Meedeniya, Indika Perera, “Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Enhanced Living Environments: A Study on User Perspective” in ADCOM Volume 134 - Internet of Things: Architectures for Enhanced Living Environments, Advances in Computer, 2023.       PaperManeesha Gunathilaka, Sandareka Wickramanayake, Dilum Bandara, , “DeFiTrust: A transformer-based framework for scam DeFi token detection using event logs and sentiment analysis” in ESWA, 2024.       Paper - CodeKim Nguyen, Sanka Rasnayaka, Sandareka Wickramanayake, Dulani Meedeniya, Sanjay Saha, Terence Sim, “Spatio-Temporal Dual-Attention Transformer for Time-Series Behavioral Biometrics”, IEEE Transactions on Biometrics, Behavior, and Identity Science (T-BIOM) , 2024.       Paper- CodeKD Pramod, WT De Silva, WU Thabrew, R Shariffdeen, S Wickramanayake. “BUGSPHP: A dataset for Automated Program Repair in PHP”.
