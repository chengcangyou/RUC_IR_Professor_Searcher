In 1983 I moved to Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, supported by a Fulbright scholarship, where I received a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science in 1988. After various scientific activities at the Mathematics and Computer Science Division of Argonne National Laboratory, Illinois, I moved to RWTH Aachen University in 1998, and took over the leadership of the computing center and the chair of the Institute for Scientific Computing. In July 2011, I took over, in a similar setup, the university computing center (HRZ) and the Institute for Scientific Computing of TU Darmstadt. Due to personal reasons, I stepped down as lead of HRZ in January 2022.Awards and distinctions 1983 – 1984 Fulbright Fellowship.1986 – 1988 Mathematical Sciences Institute Fellowship, Cornell University.1988 – 1989 First recipient of the Wilkinson Fellowship in Computational Mathematics, Argonne National Laboratory.1990 Best paper award (with Philippe Lacroute) at the CONPAR 90/VAPP IV Joint Conference on Vector and Parallel Processing for the Paper “An adaptive matrix blocking strategy”, Zürich, September 1990.1995 Jointly with Alan Carle recipient of the Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software for the ADIFOR 2.0 System at the ICIAM, Hamburg, Germany.2005 Offer of full professorship in Scientific Computing at the University Hamburg, in combination with the position of director of the German Climate Computing Center (www.dkrz.de).2008 Best Application Paper Award (with B.
