Concurrently, Mikael is also been pursuing research in analysis of real-time systems, where the goal is to find theoretical models for real-time systems that will allow their timing behavior and memory consumption to be calculated. Mikael received his PhD in computer systems 2000 from Uppsala University (Sweden). Since then he has been working in both academia and in industry with embedded systems, real-time systems, and embedded communications. Previous affiliations include Newline Information, Melody Interactive Solutions and CC Systems. In 2006 he joined MDU faculty as a full professor with specialty in real-time systems and vehicular software-systems.
