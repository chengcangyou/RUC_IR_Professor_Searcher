My Ph.D. is from the Weizmann Institute of Science. I spent two years as a postdoc in the Cryptography Group of MIT's Computer Science and AI Lab, two years as a postdoc in the Center for Research on Computation and Society at Harvard's department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and fourteen years at Reichman University. My main fields of interest are Cryptography and Computational Complexity. I am a founder of the FACT center and of the CIFRA institute. Conferences (PC Member) TCC 2005.
