Research My main research interests are the design, implementation and evaluation of high-level parallel and distributed programming languages; parallel and distributed functional programming, using Haskell, Erlang, and friends; and challenging parallel or distributed applications, e.g. algebraic computations, robot teams. So I'm interested in how to better exploit multi- and many-core machines, Clouds, High Performance Computers (HPC), and other platforms. Roles I'm a member of the Glasgow Parallelism Group (GPG). I'm a member of the Glasgow Systems Section (GLASS). I'm a member of the Programming Languages, Low Carbon and Sustainable Computing, and Understandable Autonomous Systems research themes.
