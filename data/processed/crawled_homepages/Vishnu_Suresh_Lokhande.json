I am also affiliated with the Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (IAD). My research focuses on computer vision and machine learning, aiming to enhance the reliability and robustness of models. I engage in applied research, drawing from ideas and concepts found in statistics, optimization, and mathematical literature related to modern deep neural networks. I earned my PhD in 2023 from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I had the privilege of being advised by Vikas Singh. Throughout my doctoral studies, I had valuable internships at Google Research (twice) and at Microsoft Research. Earlier, I received my BTech in Electrical Engineering from IIT Kanpur in 2016, under the guidance of Laxmidhar Behera. I am actively seeking collaborations and highly motivated Ph.D. candidates, as well as M.S. students at UB. Interested individuals are encouraged to apply here. Additionally, I am also open to exploring industrial collaboration opportunities, either as a consultant or part-time collaborator, and am willing to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) if required.",
