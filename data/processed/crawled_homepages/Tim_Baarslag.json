He is a Visiting Scholar at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), a Visiting Associate Professor at Nagoya University of Technology and a Visiting Fellow at the University of Southampton. Tim Baarslag studies intelligent and autonomous systems that can collaborate through the process of joint decision making. Practical applications include smart energy trading, the Internet of Things, trading platforms, autonomous vehicles, and digital privacy & security assistants. Tim Baarslag currently investigates how negotiation AI can coordinate multiple deals as part of an NWO Vidi grant, called COMBINE: Coordinating Multi-deal Bilateral Negotiations. His research is featured in Science Magazine, Artificial Intelligence, Wired, BBC Technology of Business, AI Magazine, MIT Technology Review, and New Scientist. Tim Baarslag graduated from Utrecht University with a MSc in Mathematics and a BSc in Computer Science (both cum laude). He obtained his PhD (cum laude) from Delft University of Technology in 2014 on the topic of intelligent decision support systems for automated negotiation. Between 2014 and 2016, he was a Research Fellow at the University of Southampton, where he worked on negotiation techniques for privacy and consent. Tim is the leading developer of Genius, a negotiation environment for the design and evaluation of automated negotiators. He is also an organizer of the annual International Automated Negotiating Agent Competition. Tim is a member of The Young Academy and the Council for Natural Sciences and Technology of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is also a founder member of the Netherlands Academy of Engineering and the ACM Future of Computing Academy for outstanding early career researchers. He serves as a PC member in top-level conferences such as AAAI and IJCAI, and as a reviewer in high-ranking journals such as Artificial Intelligence and JAAMAS.

Maybe a hagglebot can help I was interviewed for by BBC Technology of Business for the \"Olympics for hagglebots\": the Automated Negotiating Agent Competition, which pits more than 100 participants from Japan, France, Israel, Turkey and the United States against one another in five leagues. Postdoctoral Researcher (20 months) in AI and multi-agent systems at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI), Amsterdam (new deadline: June 22, 2020) I have a vacancy for a talented Postdoctoral Researcher on the topic of Multi-Agent Negotiation. The aim of the vacant position is to develop fundamental and applicable solutions for agent negotiations within a new online trading platform. Interview for Communications of the ACM I have been interviewed for the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) about the Automated Negotiating Agents Competition (ANAC), which I helped organize in July during the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) in Stockholm, Sweden. Science Talent 2018 nomination by New Scientist I have been nominated as Science Talent 2018 by New Scientist Magazine. This prize is awarded annually to a young researcher with a high scientific and social impact, who reaches a broad audience through his or her outreach activities. Please consider voting for me! Negotiation algorithms I appear on the Dutch science show Focus to talk about negotiation algorithms and how computers can now help you buy a house. Negotiation postdoc vacancy We have an open postdoc vacancy at CWI Amsterdam. We are looking for a Postdoc on learning utility functions for Negotiation and Intelligent Control. Computers that negotiate on our behalf I wrote an article for the European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics magazine on the challenges of computer negotiation on our behalf, and how new methods are being created at CWI towards solving this problem. Lecture on automated negotiation online I explain my research on automated negotiation in a 10 minute lecture for the 'Universiteit van Nederland' (in Dutch), which is a collaboration between universities and research institutes to collect lectures from the best Dutch scientists. I explain the future of computers that will be able to negotiate on our behalf, for instance when buying a house online or in autonomous driving. Winner of the ERCIM Cor Baayen Young Research Award I am happy to receive the 2017 ERCIM Cor Baayen Young Research Award. This prize is awarded yearly to a promising young researcher in computer science and applied mathematics and carries a prize of â¬5000. The prize is awarded by ERCIM, which is The European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics. CWI is a member of ERCIM, and so is for example Fraunhofer and INRIA. Each year, each member institute can nominate two candidates for the Cor Baayen Award, and an ERCIM committee determines the winner. Research featured in Wired My research on automated negotiation is featured in an article in Wired Germany: How would a machine conduct our salary negotiations?. People do not negotiate very well. Artificial intelligence, says Tim Baarslag, could do much better. He is working on a future in which AI will represent us in negotiations - whether on eBay or in politics... more IJCAI paper featured in Science Our IJCAI 2017 paper on the various challenges and applications for autonomous negotiation is featured in an article in Science: How artificial intelligence could negotiate better deals for humans. Veni grant for Representing Users in Negotiation I have been awarded a Veni grant for the project called Representing Users in a Negotiation (RUN): An Autonomous Negotiator Under Preference Uncertainty. The Veni grant provides highly promising young scientists with the opportunity to further elaborate their own ideas during a period of three years. Veni is part of the Talent Scheme by The Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO).
