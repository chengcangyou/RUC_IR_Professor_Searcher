Accept optional cookies Reject optional cookies Cookie settings Dr Scott Piao Senior Lecturer in Computer Science Profile I am a Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) in Computer Science of the School of Computing and Communications of Lancaster University. I have academic degrees of PhD (Lancaster University) and PGCert (Postgraduate Certificate Academic Practice). I have been engaged in research in the areas of Natural Language Processing, Text Mining, Social Computing and related system development. Since my completion of PhD degree, I have mostly worked in Lancaster University, but I also worked in The Department of Computer Science (Natural Language Processing Group) of Sheffield University (2000~2002) and The School of Computer Science (The National Centre for Text Mining) of Manchester University (2006~2009) as a Research Associate. Show more… Research Overview My research interests span Natural Language Processing, Text Mining, Social Computing and Data Science. I am interested in developing algorithms and tools for automatically analysing information hidden in langauge data and applying such techniques in various information systems. Over the past years, I have worked on seven major projects funded by EPSRC, ESRC, AHRC and EU, and served on program committees of forty-seven leading international conferences covering the areas of Natural Language Processing, Social Computing, Big Data and Corpus Linguistics. I served as an Area Chair in the LREC-COLING 2024 Conference, and currently I am an Area Chair of the COLING 2025 Conference. Recently I focus on exploring Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI models for autimatic analysis of various semantic information of language data.
