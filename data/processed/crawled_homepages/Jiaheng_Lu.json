My recent topics include multi-model database management systems, quantum computing for databases and job optimization for big data platform. I was awarded Ph.D. degree in 2007 from the National University of Singapore. My PhD topic was about XML query processing. I did two years Postdoc research at the University of California, Irvine. Then I joined the Renmin University of China in 2008, where I have worked for seven years. I am now working at the University of Helsinki, Finland. I have the broad research and teaching experiences in four countries (China, Singapore, USA, and Finland). Books News I gave a keynote talk on \"An algebraic framework for multi-model data management\" in ISIC 2025 conference. [ Slides ] (23.10.2025) We gave a new tutorial about vector databases and vector embedding at Europe Database Conference ADBIS 2025.

Research Topics Multi-model database management systems: As more businesses realized that data, in all forms and sizes, is critical to making the best possible decisions, we see the continued growth of systems that support massive volume of non-relational or unstructured forms of data. Our research focus is to develop new theories and algorithms of a novel multi-model database management system to manage both well-structured data and NoSQL data. Our approach will reduce integration issues, simplify operations, and eliminate migration issues between relational and NoSQL data.
