Building 3480 University StreetMontreal, QuebecCanada H3A 0E9 Research Themes Simulating Physics for Machine Learning How can physics-based models & solvers boost machine learning architectures (& vice-versa)? [Differentiable Imaging 1 & 2], [Fast Denoising], [Learning Dynamics, Planning & Shading (1 & 2)] Monte Carlo, Density Estimation & MCMC How do we efficiently solve multi-dimensional integrals for realistic image and sound synthesis? [Unified Beams & Points], [Joint IS], [Ray Lights 1, 2 & 3], [Beams 1 & 2], [Sampling 1, 2 & 3] Editing Physically-based Light Transport Can we devise intuitive controls to edit physically-based lighting in synthetic images? [Editing Paths in PBR], [Artistic Volumetric Effects], [Survey], [Direct Video Manipulation] Model Reduction for Dynamics & Lighting Can reduced models capture complex dynamics? [ZH 1, 2 & 3], [MRT 1, 2 & 3] [Filtered Transport (1, 2) & Appearance (1, 2)] [Reflectance 1, 2, 3] Editing Complex Fluid Simulations How do digital artists author turbulent fluid simulations? Can we design tools to help them? [Vortex Ring Editing], [Turbulent Wave Details] Manufacturing Passive Optics & Probes Can combining computation with 3D fabrication allow us to warp & capture light in the real world? [Magic Lens], [Shaping Shadows], [Augmented Reality Lighting], [Manufacturing AR Probes] Visually browse my research highlights, by theme, below: Beam density estimation and many-light methods. Path connection strategies in light transport. Artist tools for digital content creation. Using fabrication to warp light in the real world. Interactive shadows and global illumination. Capturing geometry and reflectance in the wild. Geometry analysis for artistic line drawings. Research Group & Teaching I'm not currently recruiting & will not reply to requests for supervision.
