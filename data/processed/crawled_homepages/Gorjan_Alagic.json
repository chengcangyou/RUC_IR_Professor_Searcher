I’m currently a member of the QuICS center at the University of Maryland, and a guest researcher at NIST. “… quantum computers will use ‘qubits’ that behave in surprising ways, efficiently performing selected mathematical algorithms exponentially faster than a classical computer… A sufficiently large quantum computer, if built, would be capable of undermining all widely-deployed public key algorithms used for key establishment and digital signatures.”– the NSA",
