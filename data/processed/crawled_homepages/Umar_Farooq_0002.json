Taylor Hall ufarooq at lsu.edu | | | | | Short Bio: I am an Assistant Professor in Computer Science & Engineering at Louisiana State University, where I focus on enhancing the reliability, security, and efficiency of software systems. This involves developing program analysis techniques, addressing software engineering challenges in quantum computing, including the transition to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and its readiness, and investigating the application of LLMs to automate and improve the software development lifecycle. Prior to joining LSU in Fall 2023, I gained valuable industry experience as a software engineer for compiler infrastructure at ByteDance/TikTok, contributing to high-performance computing solutions. I earned my Ph.D. from the University of California, Riverside (UCR), under the guidance of Dr. Zhijia Zhao.

This study conducts a large-scale mining analysis of over 21,000 GitHub repositories, containing 1.2 million commits from more than 10,000 developers, to examine the evolution and maintenance of quantum software. We analyze repository growth, programming language and framework adoption, and contributor trends, revealing a 200% increase in repositories and a 150% rise in contributors since 2017. Additionally, we investigate software development and maintenance practices, showing that perfective commits dominate (51.76%), while the low occurrence of corrective commits (18.54%) indicates potential gaps in bug resolution. Furthermore, 34% of reported issues are quantum-specific, highlighting the need for specialized debugging tools beyond conventional software engineering approaches. This study provides empirical insights into the software engineering challenges of quantum computing, offering recommendations to improve development workflows, tooling, and documentation. We are also open-sourcing our dataset to support further analysis by the community and to guide future research and tool development for quantum computing.

While graph systems have been proposed recently for large-scale CFL reachability analysis of system software, the design space has not yet been systematically explored, leading to sub-optimal performance. This workpresents GraCFL, a holistically designed graph system for CFL reachability. Inspired by the vertex-centric processing paradigm, we formalize CFL reachability using a multi-directional vertex-centric model. We then analyze this model in terms of computation redundancy, strategies for deriving new reachability, data locality, and parallelism. The analysis reveals a set of insights that guide the design of new techniques and optimizations to improve system performance. As a result of the systematic design, GraCFL demonstrates superior performance compared to state-ofthe-art graph systems, with an average 14.14Ã speedup over Graspan and 8.33Ã speedup over POCR.

While NIST has released post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) standards (e.g., Kyber, Dilithium), mobile app ecosystems remain largely unprepared for this transition. We present a large-scale binary analysis of over 4,000 Android apps to assess cryptographic readiness. Our results show widespread reliance on quantum-vulnerable algorithms such as MD5, SHA-1, and RSA, while PQC adoption remains absent in production apps. To bridge the readiness gap, we explore LLM-assisted migration. We evaluate leading LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini Flash, Claude Sonnet, etc.) for automated cryptographic migration. All models successfully performed simple hash replacements (e.g., SHA-1 to SHA-256). However, none produced correct PQC upgrades due to multi-file changes, missing imports, and lack of context awareness. These results underscore the need for structured guidance and system-aware tooling for post-quantum migration. @inproceedings{sp2025, author = {Strauss, Joseph and Upadhyay, Krishna and Siddique, AB and Baggili, Ibrahim and Farooq, Umar}, booktitle = {46th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy}, title = {Assessing and Enhancing Quantum Readiness in Mobile Apps}, year = {2025}, volume = {}, issn = {}, doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2506.00790}, url = {https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2506.00790} } 2023 SIGIRâ23 MobileRec: A Large Scale Dataset for Mobile Apps Recommendation MH Maqbool,Â Umar Farooq,Â Adib Mosharrof,Â AB Siddique,Â andÂ Hassan Foroosh In Proceedings of the 46th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, 2023 Abs Bib HTML PDF Recommender systems have become ubiquitous in our digital lives, from recommending products on e-commerce websites to suggesting movies and music on streaming platforms. Existing recommendation datasets, such as Amazon Product Reviews and MovieLens, greatly facilitated the research and development of recommender systems in their respective domains. While the number of mobile users and applications (aka apps) has increased exponentially over the past decade, research in mobile app recommender systems has been significantly constrained, primarily due to the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets, as opposed to recommendations for products, movies, and news. To facilitate research for app recommendation systems, we introduce a large-scale dataset, called MobileRec. We constructed MobileRec ",
