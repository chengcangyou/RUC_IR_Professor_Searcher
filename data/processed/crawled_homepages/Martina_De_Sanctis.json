Previously, I was a PostDoc in the DAS Research Unit at Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) in Trento, Italy. I completed my Ph.D. at the Doctoral School in Information and Communication Technology, University of Trento and Fondazione Bruno Kessler. My thesis is about a design for adaptation framework for the modeling and execution of service-based systems via dynamic adaptation, and it has been successfully defended, on May 2018. I joined the GSSI in 2018 as a postdoctoral researcher. I became an Assistant Professor in 2020. I received my master's degree in Computer Science from the University of L'Aquila (Italy) in 2012. My master's thesis topic was \"Modeling performance antipatterns in the architectural description language « Ãmilia »\". I worked as a programmer in private companies before joining the DAS Research Unit at the Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) in July 2013. My main research interests include software engineering, software architecture, internet of services, service-oriented architecture, distributed adaptive systems, collective adaptive systems, and IoT-based (adaptive) systems. A complete CV here. Last update on 07 February 2022. News 2022: Best Reviewer Award for the Journal of Software and Systems Modeling (SoSyM) for the year 2021. 2021: I have been appointed as a member of the novel Program Committee Board (PCB) of IJCAI - International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence for the next three years. 2021: Program Committee member ICSOC2021.

June 2020: I became an Assistant Professor at GSSI. June 2019: Our paper âQoS-Based Formation of Software Architectures in the Internet of Thingsâ was accepted and will be presented at ECSA2019. November 2018: I joined the Gran Sasso Science Institute as a postdoctoral researcher. September 2018: I held a tutorial about A Design for Adaptation Framework for Self-Adaptive Systems at SASO 2018. The slides of the tutorial are available here. July 2018: The joint work with the colleagues from the University of Malmo, Sweden, IOTAP LAb, titled Enacting Emergent Configurations in the IoT through Domain Objects, has been accepted as full paper at ICSOC 2018. November 2017: I presented ATLAS: A World-wide Travel Assistant exploiting Service-based Adaptive Technologies at ICSOC 2017.
