Her research focuses on pushing the boundaries of natural language generation and understanding, developing innovative model architectures, training methodologies, and robust evaluation metrics. With the rapid growth of information from diverse sources, Dr. Liu develops techniques that enable systems to effectively distill, interpret, and generate meaningful insights from massive datasets. Dr. Liu held a postdoctoral fellowship at Carnegie Mellon University, where she was a member of Noah's ARK. Prior to that, she worked as a senior scientist at Bosch Research in Palo Alto, California. Bosch is one of Germany's largest companies and a leading provider of intelligent car systems and home appliances. Dr. Liu received her Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Texas at Dallas, supported by the Erik Jonsson Distinguished Research Fellowship. Her academic journey began at Fudan University, where she completed her bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science. Dr. Liu has published over 90 peer-reviewed papers in top-tier conferences and journals, and she regularly serves on program committees for major international conferences. In 2015, she was selected for the \"MIT Rising Stars in EECS\" program. Her research has been recognized with multiple awards, including a Best Paper Award Finalist at WWW 2016, an Area Chair Favorite Paper at COLING 2018, an Amazon AWS Machine Learning Research Award in 2020, the NSF CAREER Award in 2022, and a SAC Highlights Award at ACL 2025 (awarded to the top 1% of over 8,000 paper submissions).
