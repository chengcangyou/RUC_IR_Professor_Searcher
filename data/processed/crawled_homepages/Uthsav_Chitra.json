I am affiliated with the Data Science and AI Institute and the Center for Computational Biology. My research broadly focuses on developing machine learning methods for addressing fundamental problems in biology. I am particularly interested in developing spatiotemporal and graph-based models for next-generation biological technologies. Please see my group website for details. I was previously a postdoctoral fellow at the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Princeton University where I was very fortunate to be advised by Ben Raphael. Relevant links: CV, Google Scholar, research statement.
