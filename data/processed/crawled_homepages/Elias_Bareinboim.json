I obtained my Ph.D. under Judea Pearl at the University of California, Los Angeles. My research interests span artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, robotics, cognitive science, and the philosophy of science. My work focuses on the foundations of causal inference and its applications to artificial intelligence as well as to data science (including health and social sciences). – Causal Artificial Intelligence. I believe that the ability to learn, process, and leverage causal information is crucial for developing more general AI and addressing many challenges and bottlenecks in real-world, high-stakes situations. For instance, my research group has studied the interplay between causal knowledge and decision-making in various publications, including (NeurIPS-15, ICML-17, IJCAI-17, NeurIPS-18, AAAI-19, NeurIPS-19, ICML-20, NeurIPS-20a, b, c, NeurIPS-21, CleaR-22, ICLR-23, AAAI-24, ICLR-24, NeurIPS-24, ICLR-25, ICML-25, UAI-25). This work is based on a framework called causal reinforcement learning, which was introduced in a tutorial at ICML-20 and summarized in this paper (link). My group also demonstrated the key role of causality in the context of explanations, including fairness analysis in various contexts (AAAI-18, NeurIPS-18, UAI-19, NeurIPS-23a, b, AAAI-24, NeurIPS-24, AAAI-25). This work is based on a framework called causal fairness analysis, which was presented in a tutorial at ICML-22 and is summarized in our FnTML-24 paper. Additionally, we showed that causality is fundamental to generative modeling, including applications in computer vision, as discussed in various papers (CVPR-22, ICLR-23, NeurIPS-23, AAAI-24, ICML-24, NeurIPS-24). This work builds on our formalization of the Pearl Causal Hierarchy, developed in the ACM-22 chapter, which led to the discovery of how causal and neural modes of reasoning are related, as presented in the NeurIPS-21 paper. – Causal Data Science. I also believe that causality is an essential component in making credible scientific claims and should form the basis of the discipline of data science. Specifically, my group is interested in understanding how to make robust and generalizable interventional and counterfactual claims in the context of heterogeneous and biased data collections, addressing challenges such as confounding bias, selection bias, dataset shifts, and issues of external validity (transportability). A survey of recent developments on this topic, when combining massive sets of research data, appeared at the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), see the story and the paper. A brief summary of the automated scientist project was also highlighted at the IEEE Intelligent Systems (link, story). For an overview of some of my thoughts on causal data science, refer to the talk I gave at Columbia University, link. For some of the latest results on this topic, please refer to (UAI-19, ICML-19a, b, NeurIPS-19, AAAI-20a, b, ICML-20, NeurIPS-20, NeurIPS-21a, b, ICML-22, NeurIPS-23, AAAI-24, NeurIPS-24a, b, AAAI-25a, b).
