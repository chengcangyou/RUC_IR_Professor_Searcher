He received a Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna (SSSUP) in January 2002. Since 2002 he has been the Principal Investigator at the \"Real Time and Embedded System Laboratory\" and professor in the Department of Computer Science, with courtesy appointments in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Coordinated Science Lab (CSL), and Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Caccamo received visiting professorships at ETH, Zurich and TUM Munich as TÜV Süd Stiftung visiting professor and August-Wilhelm Scheer guest professor. He has chaired Real-Time Systems Symposium and Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium, the two IEEE flagship conferences on Real-Time Systems. He also served as General Chair of Cyber Physical Systems Week. In 2003, he was awarded an NSF CAREER Award. Since 2018, he is a recipient of the Alexander von Humboldt Professorship at TUM and he is IEEE Fellow. In broad terms, his research interests are centered on the area of embedded systems. He has worked in close collaboration with avionics, farming, and automotive industries developing innovative software architectures and toolkits for the design automation of embedded digital controllers, and low-level resource management solutions for real-time operating systems running on multicore architectures. More recently, he has begun to investigate real-time, security, and robustness problems in the software architecture of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
