I'm particularly interested in programs and systems combining higher-order features (e.g., callbacks and code transmission) with side-effects (e.g., state and communication). I am also interested in next-generation programming paradigms that can make multicore and distributed systems manageable to program. I am currently working on the foundational and practical aspects of a novel transactional construct called Communicating Transactions and on type systems which can express the communication patterns of software, callled Session Types.
