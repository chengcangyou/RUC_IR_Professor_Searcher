I am a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor at UC Riverside, CSE Department. I am a cooperating faculty member at ECE department. My research interests are in the broad area of networking, systems, and cybersecurity, aiming to build performant, intelligent, secure, and resilient networked systems. My recent research specifically targets IoT, 5G, and next-generation wireless networked systems. Before joining UCR, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at UCLA, working with Prof. Songwu Lu. I received my Ph.D. degree from the same research group in 2022. Prior to UCLA, I got my BS degree (with honor) in CS from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), under supervision of Prof. Xinbing Wang and Prof. Xiaofeng Gao.
