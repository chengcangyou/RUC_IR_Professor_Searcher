His research interests lie in the broad area of bioinformatics, computational biology, and machine learning. More specifically, his current research focuses on three areas: (1) machine learning methods for modeling and analyzing cis-regulatory networks; (2) graph algorithms for analyzing complex biological networks to facilitate knowledge discovery; and (3) data mining approaches to biomarker discovery and disease prediction via integrated analysis of heterogonous \"omics\" data. In addition, he has extensive collaborations with biologists at UTSA and the UT Health Science Center for a broad spectrum of bioinformatics applications involving genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic data. He received a Best Performer award in the Third Annual DREAM Reverse Engineering Challenges in 2008. His research has been sponsored by NIH, NSF, and the San Antonio Life Sciences Institute.
