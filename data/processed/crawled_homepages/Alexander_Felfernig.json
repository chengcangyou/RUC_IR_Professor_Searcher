I direct the Applied Software Engineering & AI research group (ASE). My research interests include configuration systems, recommender systems, sustainability, model-based diagnosis, software requirements engineering, different aspects of human decision making, and knowledge acquisition methods. I have published numerous papers in renowned international conferences and journals (e.g., IJCAI, AAAI, ECAI, ACM Recommender Systems, ACM Intelligent User Interfaces, AI Magazine, Artificial Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, IEEE Intelligent Systems, Journal of Electronic Commerce) and I am a co-author of the books on “Recommender Systems” published by Cambridge University Press, ”Knowledge-based Configuration” published by Elsevier/Morgan Kaufmann, and “Group Recommender Systems” and “Feature Models – AI-Driven Design, Analysis and Applications” published by Springer. I also acted as an organizer of international conferences and workshops such as the ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, the International Symposium on Methodologies for Intelligent Systems, the International Workshop on Configuration, and the ACM Systems and Software Product Line Conference.
