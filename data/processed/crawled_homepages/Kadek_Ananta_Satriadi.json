He earned his PhD in immersive geovisualization from Monash University. His professional journey includes postdoctoral positions at the University of South Australia's Wearable Computer Lab, and later at Monash University's Embodied Visualisation Group and Action Lab. In 2024, Kadek transitioned to a lectureship role, continuing his work in innovative visualisation research and education. Homepage: https://kadeksatriadi.com.Research interestsMy primary research interest lies in immersive visualisation and analytics, a field that combines cutting-edge spatial computing technology with innovative data representation techniques. I explore this fascinating area through various lenses: geospatial data analysis — developing immersive tools to better understand and interact with complex geographical information.situated data analysis — developing effective data visualisation within its contextual environments.immersive data storytelling — developing compelling narratives using virtual and augmented reality to make data more accessible and engaging. Beyond immersive technologies, I maintain a keen interest in traditional visualization methods and their applications. My work often intersects with computing for social good, as I believe in harnessing the power of technology to address societal challenges. I am currently leading the Bali Digital Heritage Initiative (badhi.id). This initiative aims to empower Balinese communities in the preservation of Balinese culture through responsible, sustainable, innovative, and collaborative, digitisation efforts.Supervision interestsI am seeking research students who are enthusiastic about immersive spatial computing technology in the context of my research interests.
