Acquiring Visual-Motor Models for Precision Manipulation with Robot Hands In Proc of 4th European Conference on Computer Vision, 1996, p. 603-612. We use a combination of two techniques to achieve dextrous robot fine manipulation: the use of an approximate estimated motor model, based on the grasp tetrahedron acquired when grasping an object, and the use of visual feedback to achieve accurate fine manipulation.

HTML version Also: pdf version We present a promising approach for combined visual model acqusition and agent control. The approach differs from previous work in that a full coupled Jacobian is estimated on-line without any prior models, or the introduction of special calibration movements. We show how the estimated models can be used for visual space robot task specification, planning and control. In the other direction the same type of models can be used for view synthesis.
