My research methodology combines empiricism with analytical techniques. Some of my recent research includes: designing secure and usable authentication systems, securing private data in trigger-action platforms, mitigating abuse of smart home devices by an abusive intimate partner, and building security mindset in CS undergraduate students. My CV can be found here. Also check out our Madison Security & Privacy group. I am always looking for self-motivated students who are interested in working on real-world digital security and privacy problems. If you have a relevant research idea and want to collaborate please drop me a note. With the help of a number of motivated students, we run Madison Tech Clinic (MTC) to support survivors of domestic and intimate partner violence who are experiencing technology-faciliated abuse. This is an initiative similar to CETA in NYC. We are looking for passionate volunteers for MTC. Please reach out to me if you are interested.
