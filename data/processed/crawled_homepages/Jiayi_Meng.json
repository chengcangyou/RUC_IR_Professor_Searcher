My research interests are in Systems and Networking, with a focus on Mobile Systems and Mobile Networking. I now work on how to build systems to support immersive computing (e.g., Virtual/Augmented/Mixed Reality) via edge computing over 5G and beyond. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Purdue University. Previously, I received B.E. at School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).
