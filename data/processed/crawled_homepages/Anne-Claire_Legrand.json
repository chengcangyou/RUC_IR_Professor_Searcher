The aim of calibration is to correct raw acquired image for the various acquisition device signal deformation, such as noise, lighting uniformity, white balance and color deformation, due, for a great part, to camera spectral sensitivities. We first present reference color data computation obtained from camera's spectral sensitivities and reflectance of reference patches, taken form Gretag MacBeth Color Chart DC. Then we give a color calibration method based on linear regression. We finally evaluate the quality of applied calibration and present some resulting calibrated images.Download Rapid prototyping of image analysis algorithms on an adaptive FGPA architectureEuropean Signal Processing Conference, Sep 3, 2007The aim of this work is to propose a fast and reliable design flow for the implementation of some... more The aim of this work is to propose a fast and reliable design flow for the implementation of some image analysis algorithms on an adaptive architecture using an FPGA platform. This adaptive architecture is designed in a Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous (GALS) approach so that the hardware resources are stand-alone modules. Any modification only affects the target module, not the entire system. The design flow associated to this architecture includes IP libraries for all reused modules and a high-level development tool called Handle-C for the design of new modules. The image processing designer implements any image analysis algorithm in a reliable way without any hardware specialist.Download Evaluation and Design Space Exploration of a Time-Division Multiplexed NoC on FPGA for Image Analysis ApplicationsarXiv (Cornell University), Feb 9, 2010The aim of this paper is to present an adaptable Fat Tree NoC architecture for Field Programmable... more The aim of this paper is to present an adaptable Fat Tree NoC architecture for Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) designed for image analysis applications. Traditional NoCs (Network on Chip) are not optimal for dataflow applications with large amount of data. On the opposite, point to point communications are designed from the algorithm requirements but they are expensives in terms of resource and wire. We propose a dedicated communication architecture for image analysis algorithms. This communication mechanism is a generic NoC infrastructure dedicated to dataflow image processing applications, mixing circuit-switching and packet-switching communications. The complete architecture integrates two dedicated communication architectures and reusable IP blocks. Communications are based on the NoC concept to support the high bandwidth required for a large number and type of data. For data communication inside the architecture, an efficient time-division multiplexed (TDM) architecture is proposed. This NoC uses a Fat Tree (FT) topology with Virtual Channels (VC) and flit packet-switching with fixed routes. Two versions of the NoC are presented in this paper. The results of their implementations and their Design Space Exploration (DSE) on Altera StratixII are analyzed and compared with a point to point communication and illustrated with a multispectral image application. Results show that a point-to-point communication scheme is not efficient for large amount of multispectral image data communications. A NoC architecture uses only 10% of the memory blocks required for a point to point architecture but seven times more logic elements. This resource allocation is more adapted to image analysis algorithms as memory elements are a critical point in embedded architectures. A FT NoC-based communication scheme for data transfers provides a more appropriate solution for resource allocation.Download Thermographie multispectrale haute et basse température : application au contrôle non destructif Ovocyte texture analysis through almost shift-invariant decimated wavelet transformWavelet transforms are superior tools for signal analysis.

However, detecting these events is difficult due to their short duration and low intensities. Taking inspiration from video magnification techniques, we design a workflow for analyzing and temporally spotting subtle motions based on the Riesz pyramid. In addition, we propose a filtering and masking scheme that segments motions of interest without producing undesired artifacts or delays. In order to be able to evaluate the spotting accuracy of our method, we introduce our own database containing videos of subtle motions. Experiments are carried out under different types and levels of noise. Finally, we show that our method is able to outperform other state of the art methods in this challenging task.Download Validation in healthy subjects of a clinical protocol for the evaluation of facial micro-expressions in severely brain injured patients awakening from comaAnnals of physical and rehabilitation medicine, Jul 1, 2018e426 Y.G.
