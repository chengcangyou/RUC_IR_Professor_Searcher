An intensive part 1 introduces students to a range of topics in the context of interaction between academic research and the games industry: user engagement, communication skills, responsible innovation, and inclusive and ethical research. In part 2, students are then mentored (possibly remotely) by industry and academic experts to design and develop a more substantial piece over several weeks -- a game, interactive experience, short film or similar -- that communicates their research to wider audiences.ResearchResearch Interests:See Peter Cowling’s research profile pages including details of research interests, publications, and live grants.
