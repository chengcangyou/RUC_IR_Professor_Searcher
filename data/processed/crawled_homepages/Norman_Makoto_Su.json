I am also an affiliated faculty member in the Institute of Software Research at the University of California, Irvine. I direct the Authentic User Experience Lab (AUX Lab) where we integrate empirical and humanistic methods in HCI to study and design with subcultures. By amplifying and predicting societal concerns and innovations, my research on subcultures envisions designs for members of marginalized and mainstream cultures. With my collaborators, Iâve studied a wide range of âusers,â including corporate tech workers, roboticists, hardcore video gamers, hunters, small farmers, minimalists, Shia photographers, and Irish traditional musicians. My academic interests lie in humanâcomputer interaction (HCI), computerâsupported cooperative work (CSCW), the humanities, ubiquitous computing, organizational/management science, and science & technology studies (STS). I am a program chair (with Nicki Dell and Renee Shelby) for the HCIC 2026 Annual Meeting whose theme is âAIâs Impact on Society.â I was a paper chair (with Xiaojuan Ma, Xinru Page, and Chiara Rossitto) for the 28th ACM SIGCHI Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing (CSCW 2025), the premier venue for research in the design and use of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities, and networks.
