I am also an adjunct professor (Außerplanmäßiger Professor, APL) in the Faculty of Computer Science at Ruhr University Bochum. From 2025 until 2027 I am serving as external examiner for the BSc (Hons) Cyber Security program at University of Mauritius. From October 2018 until December 2023, I have been working on the project EPOQUE – Engineering post-quantum cryptography funded by the European Commission through an ERC Starting grant. Until November 2012 I was a postdoc in the Research Center for Information Technology Innovation and the Institute of Information Science of Academia Sinica. Before that, I was postdoc in the Department of Electrical Engineering of National Taiwan University within the Intel-NTU Connected Context Computing Center. Before that, I was a postdoc in the Institute of Information Science at Academia Sinica. Before that, I was a Ph.D. student in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Eindhoven University of Technology. In January 2011, I completed my Ph.D. at Eindhoven University of Technology in the Coding and Cryptology Group under the supervision of Tanja Lange and Daniel J. Bernstein. In 2006, I finished my Diplom in computer science at RWTH Aachen University at the Institute for Theoretical Information Technology under the supervision of Rudolf Mathar and Michael Naehrig. I am an elected member of the IACR Board of Directors; a member of the IACR CHES Steering Committee and liason to the IACR Board of Directors; a member of the IACR RWC Steering Committee; a member of the organizing committee of the annual Workshop on High-Assurance Crypto Software; and a member of the scientific committee of the annual Summerschool on Real-World Crypto and Privacy. I am a member of the advisory boards of PQShield and SciEngines. I was a member of the advisory boards of Bitmark Inc. and Neutrality.
