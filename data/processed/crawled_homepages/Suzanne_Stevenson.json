I take a highly multidisciplinary approach integrating computational theories and techniques with insights from the fields of linguistics and psycholinguistics. Most of my work is in cognitive science, developing computational cognitive models of how people learn and process language, with a focus on meaning (especially word-level semantics, and pragmatics). My work in CL involves analysis of both social media text and LLMs, informed by cognitive and sociolinguistic principles. Please note that I am not taking on new graduate students at this time.",
