My research is broadly situated at the interface between machine learning, artificial intelligence, and economics. My current research is largely about multi agent system interacting with information: 1) information elicitation and aggregation mechanisms and 2) multi agent learning. I am looking for Ph.D. students who are interested in these (and other related) problems from theoretical and applied angles. Please apply to Computer Science at George Mason University and include my name in your application. Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in any of my work.
