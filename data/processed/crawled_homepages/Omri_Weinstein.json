I am broadly interested in the interplay between information theory, data structures and optimization, in particular, in the role (and limitations) of dynamic data structures and dimensionality-reduction techniques (\"sketching'') in speeding up optimization and search. I was a graduate student at Princeton University and a Simons Society Junior Fellow at Courant Institute (NYU). My research is supported by an NSF CAREER Award on data structure lower bounds. My CV can be found here. Program Committees : FOCS'17 , STOC'20, ESA'21, ISIT'21 . Editorial Boards : Theory of Computing journal (ToC). News : Co-delivering the ICALP'18 Summer School on Data Strucutre Lower Bounds.

This data structure leads to the fastest known LP solver for general (dense) linear programs. Polynomial Data Structure Lower Bounds in the Group Model, with Gleb Posobin, Alexandr Golovnev, Oded Regev, FOCS'20 (Invited to SICOMP special issue ) | ECCC Summary: Proving super-logarithmic data structure lower bounds in the static group model has been a fundamental challenge in computational geometry since the early 80's. We prove a polynomial lower bound on the query time of linear-space arithmetic data structures for an explicit range-counting problem of convex polygons in $\\R^2$. An Adaptive Step Toward the Multiphase Conjecture, with Young Kun-Ko , FOCS'20 | Arxiv Summary: We develop a new tool in information complexity and use it to make progress on Patrascu's Multiphase Conjecture, proving a polynomial (~ \\sqrt{n}) lower bound on weakly-adaptive dynamic data structures . Settling the Relationship of Wilber's Bounds for Dynamic Optimality, with Victor Lecomte , (ESA'20) | Arxiv Summary: We resolve a 35-year open question of Wilber on combinatorial lower bounds for online binary search trees, related to the long-standing Dynamic Optimality conjecture (Tarjan and Sleator, 1985). How to Store a Random Walk, with Emanuele Viola and Huacheng Yu, SODA'20 | Arxiv Summary: We study the problem of \"locally-decodable\" data compression of correlated data, and show that random walks can be stored close to their entropy, while facilitating constant-time decoding of any step on a word-RAM. Lower Bounds for Oblivious Near-Neighbor Search, with Kasper Green Larsen, Tal Malkin and Kevin Yeo, SODA'20 | [Arxiv] Summary: A quadratic improvement over the highest unconditional lower bound for oblivious (secure) near-neighbor search in dynamic settings. Data Structure Lower Bounds Imply Rigidity, with Zeev Dvir and Alexander Golovnev, STOC'19 | [ECCC] Summary: We prove a new relationship between additive and multiplicative low-rank factorizations of a matrix, and use it to show a new connection between static data structure lower bounds and matrix rigidity. Local Decodability of the Burrows-Wheeler Transform, with Sandip Sinha, STOC'19 | [ECCC] , (Invited to Dagstuhl seminar on \"25 Years of BWT\") Summary: We show how to compress strings using their BW transform so that each character can be decoded locally, and use our data structure to achieve an exponential speedup for compressed pattern-matching on strings.

The Minrank of Random Graphs, with Alexander Golovnev and Oded Regev, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory (preliminary version in RANDOM'17) | [ECCC] Summary: We settle the problem of linear index coding over random knowledge graphs, by proving a tight (\\Theta(n/lgn)) bound on the minrank of random Erdos-Renyi graphs. Amortized Dynamic Cell-Probe Lower Bounds from Four-Party Communication, with Huacheng Yu, FOCS'16 | [ECCC] Summary: We develop a new techniques for proving amortized dynamic data structure lower bounds (through a new nondeterministic communication model), and use it to settle the complexity of dynamic weighted 2D range counting. On the Communication Complexity of Approximate Fixed Points, with Tim Roughgarden, FOCS'16 | [ECCC] Summary: We prove the first communication lower bounds on the 2-party problem of computing approximate fixed-points of a composition of two Lipschitz functions f*g. Our \"geometric lifting\" technique was subsequently used to settle the important open problem of distributed computation of approximate Nash equilibria. An Improved Upper Bound for the Most Informative Boolean Function Conjecture with Or Ordentlich and Ofer Shayevitz, ISIT'16 | [ECCC] Summary: We improve the previously best known lower bound on the highest \"correlation\" a Boolean function can have with a noisy binary string, relating hypercontractivity to mutual information. Distributed Signaling Games with Moran Feldman and Moshe Tennenholtz, ESA'16 | [Arxiv] Summary: We introduce a more realistic model of \"signaling\" in auctions where agents have knowledge on the underlying prior value.

Woodruff, ICALP '15 [ECCC] Summary: We settle the simultaneous communication complexity of multiparty (NIH) set disjointness and use it to prove an essentially tight lower bound on streaming frequency moments.
