I direct the Signal Kinetics group which invents new wireless and sensor technologies to interconnect, sense, and perceive the physical world in ways that were not possible before. Our technologies aim to address complex problems in networking, health monitoring, robotics, and ocean IoT. My research has led to multiple startups. I am currently co-founder of Cartesian Systems, a startup that aims to sense the physical world at an unprecedented scale and precision. Prior to that, my PhD research on wireless sensing (ACM SIGMOBILE Dissertation Award) led to Emerald Innovations, whose devices are used for remote health monitoring of thousands of patients. I have received various honors for my work, including being named as one of the world's top 35 innovators under 35, a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum, and the ACM SIGMOBILE Rockstar Award. My research was named as one of the 50 ways MIT has transformed computer science, and one of the 103 ways MIT is making a better world. I have had the honor to present my research to multiple heads of state, including demoing to President Obama at the White House. My research has also been broadly featured in public media, and videos featuring my work have reached over 25 million people. Before joining MIT as faculty, I received my Masters (2013) and PhD (2016) in Computer Science from MIT and my Bachelors (2011) from the American University of Beirut. Interested in joining my research group? You can find information on how to apply for MS/PhD, MEng, postdoc, UROP, and software/hardware/ML engineer positions here. Interested in joining my startup? We have openings for full-time ML scientists, engineers, and interns (grad & undergrad) at Cartesian. Research Overview My team's current research on wireless and sensor technologies focuses on four main areas: Ocean IoT: including batteryless networking, underwater GPS, backscatter theory, underwater-to-air communications, battery-free wireless cameras, and underwater AI. Robot/Drone Perception+Manipulation: including RF-Visual reinforcement learning, mechanical search, and drone localization/navigation (with millimeter-wave backscatter tags). Mixed/Augmented Reality: via X-ray vision headsets. Millimeter-wave Imaging: for non-line-of-sight 3D reconstruction and indoor scene reconstruction. My past research includes: Seeing through walls with WiFi: including 3D tracking, gesture recognition, and reconstructing human figures through walls. Smart homes that measure vital signs including breathing, heartbeats, micro-cardiac events, emotions, and stress levels. Batteryless micro-implants for in-body connectivity, sensing, self-reconfigurabiling with security/privacy. RFID (and RFID-vision fusion): localization, tracking, food/liquid sensing, drone-based inventory, reinforcement learning, robotic picking, and augmented reality. Finally, stories behind my research appeared in a poscast interview (with MIT's president, Sally Kornbluth), an MIT News profile (junior faculty journey) and IEEE Spectrum (PhD research). Recent News Check out my latest talk about our research on underwater IoT (SIGCOMM'25): Teaching a new class on wireless and mobile sensing in Fall 2025. We invented mmNorm: a new way for millimeter-wave imaging (3D reconstruction) via surface normal estimation: Our paper won the Best Paper Runner-up and the Best Poster Award at ACM MobiSys'25. Check out this video explainer and demo: Check out MiFly, a new system that enables drone self-localization using millimeter-wave tags (INFOCOM'25) [MIT News story] Gave a keynote at the National Science Foundation on how to pitch your research (tailored to junior faculty). My PhD student Tara Boroushaki is joining Yale as an Assistant Professor (and recruiting PhD students + postdocs for her lab). Curated the World Economic Forum's Strategic Intelligence on Internet of Things. Our startup Cartesian received the highly selective NSF SBIR Phase II Award. Looking to serving on the Advisory Board of the recently-launched Dubai National University. Named as Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum. Named Great Arab Mind by HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, VP of UAE and ruler of Dubai (Khaleej Times, The National).
