Previously I was a Research Assistant Professor at the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago. I recevied my Ph.D. in Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles, where I was advised by Professor Quanquan Gu. Prior to that, I obtained my MS in Statistics at University of Washington. My research interests are broadly in machine learning, including privacy and security in machine learning (e.g., privacy risks in large models), collaborative learning (distributed and federated leanring), optimization for machine learning, low-rank matrix recovery, and high-dimensional statistics. [07/2023] I gave a talk on \"On the Still Unreasonable Effectiveness of Federated Averaging for Heterogeneous Distributed Learning\" in FL-ICML 2023. [06/2023] We are oragnizing a workshop on New Frontiers in Federated Learning (Recent Theoretical Advances & Practice) at TTIC on September 8-9, 2023. You can register here! [03/2023] I am serving as an area chair for NeurIPS 2023.
