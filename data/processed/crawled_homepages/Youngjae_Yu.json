Before joining Yonsei, I was a researcher at the Allen Institute for AI working with Yejin Choi. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Seoul National University, advised by Gunhee Kim. My research focuses on the seamless adaptation of web, virtual, and real-world data to enhance commonsense reasoning capabilities in embodied agents, while advancing multimodal large language models that are not only capable of understanding but also socially responsible. Along the way, I’ve been honored with the Best Paper Award at NAACL 2022, Outstanding Paper Awards at EMNLP 2023 and ACL 2024, as well as the Okawa Foundation Research Grant.
