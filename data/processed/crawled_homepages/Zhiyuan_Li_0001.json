Recent focus of his group in this area is on programming interfaces and compiler support for the development of innovative parallel software, targeting both large scale high-end systems and multicore microprocessor chips. In recent years, his group has also designed and implemented compiler-based programming environments and run-time systems for resource-constrained distributed systems such as mobile devices, embedded systems and wireless sensor networks, improving their energy efficiency, reliability and maintainability. Li received a National Science Foundation Research Initiation Award and a National Science Foundation Career Award in 1992 and 1995, respectively. He was named by Purdue University as a University Faculty Scholar for the years of 2005-2010. Li has served as a program committee member for many international conferences sponsored by IEEE and ACM. He is Program Chair for ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBEG Conference on Languages, Compilers, and Tools for Embedded Systems (LCTES) in 2007. He co-chaired the International Workshop on Languages and Compilers for Parallel Computing in the years of 1997 and 2004 respectively. Selected Publications Z.
