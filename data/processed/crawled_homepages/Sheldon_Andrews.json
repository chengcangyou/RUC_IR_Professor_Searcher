(Electrical and Computer Eng.) University of Ottawa 2007 B.Eng. (Computer Engineering) Memorial University 2004 I am an Associate professor of Software and IT Engineering at the Ãcole de technologie supÃ©rieure and an Adjunct professor of Computer Science at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. I was previously a visiting researcher at Roblox Research. My research interests include real-time physics simulation, 3D character animation, motion capture, simulation of articulated mechanisms, computational contact mechanics, and measurement based modelling for virtual environments. A complete list of my publications, posters, talks, and demos is available here.
