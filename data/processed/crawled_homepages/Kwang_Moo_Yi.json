My ultimate goal is to improve the quality of human life through smarter vision systems. Towards this goal, I advance Computer Vision in various levels with Machine Learning as the main tool. With the arrival of the Deep Learning revolution, Computer Vision algorithms have become ever more effective, but there is still a lot more in the field to benefit from this advancement. More specifically, my core research interests lie in Visual Geometry, with the eventual goal of understanding the local environment, adapting to it, and acting within it. This could mean autonomous vehicles, drones, robot, but also Augmented and Mixed reality applications. Hopefully, our methods can lead to a better world. News 3.
