Publications Software Research Students Other scientific activities Teaching Miscellaneous Vitae Publications Software Main research subjects and topics of interest computer arithmetic interval and multiple precision arithmetic floating-point arithmetic: influence and choice of the computing precision, roundoff errors verification of floating-point computations for linear and nonlinear problems global optimization (interval arithmetic) and its parallelization Students While in Lille, I worked with Benoît Planquelle, former PhD student at LIFL and now computer scientist at the Rectorat de Lille, Nicolas Baeyens, former graduating student in Applied Math. at USTL and now mathematics teacher, Sébastien Czech, former graduating student in Computer Science at USTL. I also worked on the parallelization of automatic speech recognition with Yahya Ould Mohamed El Hadj, former PhD student at University Mohamed 1st, Oujda, Morocco, co-directed with E.M. Daoudi, within the framework of the European contract INCO-Keep In Touch Development of Parallel Algorithms for Irregular Problems. He is now Professor in Doha, Qatar. Work on interval analysis and global optimization has been done with Jean-Baptiste Verchay for the implementation of Remes' algorithm using arbitrary-precision floating-point arithmetic, (Master in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, summer 2003), Sylvain Chevillard on the evaluation of the error and complementary error functions erf and erfc, with correct rounding, using arbitrary-precision floating-point arithmetic (3rd year in Computer Science, summer 2003), Nathalie Dessart on solving linear systems of equations with arbitrary-precision interval arithmetic (Master in Computer Science, spring 2004), Xavier Roche on the comparison of existence theorems for the solution of nonlinear equations: Kantorovich, Miranda... (3rd year in Computer Science, summer 2004). Francisco José Cháves has worked for his PhD thesis on the implementation and certification of Taylor models using the formal proof assistant PVS (in French). His supervisors were Marc Daumas and myself. This PhD thesis took place in the Mathlogaps framework, a multi-participant Early Stage Research Training Site in MATHematical LOGic and APplicationS (2004 - 2008). Francisco José Cháves now works with Escuela Colombiana de Ingeniería and Lifit, Bogotá, Colombia. Hong Diep Nguyen has defended his PhD thesis (18 January 2011) entitled Efficient algorithms for verified scientific computing: numerical linear algebra using interval arithmetic under the supervision of Gilles Villard and myself. After a postdoc at UC Berkeley with Jim Demmel and a position as consultant in the Silicon Valley, he is now head of software architects for a start-up in California. David Pfannholzer has worked on a PhD thesis from end 2009 to 2011 under the supervision of Florent de Dinechin and myself. Philippe Théveny has defended his PhD thesis in October 2014 entitled \"Numerical Quality and High Performance in Interval Linear Algebra on MultiCore Processors\", with problems originating from linear algebra. He is now working for the finance branch of the Swiss Post.
