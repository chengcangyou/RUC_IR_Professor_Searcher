I studied Computer Science for 5 years (UPV/EHU). And a Master in Natural Language Processing (UPV/EHU). Luckily I could do both in Basque, my mother language. I did my PhD at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) at the IXA NLP group. After that, I was a postdoc and later Assistant Professor at the University of Copenhagen at the Centre for Language Technology (CST). My main research interest is the automatical analysis of poetry in English, especially stress patterns. But wait, can computers analyze poetry? Yeah! They can! Some researchers started working on it in the early 80s with interesting contributions. Nowadays we apply current techniques to these problems. Apart of my main research line, I also like the generation of language, computational morphology/phonology and finite-state methods.
