Our research can be divided into three main themes: (1) Scientific Computing and Machine Learning for Dynamic Environmental and Engineering Systems; (2) Optimal Routing of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles; and (3) Computing for Social Good. We develop, implement and apply theories, numerical methods, and scientific machine learning and artificial intelligence models in all areas. #Education #Experience #Research #Recognition #Contact #Publications #Opportunities #Teaching/Skill Development #Recording (YouTube) of Recent Lectures #Photographs Curriculum Vitae News [Dec 2024] Our research featured on IISc Main Website here.

Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Geosciences Development and application of ML and DL algorithms for Ocean Modeling, Remote Sensing, Environmental Analysis, Ecology Studies, Monsoon Forecasting. Autonomous Underwater Vehicles Combining state of the art environmental state forecasts (ocean, atmosphere, traffic etc.) with AI/ML algorithms, PDE solutions and GPU Computing. Data Assimilation Combining Models and Data for Geosciences and Climate Studies. Uncertainty Quantification Probabilistic predictions and optimization utilizing dynamic stohcastic model order reduction schemes (e.g., Dynamically Orthogonal Field Equations) Current Projects Probabilistic Regional Ocean Predictions Physics Constrained Neural Architecures and Representation Learning Time Series Analysis and Forecasting of Environmental Data Fast and Scalable Algorithms for On-Board Routing of AUVs and Ships in Stochastic, Dynamic Oceans Computational Epidemiology Non-intrusive Polynomial Chaose Gaussian Mixture Model Filtering Deep Learning for Automated Feature Detection from Satellite Images AI for Social Good: Agent-Based Modeling And Reinforcement Learning for Fisheries Management and Wildlife Conflict Resolution #Top Opportunities Master's and Ph.D. Students We invite students who are interested in any of the following topics: numerical solution of stochastic partial differential equations, uncertainty quantification, Bayesian and deep learning of dynamical systems, fluid dynamics of the atmosphere and oceans, and path planning of autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments. Summer Interns We host only the following type of summer interns: (a) Selected through the Indian Academy of Sciences Summer Research Fellows Program; (b) as part of existing collaboration with PIs; (c) candidates who demonstrate exceptional coding skills above and beyond coursework and online self learning. JRF Applications invited for project assistant positions in developing deep learning solutions for autonomous underwater vehicle routing. See ad here. JRF/SRF/Post-Doctoral Applications invited for JRF/SRF/post-doctoral positions in ocean modeling (ROMS). Required Skills: Geoscience Data Handling, Interest in running ocean models. See ad here. General word of advice: Generic emails stating that you have completed a particular online course does not inspire confidence in professors. It is better to share the git repository of particular projects that you worked on. Faculty around the world recieve 100s of emails from Indian students on a weekly basis and most do not read because all emails look the same. Please improve your skills and show evidence (in the form of code!) that you are skilled. Also remember when you send the same email to everyone that faculty in the same department/institute talk to each other!!! #Top Teaching Courses at CDS, IISc UMC 301: Applied Data Science and Artificial intelligence (AUG Term; 2024) DS 211: Numerical Optimization (AUG Term; 2019-2023) DS 392: Environmental Data Analytics (JAN Term; 2020-2023) Courses at DSBA M.Tech (Online), IISc DA 204-O: Data Science in Practice (AUG Term 2023) - I will not be offering this course henceforth due to a rule change at IISc.
