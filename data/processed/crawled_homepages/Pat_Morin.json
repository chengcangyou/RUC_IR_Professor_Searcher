Current Research Dr. Morin’s recent research has focused on graphs with a special focus on the structure of planar and near-planar graphs. This work has lead to the nascent field of graph product structure theory that has been used to resolve a number of longstanding open problems on planar graphs related classes of graphs. Biography Dr. Morin has had a long connection with Carleton University, receiving both his master’s degree in 1998 and his Ph.D. in 2001 from the university’s School of Computer Science. He began teaching as an assistant professor at Carleton University in 2002 and has been a professor of Computer Science at the University since 2013. Dr. Morin co-founded the Journal of Computational Geometry and served as a managing editor for 14 years. His open-content textbook, Open Data Structures, is used as a primary or supplementary text at over 50 North American Universities.
