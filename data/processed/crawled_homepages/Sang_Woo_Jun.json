I have earned my B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Seoul National University (2010). Research Interests My research is in innovative system architectures for low-cost high-performance computing. My two prominent tools right now are Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) and reconfigurable hardware accelerators. Software Distributions libsortreduce Library implementing the Sort-Reduce algorithm for sequentializing random updates into secondary storage, introduced in the GraFBoost paper. GraFBoost / BigSparse Graph analytics platform for handling very large graphs quickly using secondary storage, built using libsortreduce. BluespecPCIe High-performance PCIe library for the Xilinx 7 series FPGAs in the Bluespec language, including hardware core and software library.
