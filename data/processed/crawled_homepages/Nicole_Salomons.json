My research focuses on developing robots that shape human interactions in complex and dynamic environments throughout day-to-day tasks. I do this by building robots that create user models and give personalized feedback for long-term skill acquisition. Additionally, I study different ways that robots can positively influence people. ​ I am currently looking for bright and motivated students interested in doing a Ph.D. in Human-Robot Interaction with me at Imperial.
