My goal is to make learning programming more accessible to all. My current research interest is in if, when, and how we can apply educational psychology principles like worked examples, subgoal labels, modality, and cognitive load to the computing discipline, specifically in learning how to program. I am actively engaged in broadening participation in computing knowledge for all. My current position allows me to prepare pre-service and in-service teachers learn about computing. I am a member of CSforAll and ACM SIGCSE. I am on the ACM Education Board, the AP CS A Development Committee, Associate Editor of Transactions on Computing Education (TOCE) and co-Editor-in-Chief for EngageCSEdu. ​MY CVPAPERSRESEARCHbottom of page",
