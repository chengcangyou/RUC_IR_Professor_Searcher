Williamson is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University.  He received his Ph.D. in computer science and engineering from The Ohio State University, a M.S. in electrical engineering from Drexel University and his B.E.E. from the University of Delaware. Prior to earning his Ph.D., he was a Member of the Engineering Staff at Lockheed Martin. He previously was an Assistant Professor and briefly an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Indiana University. Expertise He is the director of The Audio, Speech and Perceptually-Inspired Research (ASPIRE) group. The groups overarching goal is to develop intelligent sound-processing algorithms that continually learn from user and environmental data in real-world environments, while also preserving user privacy. The groups work has been externally supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Defense, and the Toyota Research Institute (TRI), to name a few. Dr. Williamson is the recipient of two NSF awards, including an NSF CRII and NSF CAREER award. Dr. Williamson and The ASPIRE Group conduct interdisciplinary research in the areas of machine (deep) learning, signal processing, psychoacoustics and hearing science. More specifically, they collectively work on projects in the areas listed below: noise removal and reduction for speech data data-driven perceptual speech assessment auditory attention detection audio privacy",
