My research interests primarily lie in computer networks, specifically in datacenters and low-latency networks, software-defined networking, and network hardware. I have secondary interests in architecture and hardware design. I received my Ph.D. from Purdue University in August 2015. I spent the summer and fall of 2012 at Google on datacenter congestion control and load balancing. I worked as a senior design designer at Nvidia between 2004 and 2008 when I designed the memory controller for the first unibody MacBook Air (see this this newspaper clip!). I got my bachelorâs degree from BITS, Pilani (India). Aside from research and teaching, I enjoy playing tennis and reading books. I live in Chicago with my wife Bhairavi Swaminathan. Bhairavi is a researcher at UIC and her work is in molecular biology and genetics. I maintain a code repository as well as a LinkedIn page.
