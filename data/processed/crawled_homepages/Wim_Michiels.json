An overview of developed software tools, including the package TDS-CONTROL, can be found here. Science Communication What are time-delayed dynamical systems? Why are they of interest? Why are they challenging to analyze and control? What kind of methods and tools do we develop? Do they find application in engineering problems? Take a look at the following webpage.
