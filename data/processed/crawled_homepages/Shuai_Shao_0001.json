Before that, I was a postdoc at the University of Edinburgh, and a postdoc and junior research fellow at the University of Oxford. I got my Ph.D., an M.A. in Math, and an M.Sc in CS from the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where I was fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Jin-Yi Cai. I got my B.Sc. degree in the HUA Loo-Keng talent program in mathematics (honors program) from the School of the Gifted Young, USTC. Research Interests My research interests lie in theoretical computer science. Currently, I focus on the complexity classification of counting/decision/optimization problems in the Holant (also known as the edge-CSP) framework. I am thrilled to explore the connections between Holant problems and quantum theory. I am also interested in approximate counting algorithms and their connections with the phenomenon of phase transitions in statistical physics. I am glad to work with self-motivated students with strong background in theoretical computer science, statistical physics, quantum theory, and/or any fields of mathematics. Send me an email if you are interested in doing an undergraduate project (å½å/å¤§ç ) or a master/PhD thesis with me.
