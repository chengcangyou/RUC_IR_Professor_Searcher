Professor Yan's research combines traditional and modern solutions. He enjoys working with mathematics and physics to solve appearance modeling, real-time ray tracing and sampling, large-scale scene aggregation, wave optics and general light transport algorithms. He also actively explores neural aided rendering techniques, exploiting the power of AI on difficult rendering problems, such as neural BRDFs, denoising, appearance synthesis, multiple scattering inference, generative post-processing, super-resolution and frame generation. Email Share Prior to joining MBZUAI, Professor Yan served as an Associate Professor of Computer Science at UC Santa Barbara, where he was Co-Director of the MIRAGE Lab and an affiliated faculty member in the Four Eyes Lab. He has also held roles as a Visiting Professor at NVIDIA and Research Consultant at Intel. His research focuses on photorealistic rendering in computer graphics, with a world-leading publication record at ACM SIGGRAPH. Professor Yan has introduced novel research directions such as detailed appearance modeling, while also contributing to practical advancements, including frame generation technologies for video games. rofessor Yan's contributions have earned wide recognition, including the ACM SIGGRAPH Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award, multiple Best Paper Awards, and association with several Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects, granted to films that explicitly adopted his research. In addition to his research, Professor Yan is deeply committed to education. He is the creator of the popular online courses GAMES101 and GAMES202, which have reached millions of learners and helped broaden access to computer graphics education worldwide.
