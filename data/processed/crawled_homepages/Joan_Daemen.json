Currently I'm head of the DiS group. Until October 2018, I worked near Brussels, Belgium as a security architect and cryptographer for STMicroelectronics (2003-2018), previously Proton World (1998-2003), previously Banksys (1996-1998), all that time in the security engineering group led by Yves Moulart. Before that I worked shortly at Bacob Bank (1996) in Brussels as a security architect and I spent one year in IT support at J&J (1995-1996) on the Janssen site in Beerse, Belgium. I did a PhD on the design of symmetric cryptography at COSIC in Leuven from 1988 until 1995. Grants Early 2018 I was awarded an ERC advanced grant for my research proposal ESCADA on the foundations of security in symmetric crypto. This has started in October 2018 and ended in September 2024. With Bart Mennink, then Radboud, now Universiteit Maastricht, I have received mid 2018 an NWO TOP grant for our research proposal related to the design of symmetric crypto optimally exploiting available multipliers. This project has started in August 2019 and ended in February 2024. Additionally I received some funding from industry for a project on lightweight cryptography and one on low-latency crypto and I'm part of some consortia leading to some more PhD students.

Anna Guinet: ESCADA, side channel attacks and countermeasures. Anna abandoned her PhD at Radboud in 2021 and started another one at Ruhr University in Bochum under the supervision of Tim GÃ¼neysu, Ruhr University, Bochum. Former postdocs: Christoph Dobraunig: Design and analysis of symmetric cryptography. Yann Rotella: ESCADA, design and analysis of symmetric cryptography. Tingting Cui: design and analysis of symmetric cryptography. Lorenzo Grassi: ESCADA, design and analysis of symmetric cryptography. Shahram Rasoolzadeh: SCALAR, design of symmetric crypto optimally exploiting available multipliers. Silvia Mella: analysis and design of lightweight symmetric cryptography. Teaching I teach and coordinate two bachelor computer security courses here at Radboud University: Computer Security (6ec) and Introduction to Cryptography (6ec). The former I teach together with Simona Samardjiska and Christine Utz and the latter with Durba Shatterjee. I teach one master course in the Radboud cybersecurity master specialization: Cryptology (6ec), together with Simona Samardjiska who is course coordinator. I accompany internships, bachelor and master theses in my own specialization but also in other domains of cryptography and information security. (top) Last modified: January 11, 2025",
