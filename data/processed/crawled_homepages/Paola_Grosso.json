Paola Grosso Full Professor Member of the Multi Scale Networked Systems group(MNS) Scientific Director of the Informatics Institute(IvI) I am a computer scientist, with a passion for everything networking. I research the emerging architectures that can support the operations of the future Internet. In particular I focus on the delivery of secure and sustainable network services across multiple domains, one of the major challenges in networking. Device programmability and virtualization play in this field an ever increasing role in designing networks. My research tackles the new questions that emerge from studying the interplay of these novel capabilities.
