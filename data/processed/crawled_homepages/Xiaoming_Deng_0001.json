Oct. 2020, our paper \"Weakly-supervised Learning for Single Depth based Hand Shape Recovery\" has been accepted by TIP. Short Bio Xiaoming is currently a Professor at Bejing Key Laboratory of Human-computer Interactions, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). He obtained his Ph.D. degree from National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR), Institute of Automation, CAS in 2008. After that, he was a postdoctoral research fellow at Institute of Computing Technology, CAS. He has also worked at Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering in National University of Singapore (NUS) as a research fellow in 2012-2013. He is a member of IEEE. His main research topics are in computer vision, and specifically related to capturing and synthesizing high-quality 3D/2D human gestures, designing gesture-based user interface, and understanding 3D/2D scene. He received the K.C.Wong post-doctoral fellowship award in 2009. See also a complete CV Looking for PostDoc, Ph.D. and Master graduate students, and RAs to work on computer vision. Interested candiates can directly send resume to me. (This web page last updated on April, 2023.)",
