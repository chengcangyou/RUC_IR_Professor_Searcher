I have also applied these techniques to solve chronology problems in archaeology. Chronolog: A tool for computer-assisted chronological research. Tools: The Babylon project The Expand, Enlarge and Check algorithm (for the safety properties of WSTS). The CSC tool for the computation of the coverability set of Petri nets The LavaBDD library implementing the LVBDD datastructure The MightyL tool that enables automata-based verification of the MITL logic.
