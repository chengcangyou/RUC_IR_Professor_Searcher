Road, Kolkata 700108 INDIA Email: debrup(at)isical(dot)ac(dot)in Welcome to my home page. I work on cryptology; more specifically I am interested in provably secure symmetric encryption schemes. Also I am interested in efficient implementations of cryptographic schemes in both software and hardware. Previously I used to work on neural networks and pattern recognition. Still I do continue to work on them, but I spend more time on cryptology now. If you want to know more about my research you can see my publications page.
