Other degrees include an Executive MBA from Kellogg (Northwestern University) and HKUST in 2002, and a BS in Computer Engineering from the University of California at San Diego (Revelle College departmental award, cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa) in 1984. I have been a visiting researcher at Columbia University in 1995-96, Bell Laboratories in 1995, and the Technische UniversitÃ¤t MÃ¼nchen (Munich, Germany) during 1986-87. In December 2011, I was selected by the Association for Computational Linguistics as one of only 17 scientists worldwide to be awarded the honor of founding ACL Fellow, with a citation for \"significant contributions to machine translation and the development of inversion transduction grammar\" which pioneered the integration of syntactic and semantic models into statistical machine translation paradigms. I have served as Associate Editor of Computer Speech and Language, AI Journal, and ACM Transactions on Speech and Language Processing, and on the Editorial Boards of Computational Linguistics, Machine Translation, and Journal of Natural Language Engineering. I also served as Chair of IWSLT 2019, Area Co-Chair for ICLR 2020, ACL 2019, EMNLP 2016, NAACL HLT 2016, IJCAI 2015, ACL 2013, and IJCNLP 2013, Chair of IWSLT 2012, Co-Chair for EMNLP-2004, and the Organizing Committee of ACL-2000 and WVLC-5 (SIGDAT 1997), as well as the Executive Committee of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL). In 2007 I initiated the ongoing annual SSST workshop series on Syntax, Semantics, and Structure in Statistical Translation. South China Morning Post has a nice overview of my accomplishments, activities, and approaches. In 2015 Debrett's named me as one of the 100 most influential figures of Hong Kong, in the area of science. In 2019, Google named me as one of eight inaugural members of its AI Ethics council, ATEAC (Advanced Technology External Advisory Council). Research interests Artificial intelligence; human language and music technology; computational linguistics; natural language processing; machine translation; machine learning; neural networks; data science; cognitive models of human language and communication; multilingual computing; language modeling; speech recognition; language acquisition; dialog systems; information retrieval; knowledge management; evolution of language and music; computational musicology; computer music. For machine learning of the relationships between musical languages, we received the ICMC Best Presentation Award from the International Computer Music Association in 2015. For machine learning of the relationships between written and spoken languages, milestone successes pioneered by my statistical machine translation (SMT) research group include: the first unstructured SMT models on very different languages 1993â Chinese/English alignment 1994â Chinese/English statistical machine translation 1994â Chinese/English phrase/collocation translation learning the first syntactic and tree-structured SMT models 1995â inversion transduction grammar (ITG; any synchronous context-free grammar that is binary, ternary, or inverting) 1995â bracketing ITG (BTG or BITG) 1995â stochastic ITG parameter estimation (EM training) 1996â phrasal SMT (segmental ITG) 1997â projection of monolingual constraints (bilingual constraint transfer; coercion) 1998â SMT with lingustic ITG transduction rules 2005â comparable corpora mining BITG 2009â linear inversion transduction grammar (LITG) 2009â linear transduction grammar (LTG) 2011â preterminalized linear inversion transduction grammar (PLITG) 2012â rule chunking for unsupervised transduction grammar grammar induction 2013â rule segmentation for unsupervised transduction grammar grammar induction the first semantic SMT models 2005â word sense disambiguation for SMT (WSD for SMT) 2007â phrase sense disambiguation for SMT (PSD) 2007â semantic role labeling for SMT training (SRL for SMT) 2009â semantic role labeling for SMT decoding (SRL for SMT) 2013â training SMT against purely semantic frame based objective criteria (MEANT) the first semantic MT evaluation models 2010â human semantic MT evaluation with SRL-for-MTE (HMEANT) 2012â automatic semantic MT evaluation with SRL-for-MTE (MEANT) 2014â cross-lingual automatic semantic MT evaluation without human references (XMEANT) some of this is surveyed in my 2010 chapters \"Alignment\" in CRC Press' Handbook of Natural Language Processing \"Lexical Semantics for Statistical Machine Translation\" in DARPA's Handbook of Natural Language Processing and Machine Translation Our active research projects are internationally funded by the US DARPA BOLT, GALE, and LORELEI programs, the European Union EU-BRIDGE project, and the Hong Kong RGC.
