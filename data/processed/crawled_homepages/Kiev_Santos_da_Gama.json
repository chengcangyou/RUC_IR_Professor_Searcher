I hold a PhD from the University of Grenoble (2011), where I also served as a teaching assistant at Grenoble INP-Ensimag (2008-2011). Research My original background is in Software Engineering and Distributed Systems, with part my research being applied to the context of the Internet of Things and Smart Cities. I coordinate a research group on those topics. More recently I have also been involved on research involving broader topics such as collaborative work, diversity and inclusion in the contexts of software engineering, education and open innovation. These research topics gained traction and we have what we call an advanced research cell. Since 2018 I've been advising undergraduate and graduate research about different diversity dimensions (gender, sexuality, race, disability, neurodivergence) in Software Engineering. Some of my selected publications on that topic include, respectively, an experience report on the (possibly) first course about \"Diversity and Inclusion in Software Engineering\" in a Computer Science Graduate school in Brazil; a chapter in the first open access book on D&I on Software Engineering; and a new perspective on D&I for Requirements Engineering: Kiev Gama, Reydne Santos.

On the Awareness about Diversity and Inclusion being integrated to Requirements Engineering, presented at MO2RE@ICSE'24 I recently started an endeavor in understanding the struggles of neurodivergent (ADHD and Autistic) software developers, with interesting results to share: Kiev Gama, Grischa Liebel, Miguel Goulão, Aline Lacerda, Cristiana Lacerda.

I am part of the program committe of the Software Engineering and Society (SEIS) track at ICSE'25 as well as in other sattelite events and workshops (ICPC, CSEE&T, Designing and SERP4IoT). I joined the organizing committee of the 2025 edition of the Cooperative and Human Aspects of Software Engineering (CHASE 2025) as a social media co-chair. In 2024, I served as co-chair of ICSE's Software Engineering Education and Training track (ICSE2024-SEET). I am serving also as co-chair of the Experience Reports Track in EduComp'23, EduComp'24 and EduComp'25 editions, the Brazilian conference in Computer Science Education, where I served as a program committe member in 2021 and meta reviewer in 2022. I was the conference chair of the 6th International Conference on Game Jams, Hackathons and Game Creation Events (ICGJ'21) and Education Track co-chair of the 35th Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES'21). I have been serving program committee member of international events such as ICPC2024, EASE2024, EASE2023, ICSE2023-SEET and in national workshops and conferences such as the Brazilian Symposium in Software Engineering (SBES), the Brazilian Symposium in Software Achitecture and Reuse (SBCARS) and the Workshop in Informatics Education (WEI).
