My research is mainly focused on secure computation, particularly designing general-purpose protocols for multi-party computation, as well as related tools like oblivious transfer, homomorphic secret sharing and zero-knowledge proofs. Previously, I was a postdoc in Aarhus from 2017 until July 2019. Before coming to Aarhus, I was a postdoc in the Cryptography & Information Security Group at the University of Bristol, where I also studied for my PhD and undergraduate degrees. In November 2015 I completed by PhD, titled Design and Implementation of Secure Multi-Party Computation, supervised by Nigel Smart.",
