His research interests lie primarily in the domain of physical simulation, geometry processing, and optimization-based inverse design for digital fabrication. He develops efficient computational techniques for designing physical objects that meet specific performance goals and can be directly brought into the real world using additive fabrication or CNC machines. He is especially motivated to invent algorithms empowering users to exploit these technologiesâ currently untapped potentials for a broad range of applications, from professional, industrial settings to casual use.
