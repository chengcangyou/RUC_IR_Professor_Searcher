I started my computer science education in NTUA, Athens, Greece. I got my Ph.D. from UCSD, San Diego where I developed Liquid Haskell, as described in my Ph.D. thesis. After that, I spend some time as a postdoctoral fellow at University of Maryland. My research interests include refinement types, automated program verification, and type systems and my goal is to make theorem proving a useful part of mainstream programming. Liquid Haskell is an SMT-based, refinement type checker for Haskell programs that has been used for various applications ranging from fully automatic light verification of Haskell code, e.g., bound checking, to sophisticated theorem proving, e.g., non-interference.
