He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science and Technology from Tsinghua University in 2024, advised by Prof. Peng Cui and Prof. Bo Li, and his B.E. in Computer Science and Technology from Tsinghua University in 2019. During the Spring semester of 2024, he visited the Theory Group at the Department of Computer Science, Duke University, working with Prof. Kamesh Munagala. He received the Best Paper Award at WINE 2025. His research lies at the intersection of machine learning and algorithmic game theory, with a focus on understanding and designing complex ML-driven systems involving strategic interactions among agents. He is particularly interested in characterizing agents’ behaviors and equilibria in environments such as recommendation systems [KDD’25, ICML’23], data markets [ICML’25], and online platforms [WINE’25, WWW’22]. Beyond market design, he is also passionate about the trustworthiness of machine learning algorithms, with work on their generalization capabilities [NMI’24, ICML’22] and algorithmic fairness [KDD’20]. His ultimate goal is to build principled, robust, and socially aware ML systems for real-world decision-making. I am happy to host remote graduate / undergraduate visitors and actively looking for Ph.D. students. If you are interested, please contact me!
