You have arrived at the home of the Earth King (a.k.a. Prithviraj in Sanskrit). You see a plaque with an inscription below a picture of him at the door. What do you do? >examine plaque It reads: “Well, hello there. I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego - leading the 🧋PEARLS Lab🧋 in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). More info can be found on my group website. I am also a research scientist at Nvidia interested in all things scaling embodied AI. I was previously a research scientist at MosaicML acquired by Databricks. And before that on the Mosaic team in the Allen Institute for AI. I received my PhD in Computer Science from the School of Interactive Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by Professor Mark Riedl as a research assistant at the Entertainment Intelligence Lab. My CV is found here, my list of publication here, and projects here. I am motivated by the question of how to imbue learning agents with the ability to understand and generate contextually relevant natural language in service of achieving a goal. This work lies primarily at the intersection of Machine Learning, especially Reinforcement Learning, and Natural Language Processing. The core theme of my research involves creating trustworthy and responsible language-based AI agents that are able to: (1) interactively gather and align to human preferences via feedback; and (2) build and use neurosymbolic world models that guide the agent’s actions in grounded environments. Your score has gone up by 10 points. You open the door and proceed into the house.
