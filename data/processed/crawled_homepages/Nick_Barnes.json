Conditional Generative Modeling via Learning in the Latent Space, Sameera Ramasinghe, Kanchana Nisal Ranasinghe, Salman Khan, Nick Barnes, Stephen Gould I lead a project with the ANU-Optus Bushfire Research Centre of Excellence to detect Bushfires from Fire-towers. Iâm a lead investigator on a project that is developing computer vision research to assist the visually impaired. We are continuing work on this with our partners at Bionic Vision Techologies, The Centre for Eye Research Australia, The Bionics Institute, and Health@CSIRO. The vision processing for prosthetic vision homepage. See link for some of the media coverage of our 2014 human mobility trials. From 2010 to 2015 this was funded by by the Australian Research Council through Bionic Vision Australia. The Bionic Vision Australia partnership developed an Australian bionic eye implant that can restore a sense of vision to profoundly blind individuals. Vision processing is a key part of this approach. This has now become Bionic Vision Technologies, a start-up completing clinical trials with implanted participants. I am interested in developing algorithms that replicate useful aspects of biological visual performance. This is to develop therapies for vision loss such as retinal implants and assistive devices, as well as to develop better algorithms for computer vision.

This managed fixations across items of interest in a moving scene with an active stereo head, and via fixation with the zero disparity field and a Markov random field approach segmented objects corresponding to the points of interest. Graduated: As part of his PhD Chris McCarthy has developed new models for visual docking from optical flow based on the spherical view field of honeybees. By using the sperhical vision model we are able to construct algorithms that rapidly recover time-to-contact for obstacles in the environment. Graduated: John Lim is using the features of spherical vision to develop new algorithms for recovery of self motion. We have looked at visual navigation using a fixated log-polar camera. Projects have developed corner-based fixation and direction control for docking a fixated object using only visual paramters, specifically, the rotational component of log-polar optical flow. We have also developed a new space variant form of the Hough transform that improves the detection of lines in log-polar images. Corner tracking for a simple corner under robot motion. Corner tracking in an office scene under robot motion. Biography Activities & Awards bars search times",
