I am also the founder and co-director of Urban Computing Lab. I am the recipient of 2012 Malcolm Chaikin Prize for Research Excellence in Engineering, 2013 Discovery Early Career Researcher Award, 2014 Dean's Award for Excellence in Research by an Early Career Researcher, 2018 ARC Future Fellowship, 2018 Monash Student Association Teaching Award, and 2019 Victorian Young Tall Poppy Science Award. I have also won two CiSRA best research paper awards (in 2009 and 2010), two \"one of the best papers of ICDE\" (in 2010 and 2012), and three best paper awards at ICAPS 2020, WISE 2013 and ADC 2010, respectively. I am an Associate Editor of IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE). Some of my other service roles include PC co-chair for ADC 2015, ADC 2016, ACM SIGSPATIAL Workshop ISA 2016 & 2018, and International Workshop on Social Computing (IWSC) 2017, proceedings chair for ICDE 2019 and DASFAA 2015, tutorial chair for APWeb 2017 and publicity co-chair for ACM SIGSPATIAl 2017 & 2018. Research interestsMy research interests lie in the areas of data management, data analytics, cloud computing and edge computing. Specifically, I focus on the application of these technologies in Urban Computing, with a particular emphasis on the development of sustainable transportation systems and smart buildings. By leveraging cutting-edge data management and analytics techniques, my research aims to contribute to the creation of cities that are inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable, in alignment with United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 11. Some examples of my current research projects are: 1) using electric vehicles and bidirectional charging to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, e.g., charging using excess renewable energy and supplying power back to grid/homes when renewable energy is scarce; 2) using big spatiotemporal data collected from smartphones mounted in vehicles to reduce greenhouse gas emissions on roads and improve road safety by automatically identifying risky road conditions and unsafe driving behaviors (this is our ARC Discovery Project 2023); 3) indoor data management for smart buildings, including pathfinding, emergency evacuation, location-based services, mobility analytics etc. to improve the functionality and safety of buildings (this is related to my ARC Future Fellowship Project); 4) using digital twins to reduce carbon footprint of cities and buildings. This includes creating digital replicas of cities and buildings to simulate the impact of various interventions on energy consumption and emissions. If your research aims/interests are similar and you are interested in exploring collaboration opportunities, please reach out to me.
