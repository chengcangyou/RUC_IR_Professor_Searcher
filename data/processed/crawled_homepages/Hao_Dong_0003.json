My current research focuses on embodied AI, large models, reinforcement learning, computer vision and the corresponding open-source system. Our goal is to find the scaling law to create a cost-effective general-purpose robot system. Our work has been recognized as a Best Application Paper Finalist at IROS 2024, the ByteDance Best Mentor Award 2024, the Nomination of Outstanding Young Researcher Paper Award at China Embodied AI Conference (CEAI) 2025, and the Youth Outstanding Paper Award Shortlist at World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) 2025. Additionally, I am fortunate to serve as an Area Chair or Senior Program Committee member for CVPR, NeurIPS and AAAI conferences, and as the Associate Editor of ICRA and Machine Intelligence Research. I received the MIR Outstanding Associate Editor Award. Also, I have been involved in open source AI system for a long time, I have led several open source projects, such as Polar Research Station, TensorLayer and OpenMLsys , and have been recognized with multiple honors, including the Huawei Smart Base - Outstanding Contribution Award conferred by China's Ministry of Education in 2021, the Best Open Source Software Award at ACM Multimedia 2017, and two OpenI Outstanding Project Awards (awarded in 2021 and 2022 respectively). more Before joining PKU, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Imperial College London under the supervision of Yike Guo. Prior to my Ph.D., I received a MSc degree with distinction from Imperial, and a first-class BEng degree from the University of Central Lancashire. Furthermore, I have founded a startup focused on AI-driven hardware between 2012 and 2015.
