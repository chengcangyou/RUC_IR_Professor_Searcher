BE (Hons., First Class) in Electrical and Computer Systems, Monash University, Australia, 2000 PhD, Computer Science, Monash University, Australia, 2003Postdoc Research Fellow, Macquarie University, Australia, 2003-2006Macquarie University Research Fellow, Macquarie University, Australia, 2007-2009ARC Research Fellow, Macquarie University, Australia, 2009-2012 Lecturer / ARC Research Fellow, Monash University, Australia, 2012-2014 Senior Lecturer, Monash University, Australia, 2015-2019 Associate Professor, Monash University, Australia, since 2020 Ron's research introduced structured lattice problems, in particular, the Polynomial-LWE problem (a common variant of Ring-LWE) and established their quantum security foundations and cryptographic applications. He also established the first quantum security foundations for NTRU-based encryption and signature algorithms. Variants of these structured lattice problems and algorithms are now routinely used in practical lattice-based cryptography, including the NIST Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standard algorithms Kyber, Dilithium, and Falcon. He was awarded the ASIACRYPT 2015 best paper award for Rényi divergence based analysis techniques bridging a gap between theory and practice in lattice-based cryptography, which form the basis for practical implementations of lattice-based cryptography. He has over 20 years of research experience in cryptography and information security. He has published more than 80 research papers in international refereed conferences and journals, more than 10 of which have each been cited over 100 times.  He received more than AUD$4M in research and consulting funding,from organisations including Australian Research Council, Data61/CSIRO, and the cybersecurity industry. He has served as Technical Program committee member in numerous top-tier international research conferences worldwide (EUROCRYPT, CRYPTO, ASIACRYPT), has been an editorial board member of journal Designs Codes and Cryptography (2017-present), and consulted in cryptography design for the software industry.Research interestsRon's main research interests are in the design and analysis of cryptographic algorithms and protocols, and the formulation and proof of their security properties. He is especially interested in the area of quantum-safe cryptography and its applications.Monash teaching commitmentDr Ron Steinfeld has experience as the Chief Examiner for the following units in the Faculty of IT: FIT2093 Introduction to CybersecurityFIT5003 Software securityFIT5124 Advanced topics in security Ron has experience as the Lecturer for the following units in the Faculty of IT: FIT2093 Introduction to CybersecurityFIT5003 Software securityFIT5124 Advanced topics in securitySupervision interestsQuantum-safe cryptography (aka post-quantum cryptography)Lattice-based cryptographyHomomorphic encryptionQuantum algorithms and cybersecurity applicationsBlockchain security protocols Expertise related to UN Sustainable Development Goals In 2015, UN member states agreed to 17 global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all.
