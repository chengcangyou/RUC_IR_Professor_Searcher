Research Interests My current research in machine learning focuses on large language models, (inverse) reinforcement learning, imitation learning, trustworthy learning, and algorithmic fairness. In the past, I have worked on representation learning, kernel methods, and optimization. I work on applications in longitudinal cancer treatment, pattern recognition, document analysis, image processing, and any prediction problem that is useful in life. Biography Prior to joining UIC in Nov 2015, I was a Senior Researcher at the Machine Learning Research Group of National ICT Australia (NICTA, now Data61). From April 2010 to September 2012, I was a post-doc working with Prof Dale Schuurmans at the Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta.  From March 2006 to October 2009, I was a NICTA-endorsed PhD student of the Research School of Computer Science, Australian National University (ANU), working with Prof SVN Vishwanathan and Prof Alex Smola.  I visited Prof SVN Vishwanathan at the Department of Statistics at Purdue University from February 2009 to March 2010.  From January 2004 to March 2006, I pursued my Master's degree (by research) under the supervision of Prof Wee Sun Lee at the Department of Computer Science, National University of Singapore (NUS). I received my B.E. from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in July 2003. My hometown is Shanghai.
