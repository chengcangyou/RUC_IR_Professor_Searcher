This combines interests in CS theory, computational science, discrete mathematics, and various data science applications. New and Events May 8, 2025. I’m honored to have been selected for an AFOSR Young Investigator Program Award. My proposal was titled “Measuring and Enhancing Resilience in Dynamic Hypergraphs.” Read more about the research here. May 5, 2025. I’m excited to have received a course development grant from the Texas A&M Institute of Data Science (TAMIDS) to develop a new course on “Computational Methods for Network Science.” May 1, 2025. Two papers, co-authored with my student Thomas Stanley, were accepted for publication at ICML 2025, covering learning-augmented algorithms for metric MSTs (joint work with a team at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory), and advances in clustering edge-colored hypergraphs (joint with Blair Sullivan and Alex Crane at the University of Utah). February 20-22, 2025. I attended the ICERM workshop on Fusing Theory and Practice of Graph Algorithms. January 2025. I will be serving as one of the co-chairs for the SIAM Symposium on Algorithm Engineering and Experiments (ALENEX26), to be held in Vancouver, CA in January 2026. The paper submission deadline was July 18, 2025. January 2025. I started serving as one of the officers (specifically, the Secretary) of the SIAM Activity Group on Applied and Computational Discrete Algorithms (ACDA). January 11-15, 2025. Traveled to New Orleans, LA, to attend SODA/SOSA/ALENEX 2025. See here for earlier news and my news page for more detailed updates.",
