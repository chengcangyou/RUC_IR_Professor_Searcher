Prior to that, I have been working as a postdoc with Andreas Zeller at the Software Engineering chair at Saarland University in Germany, and a visiting researcher at Google in Mountain View. I obtained my PhD in the STAR group, led by Mauro Pezzè at the Università della Svizzera italiana in Lugano, Switzerland. My research interests are in the analysis of mobile applications, and software test automation. This is my CV Contact Information IMDEA Software Institute, Campus Montegancedo s/n 28223 Pozuelo de Alarcon, Madrid Spain Phone: +34-91-101-2202 ext 4198 Email: alessandra.gorla [@] imdea.org I am looking for motivated students interested in software engineering. Contact me for internship and PhD opportunities! Analysis of Mobile Apps We have done extensive work on the analysis of mobile app. We compared Android test input generation techniques in our ASE2015 paper. At ASE in 2025 this paper was awarded as the Most Infuential Paper We developed several techniques to identify anomalous apps (ICSE2014, ICSE2015), apps that have privacy issues (PETS2020, MSR2020), and finally we analyzed the iOS ecosystem (FSE2023, SCAM2022) Intrinsic Redundancy We exploit the intrinsic redundancy of software to make Web and Java systems more resilient to failures. We exploited intrinsic software redundancy also to automatically produce test oracles. We also developed a search-based technique to automatically identify intrisically redundant methods in Java classes. More information on FSE2010, ICSE2013, ICSE2014, FSE2014. JSS2021 FSE2024 Test Automation We automate the software testing process on various aspects, spanning from test input generation to the automatic generation of test oraclesISSTA2016, ISSTA2018,ASE2022. We also propose novel metrics to evaluate the quality of test cases ASE2025 and we use test automation techniques to automatically identify when patches are not correct or incomplete.
