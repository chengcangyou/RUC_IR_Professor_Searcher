My work includes research (design and analysis of algorithms, computational complexity, theory and practice of functional programming languages), teaching, and committee service. You may be interested in some flâneries, online writings based on recent creative course offerings. I exhibit occasional flashes of interest in travel, food, wine, coffee, music, books, film, photography, theatre, art, and architecture, though not for long enough to develop any expertise. This site is text-positive and defiantly retro (hand-crafted HTML 1.0). This is what I remember.
