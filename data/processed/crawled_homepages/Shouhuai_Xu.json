Cybersecurity Dynamics can not only deepen our understanding of cyber security from a holistic perspective, but also guide cyber defense operations (including quantitative risk-management and decision making). We are fully aware of the inherent technical gaps and barriers. We see tons of opportunities for researchers across multiple disciplines to closely work together. We look forward to collaborations. The way ahead is exciting!!I’m always looking for motivated students to pursue Honor’s Thesis, MS Thesis and PhD Dissertation research. I’m also looking for motivated and talented Post-Docs to work on exciting and challenging problems.",
