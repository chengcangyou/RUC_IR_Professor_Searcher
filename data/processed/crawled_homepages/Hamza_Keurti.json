Follow Zürich, SwitzerlandETH ZürichEmailGoogle ScholarGithubLinkedInX (formerly Twitter)I am an Assistant Professor of Machine Learning at UM6P College Of Computing. Before joining, I was a PhD student at the ETH Zürich and the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems. I am co-advised by Benjamin Grewe and Bernhard Schölkopf. I held a PhD fellowship at the Max Planck ETH Center For Learning Systems. Prior my PhD, I obtained a Diplome d’Ingénieur (~MEng) at Centrale Paris with a double degree (MSc) in Advanced Computing at Tsinghua University. I worked as a software engineering intern at SLB.My research lies at the intersection of Machine Learning, Geometry and Compositionality. I am interested in learning ``good’’ representations of data which recover the compositional structure of the world. I leverage the interactions of an agent with its environment to learn such representations. In general, I am interested in avoiding the misspecification of models and representation structure in machine learning.News[2024-07] I will be at ICML 2024 to present our work on Stitching Manifolds at the ICML 2024 GRaM Workshop.[2024-06] Our work on Stitching Manifolds has been accepted at the ICML 2024 GRaM Workshop.[2024-05] I am at GITEX Africa to share a panel on Machine Learning and Data Science Opportunities.[2024-02] I am at the UM6P Week of Science to give a talk on Perception Learning from Action.[2023-05] Our work on the Homomorphism AutoEncoder has been accepted at the ICML 2023 conference.[2022-12] Our work on the Homomorphism AutoEncoder won the Best Abstract Award at the NeurIPS 2022 Neurreps Workshop[2022-08] We are presenting (Poster) the Homomorphism AutoEncoder at the UAI 2022 CRL Workshop.[2021-12] We are presenting our work (Oral) on Uncertainty Estimation under Model Misspecification at the NeurIPS 2021 Workshop ``Your Model is Wrong’’.[2021-10] Starting my visit at the MPI for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen, Germany.[2020-09] I am starting my PhD at the ETH Zürich and the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, funded by the Max Planck ETH Center For Learning Systems.",
