Subsequently I worked as a Postdoctoral fellow at the Socially Intelligent Machines lab, Georgia Tech (2010-2011) and the Intelligent Assistive Technology and Systems Lab , University of Toronto (2012-2013). Prior to joining the University of New Hampshire, I was a Research Assistant Professor in the Computer Science department at the University of Massachusetts Lowell . Research The goal of my research is to design and develop innovative robotic technologies to assist people with cognitive and physical impairments. This research domain is formally known as 'Assisitve Robotics'. Assistive robotics is inherently a multi-disciplinary research domain and I am interested in developing AI-machine learning-computer vision algorithms in order to ensure effective interaction of assistive robots with lay humans. There are many algorithmic, engineering, ethical, and social challenges involved with the design and development of autonomous assisitve robots for vulnerable end-users. Working on them gives me a way to say \"Thank You\" for everything I am blessed with!
