Krishnan Assistant Professor, Computer Science & Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology Canada CIFAR AI Chair at the Vector Institute Tier II Canada Research Chair in Computational Medicine I will hire a graduate student in Fall 2026. Apply to the DCS graduate program. See more information on the joining page. Research Direction Data collected from natural phenomena characterize computation occurring within complex processes governed by known and unknown laws. Neural networks are powerful tools that can learn to compress computation happening in nature. My group advances fundamental research in machine learning to understand, identify, and create controllable and reliable artificial intelligence systems. We are currently focused on building neural network models that reason causally, and using them to solve problems in healthcare and biology.
