China Office: Room 1715, Lide Building Email: Phone: (86) 010-62513716 Chinese Homepage (ä¸­æä¸»é¡µ): gsai.ruc.edu.cn/zhewei I am currently Professor and Vice Dean of Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China. I worked as a Professor (Jul 2019 - Jul 2020), and as an Associate Professor (Sep 2014 - Jun 2019) at School of Information, Renmin University of China. I was a Postdoc researcher at MADALGO (Center for Massive Data Algorithmics), Aarhus University, from September 2012 to August 2014, working with Prof. Lars Arge. I was a Postdoc researcher at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, HKUST, from March to August 2012. I obtained my PhD at Department of Computer Science and Engineering, HKUST in March 2012. My supervisor is Prof. Ke Yi. I received my B.Sc. Degree in the School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University in June 2008. Research Interests I lead The ALGO Lab, where our research focuses on developing simple, elegant, and theoretically sound algorithms to tackle critical challenges in Artificial Intelligence and Big Data processing. Our specific areas of interest include: Graph Algorithms and Graph Machine Learning Designing efficient algorithms to process and learn from massive graph structures. Streaming Algorithms and Stream Machine Learning Developing algorithms capable of handling and learning from continuous, real-time data streams. AI for Science Applying graph machine learning to solve complex problems in biology, pharmaceuticals, and other scientific disciplines. AI for Social Science Utilizing large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems to model intricate human social networks. AI for Databases Leveraging machine learning techniques to optimize database systems for enhanced performance and efficiency.
