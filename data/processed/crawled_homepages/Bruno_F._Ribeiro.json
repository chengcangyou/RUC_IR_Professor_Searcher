However, we anticipate that some seats may become available after the initial week of classes since the class is at 9:30am.If you are interested in enrolling, we recommend waiting until after the first week of classes Upcoming talk at the Joint Mathematics Meeting on the Mathematics of Graph Foundation Models: Jan 8th, 2025, 1-2pm.\"As we exhaust sequential data for training LLMs, relational data remains mostly untapped. In this talk we will explore the mathematical challenges and potential solutions for harnessing relational data in foundation models.\" Congratulations to Beatrice Bevilacqua for her 2024 MIT EECS Risiting Stars award.
