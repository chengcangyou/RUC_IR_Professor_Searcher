I'm a member of the editorial board of Digital Investigation. I'm also a member of the Crime Writers' Association - for non-fiction works And I have a page on IMDB because I helped with some TV work. Web philosophy I like simple web pages with minimal \"prettifying\" to confuse things. Distractions If I'm not in my office, I may well be doing something like this. Other information I have a huge footprint on the web. I'm sure you can find lots of information out there. Diary If you want to book an appointment with me - please follow this link. Otherwise, I may be in my office if the calendar below shows that I'm not due to be somewhere else. ----*",
