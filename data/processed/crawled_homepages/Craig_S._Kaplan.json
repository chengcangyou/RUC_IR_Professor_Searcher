Kaplan Professor Computer Graphics Lab School of Computer Science University of Waterloo Mail: csk@uwaterloo.ca Mastodon: @csk Github: isohedral Personal: isohedral.ca I am a Professor in the School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. I'm interested in a broad range of interdisciplinary topics, with a particular focus on interactions between mathematics and art. I use mathematical ideas to create tools and algorithms that generate ornamental patterns, or that empower artists and designers. My work frequently incorporates knowledge from computer graphics, classical and computational geometry, human-computer interaction, graph theory, symmetry and tiling theory, and perceptual psychology. In 2023 I contributed to the discovery of the world's first aperiodic monotiles, settling a longstanding open problem in mathematics. See also my personal website, where I maintain an occasional blog, as well as information about personal art and design projects, software, and recreational topics. I am an associate editor and past editor-in-chief of Journal of Mathematics and the Arts, and a member of the board of the Bridges Organization, which oversees the annual Bridges conference on mathematics and art.
