Tolkien Biographical Sketch Arvind Easwaran is an Associate Professor in the College of Computing and Data Science at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. He received a PhD degree in Computer and Information Science from the University of Pennsylvania, USA, in 2008. Prior to joining NTU in 2013, he has been an Invited Research Scientist at the Polytechnic Institute of Porto, Portugal, between 2009 and 2010, and a Research & Development Scientist at Honeywell Aerospace, USA, between 2010 and 2012. In NTU, he is has led several research projects spanning areas including real-time scheduling, safety assurance for learning-enabled cyber-physical systems and optimization for building energy management. Currently, he is the Chair for the NTU Senate, Assistant Dean (Academic) in the College, and co-Director for the NRF-CREATE program DesCartes on hybrid artificial intelligence (a collaborative initiative with CNRS, France).

Research Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) encompass systems in which the cyber world of computation and communication closely interacts with the physical world of sensors and actuators. These are highly networked and deeply embedded systems such as those found in modern day aircrafts, automotives, factories, medical devices, smart phones, electric grids, etc. From driver-less cars and air traffic management using sense and avoid, to plug-and-play operating rooms and smart electric grids that integrate traditional and renewable energy sources, intelligent automation of an enormous scale is finding its way into many of these systems. Arvind's primary research interests are in the design and analysis of safety-critical and time-critical CPS, with a particular focus on cyber-resource management and safety assurance. The current research themes can be broadly classified as follows: Resource Management and Scheduling Safety Assurance in Learning Enabled Systems For further details, please visit CPS Research Group @ CCDS,NTU.
