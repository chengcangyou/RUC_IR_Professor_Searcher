My research is part of broader efforts in Foundations of Data Science, Machine Learning, and Theory of Computation at Columbia. If you are a (current or prospective) student interested in coming to Columbia and/or working with me on research, or if you are generally interested in getting started in machine learning and/or research, please check this page of frequent answers to questions. My papers can be found by following this link. (See also arXiv, dblp, Google Scholar.) Slides from recent Science Research Fellows Seminar talk People Iâm lucky to be able to work with several outstanding students and postdocs.
