I am an Associate Professor of Empirical Software Engineering at the University of Zurich (UZH), Switzerland, where I lead the Zurich Empirical Software engineering Team (ZEST). My Curriculum Vitae (updated Aug 2024) is available here. My research field is empirical software engineering. My broader vision is to innovate software engineering and support software quality through novel evidence-based methods and tools, also exploiting the large amount of information produced during the software engineering process. I obtained my Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Michele Lanza, working in the REVEAL research group, at the Faculty of Informatics, of the University of Lugano. During my Ph.D. studies, I have been intern twice (2012 and 2013) at Microsoft Research in Redmond, USA, working with Dr. Christian Bird I obtained my bachelor and master degrees in computer science from University of Bologna, also studying one year at the Université Libre De Bruxelles during my Master.
