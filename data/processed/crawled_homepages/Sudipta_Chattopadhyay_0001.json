  "content": "Sudipta Chattopadhyay I work as a Scientist in the Center for Communication and Signal Processing at Temasek Lab at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). I am also an Associate Professor (from Jan 2026) in the School of Science and Engineering at the University of Missouri--Kansas City (UMKC). Together with my research group, I take pride in discovering new and impactful vulnerabilities. My research interests broadly cover the area of Cyber Security, Cybercrime and Forensics, Software Engineering and (Networked) Embedded Systems. One of my key research objectives is to develop rigorous process, technologies and tools for investigating novel attack surfaces and related defenses in complex software systems e.g., wireless communication systems, internet-of-things and machine-learning enabled software systems. Before 2017, I was a post-doctoral scholar at Computer Science division in Saarbrücken, Germany. In Germany, I was affiliated with the Center for IT-Security, Privacy and Accountability (CISPA) and the Software Engineering Chair led by Prof. Andreas Zeller. Before coming to Germany, I was a post-doctoral researcher in the Department of Computer and Information Science in Linköping University, Sweden, where I primarily worked in the Embedded Systems Lab. I have obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore in 2013. Prior to my PhD study, I was working as a Research and Development Engineer in Synopsys for 1.5 years.
