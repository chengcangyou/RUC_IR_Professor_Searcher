I received my PhD. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) in 2022. My research interests are in computer architecture and computer security. In particular, I am interested in microarchitectural attacks, high-performance mitigations, and architecture support for security and privacy.I am looking for graduate students. Please contact me if you are interested in my research.
