I am Assistant Associate Dean of the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) discipline. I received my Ph.D. degree in artificial intelligence from University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand. My research interests include machine learning, evolutionary computation, multiobjective optimization, multimodal optimization (niching), swarm intelligence, data mining/analytics, deep learning, journey planning, math-heuristic methods for optimization. I was an Associate Editor of IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, the journal of Swarm Intelligence, and International Journal of Swarm Intelligence Research. I am the group leader of ECML (Evolutionary Computation and Machine Learning) research group. I am an IEEE Fellow, and an IEEE CIS Distinguished Lecturer (2024 - 2026). I am also a member of ARC (Australian Research Council) College of Experts (2023 - 2026). I was the General Chair for GECCO2024, which was held in Melbourne from 14 - 18 July 2024. My talk (13 November 2024) on \"Adaptive Solution Prediction via Machine Learning for Large-Scale Combinatorial Optimization\" (viewable on YouTube) tells a bit more about my recent research efforts. Two PhD scholarships: We are looking for strong candidates to work on the following two projects: 1) \"AI-Driven Optimisation for Substainable Agriculture in Australia\"; 2) \"Machine Learning for Evaluating Constraints in Optimization Algorithms (closed now). Please email me your academic transcripts, CV, and a short letter as to why you consider yourself the best candidate for this project. Please also attach copies of your two best research publications. Recipient of 2013 ACM SIGEVO Impact Award. A list of past recipients. Awarded 2017 IEEE CIS \"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation Outstanding Paper Award\". Winner of IEEE CEC'2019 Large-Scale Global Optimization (LSGO) competition, Wellington, New Zealand, 11 June 2019 (see the RDG3 algorithm winning the competition). Recognition of Service as GECCO'2024 General Chair. IEEE Fellow (from 2020), \"for contributions to large-scale and particle swarm optimization\". See IEEE Fellow Class of 2020.
