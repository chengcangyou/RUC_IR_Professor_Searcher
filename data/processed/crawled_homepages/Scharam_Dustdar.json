In my current research agenda, I investigate all aspects related to Edge-Computing, Fog-Computing, Cloud Computing, and Human-based Computing as well as AI in the co-evolution of distributed systems for the new decade. My research revolves around all challenges that these new distributed systems have to address. Interested in doing your PhD?
