I am particularly interested in understanding how to best leverage human knowledge in automated tools and how to help human users guide and steer these tools effectively. Prospective students: If you are looking to do a PhD and are interested in working together, please read this and contact me. I worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow at University of California, Los Angeles, advised by Prof. Miryung Kim. I completed my PhD at SMU, advised by Prof. David Lo (My PhD was officially received in May 2023, although I left earlier). Throughout my career, I have been very fortunate to have collaborated with many wonderful researchers. Contact: hongjin.kang [at] sydney.edu.au / kanghongjin [at] gmail.com [Google Scholar] [DBLP] Research Active Learning and AI for Software Engineering. My research primarily focuses on Active Learning for Software Engineering. We have investigated the use of Active Learning for learning code search patterns[TSE 2022, ICSE 2024], analyzed code embeddings [ASE 2019], and AI for program analysis [ICSE 2022 (Poster), TSE 2023, FSE 2022]. Software Supply Chain. To secure the software supply chain, we have built tools employing a range of techniques (e.g., LLMs, fuzzers) that have been deployed by our industrial partners. We analyze vulnerability reports [ICPC 2022, ICSE 2023], detect security fixes [ICSE 2022, TSE 2023], and fuzz libraries to assess vulnerabilities' exploitability [ISSTA 2022] and find bugs (resulting in over 20 CVE IDs). Program Transformation. We developed Coccinelle4J [ECOOP 2019] for Java program transformation, extending the Coccinelle program matching and transformation tool. Coccinelle is widely adopted, including by Linux kernel developers. There are many lessons we can learn from Coccinelle. Building on this, we have worked on the automated migration of deprecated functions [ICSME 2019, ICPC 2020 ERA, EMSE 2022]. Other work include machine learning on code changes/commits [ICSE 2020, SANER 2022] Service I have served on the program committees and reviewer for the following publication venues.
