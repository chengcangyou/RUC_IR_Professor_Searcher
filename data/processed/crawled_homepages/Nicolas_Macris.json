Information theory establishes the limits of communications – what is achievable and what is not. Coding theory tries to devise low-complexity schemes that approach these limits. The group is composed of five laboratories: Communication Theory Laboratory (LTHC), Information Theory Laboratory (LTHI), Information in Networked Systems Laboratory (LINX), Mathematics of Information Laboratory (MIL), and Statistical Mechanics of Inference in Large Systems Laboratory (SMILS).
