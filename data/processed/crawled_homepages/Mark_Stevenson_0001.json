He is a member of the Natural Language Processing group which he joined in 1995. His PhD, on Word Sense Disambiguation, was published as a monograph.He has been Principal Investigator of projects funded by a range of sources including the EU, EPSRC and Google. He was an EPSRC Advanced Research Fellow (2006-2011) and co-ordinator of the EU-funded project PATHS.He has also worked in a range of commercial and academic organisations including Reuters Ltd (where he was involved in the production and dissemination of the widely used Reuters Corpus), Adastral Park (British Telecom’s research lab) and the Center for the Study of Language and Information, Stanford University. Research interests Mark Stevenson’s research focusses on Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval. Topics he has worked on include word sense disambiguation, Information Extraction, plagiarism/reuse detection, lexicon adaptation, cross-lingual information retrieval and exploratory search.His research includes applications of these technologies to a range of areas including biomedical journal articles (interpretation of documents, extraction of information from them and data mining information from corpora), cultural heritage (automatic organisation of corpora, exploratory search interfaces) and software testing (generation of realistic test suites).
