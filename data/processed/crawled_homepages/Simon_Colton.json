The first area will cover the application of well-known AI techniques such as Deep Learning and Markov Models to generative projects, as well as ad-hoc techniques. These will be illustrated with applications in music, the visual arts and video game design, considering issues of human-computer interaction in these domains. The second area will raise and discuss questions around the value of having autonomous and semi-autonomous creative AI systems in society, drawing on philosophy, sociology, psychology and cognitive science, as well as engineering disciplines.
