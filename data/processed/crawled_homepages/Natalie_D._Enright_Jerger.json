I joined the Edward S. Rogers Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2009. I am currently the Canada Research Chair in Computer Architecture and was formerly the Percy Edward Hart Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. I am thrilled to serve as the Director of the Division of Engineering Science from July 1, 2023--June 30, 2028. More information can be found here. Prior to joining the University of Toronto, I received my PhD from the University of Wisconsin-Madison studying Computer Architecture. I was part of the PHARM research group and I was co-advised by Mikko Lipasti and Li-Shiuan Peh. I received my Bachelor of Science degree in 2002 from Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN. My research interests include multi- and many-core architectures, on-chip networks, cache coherence protocols, memory systems and approximate computing. Please see my research page for more details. In 2019, I received the McLean Award from the University of Toronto and was appointed as the Canada Research Chair in Computer Architecture. In 2015, I was awarded an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship and the Borg Early Career Award. I am the recipient of the 2014 Ontario Professional Engineers Young Engineer Medal. In 2012, I received the Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation Early Researcher Award. I recently served as the program co-chair of the 7th Network-on-Chip Symposium (NOCS) and as the program chair of the 20th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA). I am a Distinguished Member of the ACM, Fellow of the IEEE, Fellow of the Canadian Academy of Engineering, and Fellow of the Engineering Institute of Canada. In 2017, I co-authored the second edition of On-Chip Networks with Tushar Krishna and Li-Shiuan Peh. My research is supported by NSERC, Intel, CFI, AMD and Qualcomm. Beyond research, I am also involved in outreach activities for women in computer architecture, including serving as chair of WICARCH. If you are a woman studying or working in the area of computer architecture, please consider joining our group: WICARCH. To actively advance conversations around diversity and inclusion within computer architecture, I have published blog pieces on SIGARCH's Computer Architecture Today looking at gender diversity (with Kim Hazelwood), the climate in computer architecture (with Kelly Shaw) and the new WICARCH initiatives. A broad overview of the efforts I have been involved in can be found here. From 2019-2021, I served as the co-chair of ACM's Council on Diversity and Inclusion. My CV can be found here: CV (updated July 2024) Updates to this website are in progress.

Despite continued device scaling as predicted by Mooreâs Law, building larger and faster single-processor chips has become increasingly difficult due to the power consumption of these systems. Concerns about power consumption have held clock frequencies relatively steady in recent years (compared to the increases enjoyed through the 1990s). Architects are now exploiting growing transistor counts to integrate multiple cores per chip in order to provide increased performance with every new technology generation. In this computing landscape, computation is essentially free; we can build as many arithmetic and logic units (ALUs) as we would like. Despite the ability to integrate an astounding amount of computation on to a chip, we face a number of key challenges. First, doubling the number the compute resources in the form of more cores does not naÃ¯vely result in a doubling of performance. Communication remains a bottleneck to extracting more performance from these systems. Communication is needed in these architectures to feed computational units with data (both from off-chip memory and from other areas on the chip) and to maintain a coherent view of globally shared memory. Second, power consumption remains a significant concern and growing transistor counts have lead to the era of Dark Silicon. Dark Silicon is an operating paradigm in which chips have more transistors than can be simultaneously switched on and off due to power and thermal limitations. To address these challenges, my research group continues to work in on-chip interconnects but has also expanded to make research contributions to energy-efficient design through approximate computing and hardware acceleration to mitigate the impacts of dark silicon. More details on recent and on-going projects can be found below.

This work is designed to be a short synthesis of the most critical concepts in on-chip network design. It is a resource for both understanding on-chip network basics and for providing an overview of state of-the-art research in on-chip networks. We believe that an overview that teaches both fundamental concepts and highlights state-of-the-art designs will be of great value to both graduate students and industry engineers. While not an exhaustive text, we hope to illuminate fundamental concepts for the reader as well as identify trends and gaps in on-chip network research. With the rapid advances in this field, we felt it was timely to update and review the state of the art in this second edition. We introduce two new chapters at the end of the book. We have updated the latest research of the past years throughout the book and also expanded our coverage of fundamental concepts to include several research ideas that have now made their way into products and, in our opinion, should be textbook concepts that all on-chip network practitioners should know. For example, these fundamental concepts include message passing, multicast routing, and bubble flow control schemes.

On-chip networks seek to provide a scalable and high-bandwidth communication substrate for multi-core and many-core architectures. High bandwidth and low latency within the on-chip network must be achieved while fitting within tight area and power budgets. In this lecture, we examine various fundamental aspects of on-chip network design and provide the reader with an overview of the current state-of-the-art research in this field.
