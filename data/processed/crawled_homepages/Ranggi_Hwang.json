We study computer architecture and hardware–software co-design from digital systems and computer architecture up through applications and algorithms. By co-optimizing across these layers, we aim to build high-performance computing platforms for future intelligent systems that are programmable, robust, reliable, secure, and energy-efficient. This end-to-end perspective helps us turn device-level advances into real system impact and practical software.(NOTE) For students interested in undergraduate research internships or those applying to our research group for graduate studies, please send an email with your most recent CV and transcript.(Latest News)[November 8] Our paper titled \"PASCAL: A Phase-Aware Scheduling Algorithm for Serving Reasoning-based Large Language Models,\" has been accepted for presentation at the IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA-32), Sydney, Australia, Feb. 2026. [September 1] The Computer Architecture & Co-Design Research Group (CoCoLab) officially launched at UNIST!Google SitesReport abusePage detailsPage updated Google SitesReport abuse",
