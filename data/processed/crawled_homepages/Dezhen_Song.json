Spatial intelligence is a fundamental ability for robots to perceive their environment and make motion plans to physically interact with it. His research focus includes algorithms for cross-modality perception and learning, robust navigation, scene representation and understanding, and tightly coupled perception and planning. All of the above are built on spatial and motion uncertainty analyses drawn from either explicit geometric/stochastic model-based approaches or data-driven machine learning (ML)-based approaches. Email Share Prior to joining MBZUAI, Professor Song was a professor and associate department head for academics in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&M University. From 2008 to 2012, Professor Song was an associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO). From 2010 to 2014, he was an associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering (T-ASE). Professor Song was a senior editor for IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) from 2017 to 2021 and currently is a senior editor for IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering (T-ASE). He is also a multimedia editor and chapter author for Springer Handbook of Robotics. His research has resulted in one monograph and more than 130 refereed conference and journal publications.
