My research balances both computational challenges and their applications. Besides always aiming at excellence and impacting publications in Computer Science, I am especially interested in inter-, cross-, multidisciplinary research. I see the connection with other areas of knowledge as an opportunity to develop cutting-edge research with high possibilities for impacting directly on economic, social, and environmental aspects. Interests Computer Vision Image Processing Machine Learning Remote Sensing Education Ph.D. in Computer Science, 2013 UniversitÃ© de Cergy-Pontoise (ENSEA, France) & University of Campinas (Unicamp, Brazil) M.Sc. in Computer Science, 2009 University of Campinas (Unicamp, Brazil) B.Sc. in Computer Science, 2006 Universidade Estadual de Mato Grosso do Sul (UEMS, Brazil) Research My research is carried out through the activities of the Patreo laboratory. Take a look at the projects I’m currently involved as Principal Investigator: Deep Representations for Large-Scale Geo-Mapping It aims to address the problem of pattern recognition for the creation of thematic maps via supervised learning in large sets of images from small annotated data sets. Dense Labeling of Remote Sensing Images in the Wild This project address the challenges for the effective use of supervised learning in dense pixel labeling in real-world applications by increasing the robustness of the models. Pattern recognition using small annotated data sets It proposes the development of new approaches to deal with the processing of large sets of images but which have restrictions regarding the number of labeled samples.
