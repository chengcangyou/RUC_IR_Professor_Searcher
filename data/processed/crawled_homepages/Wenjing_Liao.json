I finished my Ph.D. in Mathematics under the supervision of Prof. Albert Fannjiang at University of California, Davis. I was a visiting assistant professor at Duke University and an assistant research scientist at Johns Hopkins University before joining Georgia Tech. I worked with Prof. Mauro Maggioni at Duke and JHU. My research is supported by NSF and DOE,  including NSF CAREER and DOE CAREER awards. Here is my CV. I am looking for motivated students who are interested in deep learning theory, manifold learning, PDE identification and super-resolution in imaging.  Please send me an email if you are interested.
