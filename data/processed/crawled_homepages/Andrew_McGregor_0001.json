I'm a member of the Theory Group and my research is in algorithms and complexity. Specific topics of interest include processing massive data sets and data streams, clustering, approximation algorithms, coding and information theory. Here are my research papers. Prior to UMass, I spent a great couple of years at Microsoft Research (Silicon Valley) and the Information Theory and Applications Center at UCSD. In 2007, I received my Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania. During graduate school, I spent a summer at DIMACS and three summers at the Fundamental Maths Department at Bell Labs. In the dim and distant past, I received the Certificate of Advanced Study in Mathematics (2001) and a B.A. in Mathematics (2000) from the University of Cambridge. Here's text of a short bio, a photo, and a cv. \"We know that five minus four is one But a cloud minus a sailboat Have no idea what it is.\" -- Another Kind of Mathematics, Nichita Stanescu HomePapersTeachingBlog",
