He builds computer vision tools to enable automatic discovery from large-scale data. His research builds large-scale multimodal foundation models for domains with annotation/data constraints. His research also improves these foundation models making them more suitable for discovery, such as better interpretability or uncertainty estimates. In interdisciplinary collaboration with domain experts from climate scientists, crop scientists to fashion anthropologists, he also applies these methods to a diverse set of real-world scientific problems. Email Share Prior to joining MBZUAI, Professor Mall was a postdoctoral research scientist in Computer Science at Columbia University, where he developed interpretable, reliable, and data-efficient methods to enable novel scientific discoveries from visual data. His work has been applied across diverse fields including agriculture, anthropology, archaeology, urban planning, public health, and climate science. He earned his PhD from Cornell University, focusing on building label-efficient foundation models for scientific domains and leveraging them for unsupervised discovery. Professor Mall also co-organizes the CVPR workshop Computer Vision for Science (CV4Science), and his doctoral research was recognized at the WACV 2022 and CVPR 2023 Doctoral Consortium.
