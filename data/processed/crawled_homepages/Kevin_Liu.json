Academic Experience Research Publications Research Interests Google Scholar Teaching Software CV Lab Webpage Associate Professor, Department of Computer Science and Engineering Core Faculty Member, Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior (EEB) Program Faculty Member, Genetics and Genome Sciences (GGS) Program Michigan State University My lab creates new computational methodologies for efficient and accurate comparative genomic analyses – especially in the context of complex evolutionary scenarios – and then connects the resulting insights to phenotype and function. The end goal of our big-data-driven approach is to generate hypotheses that result in new biological and biomedical discoveries. A note to prospective students and postdoctoral researchers: If you are interested in pursuing interdisciplinary research in bioinformatics and computational biology, I'd love to talk to you!
