The main focus of this work is the development of techniques for deriving programs from formal specifications based on the refinement calculus, and the design of tools to support program refinement, but also includes application of formal methods in industrial applications, refinement of logic programs, verification of concurrent systems, and semantics of data models. I have an ongoing joint research project with Mark Moir and others at Oracle's Sun Lab, Boston, on proof methodologies for concurrent algorithms. I also have more general interests in software engineering, including program visualisation, program understanding, program maintenance/evolution and safety-critical systems.
