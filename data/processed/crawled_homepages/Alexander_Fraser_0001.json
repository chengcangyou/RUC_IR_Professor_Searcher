He focuses on addressing data sparsity and integrating linguistic and world knowledge in AI systems. Additionally, he collaborates with language communities to develop technology for their languages. His contributions to natural language processing and machine learning emphasize both theoretical advancements and practical applications.Prof. Fraser acquired his doctoral degree in 2007 at University of Southern California in computer science. From 2007 to 2013 he was at the University of Stuttgart. From 2013 to 2024 he was at LMU Munich, first as a tenured lecturer and then from 2017 as the Professor of Information and Language Processing. He received the ERC Starting Grant in 2014, and an ERC Proof of Concept Grant in 2022. He is Chair for Data Analytics & Statistics at the Technical University of Munich since 2024, and is also a PI of the Munich Center for Machine Learning.
