He leads the Machine Learning and Simulation Lab, with affiliations to the Cluster of Excellence for the Simulation Sciences (SimTech), the Department of Computer Science, and the European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS). In addition to his academic roles, he serves as Chief Scientific Advisor at NEC Laboratories Europe, where he previously held positions as Chief Research Scientist and Manager of the Machine Learning Group. Before joining NEC Labs, Mathias was a postdoctoral researcher at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science at the University of Washington, Seattle. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science and Scientific Computing from Indiana University, USA. His research focuses on efficient and controllable generative AI, geometric and physics-aware deep learning, probabilistic graphical models, and the intersection of machine learning, the natural sciences, and engineering. His group develops methods for learning and leveraging physical and geometric structure, with applications spanning computational chemistry, fluid dynamics, and biomedical research. His work is regularly published in top-tier conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI, and UAI, and has received several best paper awards. Mathias is also a recipient of the Google Faculty Research Award and serves as Area Chair for leading conferences, including NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR.
