Before joining KAIST, I was a postdoctoral research fellow in Computer Science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I obtained my Ph.D degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), and B.S. in Computer Science from Sogang University. Research Interest AI for Scientific Discovery Materials (e.g., Spectroscopy, Property Prediction), Chemistry (e.g., Retrosynthesis, Drug Discovery, Relational Learning) Biology (e.g., Single-cell Foundation Model, Virtual Cell, Sequence Editing, Perturbation) Engineering, Electronic Design Automation (EDA), Circuit Analysis Agentic AI Various applications including drug discovery, molecular structure elucidation from spectroscopic data, etc (Multimodal) Large Language Models / Multimodal Data Mining Recommender System, Graph Neural Networks, Anomaly Detection, Time Series Analysis LLM Safety, Scene Graph Generation, Video Language Model Data-Centric AI Model Robustness, Adversarial Attack/Defense Imbalanced Learning, Few-show Learning, Explainable AI Announcements I am actively seeking for passionate and self-motivated Ph.D. students, MS students, and postdocs. If you are interested, send me an email with your interests, CV, and transcript. I am also looking for undergraduate students who are interested in doing internship in our lab, which will be open every summer and winter. If you are interested, send me an email with your interests, CV, and transcript. Interns will get opportunities to study about research topics that our lab is focusing on, and participate in research projects with graduate students. If you are interested in joining our lab as a graduate student, I strongly recommend you to do an internship before you apply. There are three ways to join our lab. You can apply through 1) Department of Industrial Engineering and Systems or 2) Graduate School of Data Science or 3) Graduate School of AI.
