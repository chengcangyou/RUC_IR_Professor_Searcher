This subsumes the specification of dynamic and flexible systems, learning models and adaptation policies, analyze and formally verify such models, and model synthesis. The considered systems are typically distributed systems, embedded real-time systems as well as systems that are capable to adapt and coordinate themselves (self-managed). Therefore, the chair further does research on model queries, model transformations, model and code generation, and model integration during development-time and run-time.
