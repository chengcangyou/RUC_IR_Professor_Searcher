Previous Next Ubiquitous Virtual Reality Lab Computing technology is radically changing the manner in which we communicate with media, spaces, people as well as computers. The Ubiquitous VR research aims at the development of new computing paradigms for Holistic DigiLog Life in Smart Space. It is highly interdisciplinary and thus covers diverse research areas, ranging from theoretical to practical and mathematical to intuitive. FocusAreas Specifically, three main research foci are planned: 3D Visual Computing, DigiLog UI/UX, Context-Aware Mobile Augmented Reality (CAMAR), etc. Note however that the realms of research are not restricted to these areas. We wish to broaden and deepen the understanding of various principal themes in the challenging new field such as Culture Technology.
