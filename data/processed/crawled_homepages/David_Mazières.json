If someone contacts you from that handle, they are either trying to defraud you or hurt SDF. I only ever send email from addresses that end .scs.stanford.edu or (in my capacity as an employee of Stellar Development Foundation) @stellar.org. If someone claiming to be me contacts you through some other channel, or through a fake email address (e.g., prof.davidmazieres@gmail.com and hello@davidmazieres.com were previously used to impersonate me), please notify me by email. Also, I rarely use linkedin, so fake profiles of me have more contacts than my real account. \"Professor\" David Mazières Bio, Vita Classes Papers Blog Misc Email Contact Photo credit: Lori Bode, Squink Industries Secure Computer Systems group",
