Iâve spent many years developing and building real-time robotic systems, creating autonomous agents and leading Machine Learning research. My work focuses developing Machine Learning research that leverages concepts and ideas from fields like Robotics and Computer Vision to create autonomous agents that have a better understanding of the world. I am interested in making autonomous agents not only understand the world around them, but to act upon this knowledge. Me and my research have featured in the media, including national newspaper articles, radio shows, web interviews and the University of Surrey News (SMILE, AVP).
