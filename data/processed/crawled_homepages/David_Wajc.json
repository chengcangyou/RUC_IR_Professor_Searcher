Until recently, I was a visiting scientist at Google. Earlier, I was a Motwani postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University. Earlier still, I got my PhD at Carnegie Mellon University’s Theory Group and my MSc and BSc at the Technion.My research mainly focuses on algorithms for (massive) evolving data, where we must react to changes in the data over time, while being constrained by: Time, i.e., dynamic algorithms.Space, i.e., streaming algorithms.Urgency, i.e., online algorithms.See my publications and my thesis to learn more.Current students:Yael Shabtay, MSc Prospective students: If you are are a student interested in algorithms research, feel free to reach out!CV          Contact: david.wajc@gmail.com          Office: Taub 518Google SitesReport abusePage detailsPage updated Google SitesReport abuse",
