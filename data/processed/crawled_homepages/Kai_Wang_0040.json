Please check here for more details. I am an Assistant Professor at Georgia Tech, School of Computational Science and Engineering. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Harvard University under supervision of Professor Milind Tambe. Research Interests Optimization, machine learning, reinforcement learning, online learning, algorithmic game theory, multi-agent systems. Please see the following pages for more information. Theory in ML and optimization Reinforcement learning Social Impact Applications We work closely with NGOs and hospitals to design and deploy AI solutions in social impact applications. Our goal is to ensure the AI algorithms actually work in practice to create real-world impact. Learn more Follow my journey",
