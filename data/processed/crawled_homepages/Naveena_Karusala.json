My research is on human-centered AI and health/wellbeing in underserved communities. I examine how we can design for more just care infrastructures that better recognize the labor, autonomy, and rights of care workers and care recipients. I use qualitative methods and participatory design to inform system-building, and draw on critical theory to interrogate systems of domination such as class, caste, gender, and race, and foreground the knowledge of marginalized communities. âI was previously a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard Center for Research on Computation and Society. I have a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Washington and an undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Georgia Tech. ââI also think a lot about care and work outside of research. I serve as Vice President for Communications on the SIGCHI Executive Committee, where I work to support an informed and connected HCI research community. I'm also active in community organizing and am always happy to chat more about this.",
