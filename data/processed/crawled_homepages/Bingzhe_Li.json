One lies in computer systems, including memory/storage systems, system for emerging applications (e.g., Blockchain and machine learning), and storage system security. The other focuses on low-cost hardware design in edge computing and IoT. Specifically, the current research interests include: • Intelligent and Emerging Storage Systems (e.g., DNA storage, ML for systems, etc.) • Systems for Big Data Applications (e.g., Blockchain, Machine Learning, etc.) • Energy-efficient and Low-power Computing Architecture We are looking for self-motivated students who are interested in pursuing Ph.D. degrees on the topic of developing storage and computer systems or designing energy efficient computing architecture for intelligent systems.
