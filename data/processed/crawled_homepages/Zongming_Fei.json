Research Research Interests: Network Protocols, Distributed Systems, and Cyber-Physical Systems. Recent Focus: Cloud Computing, Software Defined Networking, Overlay Networks, and Smart Grid Communications. Recent Research Projects FABRIC . FABRIC is an everywhere programmable nationwide instrument comprised of novel extensible network elements equipped with large amounts of compute and storage, interconnected by high speed, dedicated optical links. It will connect a number of specialized testbeds (5G/IoT PAWR, NSF Clouds) and high-performance computing facilities to create a rich fabric for a wide variety of experimental activities. VIPLanes. This project developed a Software Defined Networking(SDN) campus network architecture, called VIPLanes, that provides the ability for pre-authorized, trusted users to create flows that bypass middleboxes, thereby enabling those users to achieve substantially better performance while maintaining security and policy compliance for other network traffc. ENTeR . Enabling NeTwork Research and the Evolution of a Next Generation Midscale Research Infrastructure. Adopt-A-GENI. This project will make it easy to incorporate SDN network resources into GENI by developing automated services that make it easy for experimenters to route and send their traffic across SDN switches in their slice. Experimenters using standard routing paths should be able to do this without any knowledge of OpenFlow rules. GENI Desktop . This project will develop a unified framework and interface for accessing, controlling, and interacting with GENI experiments throughout experiment lifecylces. It will enhance the current GEMINI Desktop to be more tightly integrated with Flack, the GENI Portal, and OMNI tools.

Software Developed GENI Desktop (Collaborated with Dr. James Griffioen, Hussamuddin Nasir, and other members of the GENI Desktop team) GENI Desktop provides a unified framework and interface for interacting with GENI experiments. It support users throughout the various phases of an experiment's workflow, including experiment design, setup and deployment, monitoring and control, runtime interaction, and data collecting, archiving and analysis. It has been widely used by the GENI community for managing their experiments. A GENI Desktop tutorial can be found here . Another tutorial on GENI Desktop was developed by colleagues at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hills. An Overlay Multicast Approach for Multimedia Streaming (Collaborated with my students: Mengkun Yang, Sathish Ramani, and Sandeep Kumar Seethaapathy) This software tool aims at using overlay multicast to deliver multimedia contents to a group of users over the Internet. One key problem in overlay multicast is that a non-leaf node may leave the overlay multicast tree voluntarily and can cause the disruption of service to downstream nodes. This software implemented a proactive approach to tree recovery for dealing with the problem.
