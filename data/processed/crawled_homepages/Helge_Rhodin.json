Visit Visual AI for Extended Reality lab for current updates. I am a Professor at Bielefeld University and affiliate at UBC, working towards non-intrusive computer-human interaction by advancing 3D computer vision, machine learning, computer graphics, and augmented reality. The latest VR and AR devices offer incredible display capabilities; my contributions complement them by enabling high-quality dynamic reconstructions of our everyday environment from plain video input. Before I was an Assistant Professor at UBC, a postdoctoral researcher at EPFL, and PhD candidate in the GVV group of Christian Theobalt at the Max-Plack-Institute for Informatics (see Linkedin timeline).
