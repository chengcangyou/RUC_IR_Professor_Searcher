Cheriton Faculty Fellow at University of Waterloo's Cheriton School of Computer Science. I am a member of the Data Systems Research Group. Research Interests I do research on the architectures of data management and processing systems. My work focuses on developing systems for managing, querying, or doing analytics on graph-structured data. My main on-going systems project is Kuzu, which is an embeddable graph database management system (GDBMS) that is designed for high scalability and very fast querying. See this blog post that describes the vision of the system and these talks (1 and 2). For prospective postdoc, PhD, and MMath students: If you are interested in doing a postdoc or graduate studies developing large-scale data management, integration, and processing systems, reach out to me indicating your interests.
