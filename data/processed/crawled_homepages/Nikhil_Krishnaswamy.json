Broadly, I use simulation and multimodal methods to research human language understanding, communication, and cognition in a computational context, and have applied these methods to questions in HCI/HRI, linguistics, spatial reasoning, and data exploration, among others. Current Funded Projects Selected Past Funded Projects I got my Ph.D. from Brandeis University in 2017, followed by a three-year postdoc leading lab research on the DARPA-funded Communicating With Computers program. I also have an M.A. in Computational Linguistics from Brandeis (2013) and a B.S. in Computer Games Development from DePaul University (2010). I've worked in various aspects of AI, linguistics, defense, gaming, and education for a number of years. As an academic, my research focuses on human-AI collaboration and how humans and AI syste can use their complementary strengths to address novel, challenging problems. I study language by building computational systems that use language and studying how people interact with them, and by studying the ways that computational conceptual representations align (or fail to align) with human conceptual representations. I've lived in Maryland, New Mexico, Chicago, Ohio, and most recently, Boston, MA, where I began my academic career. I currently live in Fort Collins, CO, with my wife, Heather, and our kids, Ananya and Rohan. When not practicing computational shamanism, I run long distances, play heavy metal guitar, and enjoy pretending to be an author and a chef. Here are my two cats.
