This research includes characterizing the shifting long-term privacy needs of Internet users, better understanding the extent to which deep learning threatens user security and privacy on the web, as well as the practical impact of security-centric tools like Single Sign-On and VPNs for users and non-users alike. I am very interested in new collaborations, motivated students, and lively conversation regarding security research - please reach out via email or twitter if youâd like to chat!
