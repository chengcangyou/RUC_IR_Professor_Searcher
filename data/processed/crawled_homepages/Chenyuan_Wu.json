Prior to that, I received my Ph.D. in computer science from University of Pennsylvania in December 2024, advised by Prof. Boon Thau Loo. I also work closely with Prof. Dahlia Malkhi (Chainlink Labs & UCSB), Prof. Ryan Marcus (UPenn) and Prof. Mohammad Javad Amiri (Stony Brook University). My research interest mainly lies in blockchains and AI-driven systems. I am especially interested in using machine learning to build the next generation of decentralized systems that are adaptive and smart. In pursuit of this goal, I have researched and published across the system stack, from adaptive transaction management to adaptive Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus and their underlying infrastructure.🔥 I am looking for strongly motivated PhD students, research assistants, and summer interns.
