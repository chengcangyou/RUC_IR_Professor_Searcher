Phong Nguyen I am an Inria research professor (Directeur de recherche) in DI ENS (Computer Science Department of ENS PSL, Paris, France), specialized in cryptography. I am the head of the ENS Crypto Team, also known as Inria Equipe Projet Cascade. I am also a part-time professor (professeur attachÃ©) at ENS PSL. I am the principal investigator of the ERC Advanced Grant PARQ: Lattices in a Parallel and Quantum World. My research sits at the intersection of cryptography, number theory and algorithms. I am a French citizen born in 1975 in Paris. I obtained my PhD in 1999 and my HDR in 2007. I graduated from ENS-Lyon and I passed the agrÃ©gation de mathÃ©matiques in 1997.
