Education: - PhD in computer engineering at Dipartimento di Ingegneria Gestionale \"Antonio Ruberti\", Sapienza University of Rome, 1998 - M. Sc. in computer engineering at Dipartimento di Ingegneria Gestionale \"Antonio Ruberti\", Sapienza University of Rome, 1995 Vitae: A longer version of my curriculum can be found at this link Interessi di ricerca I have a background interest in the design and analysis of algorithms for NP-hard and on-line optimization problems, with emphasis on network efficient design and resource allocation. More recently, I studied problems arising in the modelling and analysis of algorithms and techniques for the mining and analysis of large scale information networks, such as Internet and the Web. Current research directions include  the application of spectral graph theory techniques to fully distributed graph clustering and the algorithmic modelling and analysis of large complex systems. A new further research direction is the application of advanced graph mining and spectral analysis techniques in the emerging area of Network Medicine.
