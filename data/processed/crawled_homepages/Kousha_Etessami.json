Publications: publications available online. Research interests: In general, theoretical computer science. More specifically: automated verification, logic, algorithms and computational complexity theory, algorithmic game theory, equilibrium computation, analysis of probabilistic systems, Markov decision processes, stochastic games, automata theory, model checking, analysis of infinite-state systems, finite model theory and descriptive complexity. Teaching: Algorithmic game theory course. Randomized Algorithms course. Discrete Mathematics course . (Stochastic) Modelling and Simulation course (Fall '05-'10). Compiling techniques course (Spring '03-'05). Some invited talks/tutorial slides Postdoctoral research associate: Václav Brožek (Newton Fellow, now at Google-Munich) Ph.D. students: Thomas Webster (completed Ph.D. in 2024). Emanuel Martinov (completed Ph.D. in 2021). Alistair Stewart (completed Ph.D. in 2014, now at Web3 Foundation.) Dominik Wojtczak (completed Ph.D. in 2009, now Lecturer at U. of Liverpool) I'm looking for Ph.D. students with a strong mathematics/theory background. If you are interested in applying for Ph.D. study with me, please contact me by email, and please apply via the School of Informatics postgraduate application web page. You are encouraged to also consider applying for a Ph.D. studentship within the Doctoral Training programme in Data Science or the Doctoral Training Programme in Pervasive Parallelism, both of which I have an affiliation with as a possible PhD supervisor. Software: PReMo: an analyzer for probabilistic recursive models (developed by D. Wojtczak).
