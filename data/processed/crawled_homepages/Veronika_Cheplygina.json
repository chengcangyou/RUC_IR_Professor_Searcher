I am a full professor at IT University of Copenhagen, where I am leading PURRlab (Pattern Recognition Revisited) research group, focusing on meta-research in the fields of machine learning and medical image analysis. I received my Ph.D. from Delft University of Technology in 2015, was a postdoc at Erasmus Medical Center, and an assistant professor at Eindhoven University of Technology. After failing to achieve various metrics, I left the tenure track of search of the next step where I could contribute to open and inclusive science. In 2021 I started as an associate professor at IT University of Copenhagen, and in 2025 was appointed as full professor at the same university. Next to research and teaching, I blog about academic life on this website. I also love cats, which you will often encounter in my talks and papers.
