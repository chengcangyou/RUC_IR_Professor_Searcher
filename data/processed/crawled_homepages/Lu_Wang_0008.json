Previously until 2020, she was at Khoury College of Computer Sciences, Northeastern University. She completed her Ph.D. in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University, under supervision of Professor Claire Cardie. Lu's research is focused on natural language processing, computational social science, and machine learning. More specifically, Lu aims to build trustworthy language models that produce factual, accurate, and safe content. She has worked on problems of summarization, generation, reasoning, argument mining, as well as creating novel applications to understand narratives and media bias and to support education. Her work won area chair award at ACL 2024, best paper honorable mention award at CHI 2023, outstanding paper award at ACL 2017, and best paper nomination award at SIGDIAL 2012. Lu's work has been mainly funded by National Science Foundation (NSF, including a CAREER award), Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), and industry partnerships. Lu currently serves as ACL equity director. She is a co-founder and an officer of ACL Special Interest Group on Summarization (SIGSUMM). Lu has also advised external corporations and organizations on NLP and AI applications (contact form). Announcements Fall 2024 I'm serving as program co-chair for Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL) 2025. Fall 2024 We're recruiting a postdoc researcher who is interested in narrative understanding, reasoning, or AI alignment. If you're interested, please email me with a 1-page statement of interest, your CV, two representative publications, and two contacts (one is PhD advisor) who can provide references. ‌ Current We are recruiting!
