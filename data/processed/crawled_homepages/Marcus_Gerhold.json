My expertise lies in the application and theory of model-based testing for software reliability in critical infrastructures, while my research spans a range of topics, including language version identification and game design. Teaching is a significant part of my work, and I enjoy delivering courses on programming and artificial intelligence to a diverse group of students. I also enjoy mentoring the many talented PhD, MSc, and BSc students, by guiding them through challenging projects and by coaching them as academic scholars and professionals.
