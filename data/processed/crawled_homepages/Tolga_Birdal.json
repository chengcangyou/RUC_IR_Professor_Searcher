To do so, I leverage tools from differential geometry and algebraic topology, in conjunction with deep neural networks. My research focuses on: 3D Computer Vision 3D/4D Generative Priors Geometric/Topological Deep Learning Statistical and Topological Learning Theory Quantum Computer Vision As a science advocate, I am committed to breaking down barriers to education, making knowledge accessible to all—especially those from underrepresented and underprivileged communities. Through initiatives like Bilimler Koyu, Nesin Maths Village, Arkhé and Poedat, I actively contribute to this mission. I envision the possibility of an alternative, transformative academia. #baskabirakademimumkun As an entrepreneur, I have co-founded multiple startups, including BeFunky, an online photo editing platform that empowers creativity worldwide. As a music aficionado, I am immersed into drums & percussion. I particularly appreciate blues, jazz, funk as well as folk, ethnic and experimental forms of rhythm and music holistically. I occasionally take stage with Zeyn’el Günbek, a Turkish indie folk musician. Fun facts: Felix Klein is my great^6th grandfather. I have an Erdős number of 3 (Guibas -> Pach -> Erdős).
