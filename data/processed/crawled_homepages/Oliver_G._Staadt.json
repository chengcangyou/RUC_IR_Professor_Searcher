ETH Oliver StaadtChair in Visual ComputingInsitute for Visual and Analytic ComputingFaculty of Computer Science and Electrical EngineeringUniversity of RostockAboutDr. Staadt is a full professor of Computer Science, Director of the Institute of Visual and Analytic Computing, and was, from 2016–2018, Dean of the Faculty of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at the University of Rostock. He received a Master of Science in computer science and a PhD in computer science from TU Darmstadt and ETH Zurich, respectively. Prior to joining the University of Rostock, he was an Assistant Professor of computer science at the University of California, Davis, where he was also the director of the Virtual Reality Laboratory. His research interests include computer graphics, virtual reality, telepresence, visualization, and multiresolution analysis. He serves as a member of international program committees of many graphics, VR, and visualization conferences. Dr. Staadt served as associate editor of the IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG), Computers & Graphics, and Computer Animation and Virtual Worlds, and is currently associate editor of Frontiers in Virtual Reality. He was co-chair of the program committees of the EG/IEEE Symposium on Point-Based Graphics (PBG) 2008, and the Forth International Symposium on 3D Data Processing, Visualization and Transmission (3DPVT) 2008, and the 5th Joint Virtual Reality Conference of Eurographics Virtual Environments and EuroVR (JVRC) 2013. He was STAR Co-Chair of Eurographics 2015 in Zurich and Program Co-Chair of ACM VRST 2017 in Gothenburg, Sweden. Dr. Staadt is fellow of the Eurographics Association and a member of ACM, ACM SIGGRAPH, and the IEEE Computer Society. From 2013-2020, he was chair of the Expert Group on Virtual and Augmented Reality of the German Informatics Society.InterestsVirtual and Augmented RealityComputer GraphicsComputer VisionMicrogravity ExperimentsImmersive AnalyticsTelepresenceEducationPhD in Computer Science, 2001ETH ZÃ¼richMSc in Computer Science, 1994Technical University of DarmstadtExperience     Full ProfessorUniversity of Rostock2007 â Present     DirectorInstitute of Visual and Analytic Computing, University of Rostock2023 â Present     DeanFaculty of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Rostock2016 â 2018     Vice DeanFaculty of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Rostock2010 â 2016     Assistant ProfessorComputer Science Department | University of California, Davis2002 â 2007     PostDocComputer Graphics Lab | ETH ZÃ¼rich2001 â 2002     Research AssistantComputer Graphics Lab | ETH ZÃ¼rich1994 â 2000Projects*Oct 2018EVOCATIONAdvanced Visual and Geometric Computing for 3D Capture, Display, and FabricationJan 2017SMOOTHSpatial and Temporal Filtering of Depth Data for TelepresenceAug 2016ARGuideInfluence of Gravity on Exocentric and Egocentric Target Cueing Using Augmented RealityJul 20133DPick3D Interaction in Microgravity EnvironmentsMay 2013DIVAData Intensive Visualization and AnalysisJun 2012TelepresenceThe Extended Window MetaphorOct 2008MuSAMAMuSAMA: High-Resolution Displays in Smart Appliance EnsemblesRecent PublicationsAn Integrative View of Foveated RenderingFoveated rendering adapts the image synthesis process to the userâs gaze.
