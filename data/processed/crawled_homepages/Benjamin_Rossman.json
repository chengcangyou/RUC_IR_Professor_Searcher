Previously, I held a faculty position at the University of Toronto and postdocs at the Tokyo Institute of Technology and National Institute of Informatics in Japan. I completed my PhD at MIT under the supervision of Madhu Sudan. My research seeks to understand how the structural properties of combinatorial problems influence their computational and descriptive complexity. My most significant results establish unconditional lower bounds in various circuit models for subgraph isomorphism problems, such as clique and connectivity in random graphs. I have openings for PhD students in the upcoming academic year. Feel free to contact me if interested.
