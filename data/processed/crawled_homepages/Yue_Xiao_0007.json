Prior to this, I was a Research Scientist at IBM Research. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Indiana University Bloomington, where I was advised by Prof. Luyi Xing and Prof.Xiaojing Liao. My research interests focus on the application of LLMs in security, privacy compliance analysis, vulnerability assessment, and software supply chain security. More broadly, I am interested in utilizing LLMs to tackle security challenges in downstream tasks (e.g., vulnerability management, CTF competitions), conduct system analysis to identify design flaws and detect real-world privacy violations in mobile supply chains by leveraging both program analysis and machine learning techniques.I am currently recruiting self-motivated Ph.D. students and research interns to join my lab.
