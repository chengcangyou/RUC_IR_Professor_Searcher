Prior to that I was a postdoctoral fellow at the School of Computer Science of the Carnegie Mellon University hosted by Professor Elaine Shi, a faculty fellow at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences of the New York University, mentored by Professor Yevgeniy Dodis, and a Research Associate at the School of Informatics of the University of Edinburgh and member of the Security and Privacy Group, the Blockchain Technology Laboratory and the Quantum Informatics Group. I hold a PhD degree in Cryptography from the University of Edinburgh advised by Professor Aggelos Kiayias and prior to that I studied Mathematics and Computer Science at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. Research Interests My research interests lie in the fields of Cryptography and Information Security, both theoretical and applied. Selected topics include: Key exchange protocols Înd-to-end encrypted protocols Blockchain technologies Non-malleable cryptography Hardware security Program Committees CCS 2023, 2024, 2025 ITC 2024 CANS 2024 ACNS 2023 CRYPTO 2022 ASIACRYPT 2022 ACNS 2022 External Reviewer CRYPTO: 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, 2021, 2023 EUROCRYPT: 2017, 2019, 2024, 2025 ACM CCS: 2017 ASIACRYPT: 2015, 2016 TCC: 2018, 2020 PKC: 2014 ACNS: 2015, 2018 FC: 2014, 2016, 2019 Selected Publications Fork-Resilient Continuous Group Key Agreement JoÃ«l Alwen, Marta Mularczyk, Yiannis Tselekounis (IACR CRYPTO 2023) Optimal Single-Server Private Information Retrieval Mingxun Zhou, Wei-Kai Lin, Yiannis Tselekounis, and Elaine Shi (random author ordering) (IACR EUROCRYPT 2023) Leakage Resilient l-more Extractable Hash and Applications to Non-Malleable Cryptography A.
