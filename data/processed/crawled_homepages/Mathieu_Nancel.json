My ongoing research focuses on the temporality of Human-Computer interactions, from the user's physiological and cognitive capabilities to the way interactive systems are designed and builtâand how to make them better. That involves: describing and modeling psycho-motor phenomena, sometimes challenging assumptions about the users' capabilities and best interests as with Interaction Interferences, clutching, or our Zero-Delay Marking Menu studies, designing interaction mechanisms that apply these findings to improve usability and user performance, e.g. preventing visual jitter that occurs even though every aspect of a system works as it should, or compensating end-to-end latency, engineering interactive systems that allow or facilitate the application of these mechanisms, for instance implementing our conceptual model of interaction history as a full-fledged software library [ongoing] to build safer and more flexible editing applications. I was the principal investigator of the Causality project funded by the French National Agency of Research (ANR), in which I applied these principles to cursor control and histories of command. I co-advised the PhD theses of Philippe Schmid and Alice Loizeau on these topics with StÃ©phane Huot. My background is in software engineering, and my research toolbox borrows from experimental psychology, interactive systems engineering, and interaction design. During my PhD and subsequent postdocs I have worked extensively on interacting at a distance with large displays, focusing on designing and evaluating interaction techniques for cursor control (e.g. [C3, J2, C6, C12]), command selection [C4, C8], and virtual navigation [C1], with an interest in exploring and leveraging new* sensing technology like motion tracking (VICON [J2], Kinect [C4], LEAP [C8], ...) and electromyographic sensors [C6]. These projects progressively guided me towards more fundamental aspects of interactive systems design and implementation, exploring and answering lingering questions that no longer concern only a specific platform but all aspects of our experience of interactive systems. Meanwhile, I recently contributed to the design of the first standard for the French keyboard layout (see [J3, R4, R5] and norme-azerty.fr for more information on the process), and I co-authored two high school textbooks on a new nationwide course of introductory programming [B1, B2].

Their cause lays in the design of most GUIs, for which any user event on an interactive element unquestionably reflects the user's intention-even one millisecond after that element has changed. Previous work indicate that interferences can cause frustration and sometimes severe consequences. This paper investigates new default behaviors for GUI elements that aim to prevent the occurrences of interferences or to mitigate their consequences. We present a design space of the advantages and technical requirements of these behaviors, and demonstrate in a controlled study how simple rules can reduce the occurrences of so-called 'Pop-up-style' interferences, and user frustration. We then discuss their application to various forms of interaction interferences. We conclude by addressing the feasibility and trade-offs of implementing these behaviors in existing systems. â² Hide the abstract [B2] NumÃ©rique et Sciences Informatiques Tle SpÃ©cialitÃ©.

We also demonstrate the applicability of ''hardware-independent'' transfer functions defined in physical units. We explore two methods to maintain hardware-independent pointer performance in operating systems that require hardware-dependent definitions: scaling them to the resolutions of the input and output devices, or selecting the OS acceleration setting that produces the closest visual behavior. In a second controlled experiment, we adapted a baseline function to different screen and mouse resolutions using both methods, and the resulting functions provided equivalent performance. Lastly, we provide a tool to calculate equivalent transfer functions between hardware setups, allowing users to match pointer behavior with different devices, and researchers to tune and replicate experiment conditions. Our work emphasizes, and hopefully facilitates, the idea that operating systems should have the capability to formulate pointing transfer functions in physical units, and to adjust them automatically to hardware setups. â² Hide the abstract [J3] AZERTY amÃ©liorÃ©: Computational Design on a National Scale.

We describe a human-centric approach developed jointly with stakeholders to utilize computational methods in the decision process not only to solve a well-defined problem but also to understand the design requirements, to inform subjective views, or to communicate the outcomes. To be more broadly useful, research must develop computational methods that can be used in a participatory and inclusive fashion respecting the different needs and roles of stakeholders. â² Hide the abstract [B1] NumÃ©rique et Sciences Informatiques 1re SpÃ©cialitÃ©.
