Her research focuses on mathematical modeling and algorithm design for large-scale optimization problems arising in communication networks, transportation and logistics networks and artificial intelligence. Recent studies include the design of efficient algorithms for network design, dimensioning and provisioning, scheduling algorithms in optical grids or clouds, in broadband wireless networks and in passive optical networks. In Artificial Intelligence, contributions include the development of efficient optimization algorithms for probabilistic logic (reasoning under uncertainty) and for automated mechanical design in social networks (design of trust estimator tools). In transportation, her recent contributions include new algorithms for freight train scheduling and locomotive assignment subject to energy minimization, as well as machine learning frameworks for efficient cross-docking. B. Jaumard has published over 300 papers in international journals in Operations Research and in Telecommunications.
