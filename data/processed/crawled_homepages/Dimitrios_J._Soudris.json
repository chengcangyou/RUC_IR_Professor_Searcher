Therefore it is necessary to find proper ways for mitigating the increasing energy cost of HVAC systems (Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning). The problem of increased energy requirements becomes far more crucial by taking into consideration the sub-optimal operation of HVAC systems by the occupants. In order to alleviate these drawbacks, throughout this chapter we introduce a decision-making mechanism in order to support the temperature control within buildings. For this purpose, a smart thermostat concept is applied, where emphasis is given to lowering the cost and deployment flexibility, in order to be widely adopted in different buildings and regions. The proposed mechanism incorporates supervised learning and reinforcement learning techniques in order to solve a multi-objective problem that comprises both satisfying occupant's thermal comfort and minimize energy consumption.\", isbn=\"978-3-030-03640-9\", doi=\"10.1007/978-3-030-03640-9_10\", url=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-03640-9_10\" } Copy text Dimitris Rodopoulos , Nikolaos Zompakis , Michail Noltsis , Francky Catthoor and Dimitrios Soudris “HARPA RT,” book chapter in “Harnessing Performance Variability in Embedded and High-performance Many/Multi-core Platforms – A Cross-layer Approach” Springer Publishers Christoforos Kachris , Elias Koromilas , G.
