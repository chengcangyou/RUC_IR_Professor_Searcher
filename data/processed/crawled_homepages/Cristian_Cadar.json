My research interests span the areas of software engineering, computer systems and software security, with a focus on building practical techniques for improving the reliability and security of software systems. I have received the Humboldt Research Award in 2024, IEEE New Directions Award (jointly with Prof Abhik Roychoudhury) in 2022, BCS Roger Needham Award in 2019, a SIGOPS Hall of Fame award in 2018, an ERC Consolidator Grant in 2018, the HVC Award in 2017, the ACM Computer and Communications Security (CCS) Test of Time Award in 2016, a BCS Fellowship in 2016, the Jochen Liedtke Young Researcher Award in 2015 and an EPSRC Early-Career Fellowship in 2013. Our research has received Distinguished Paper Award at ISSTA 2023, Best Artifact Award at FormaliSE 2023, Best Experience Paper Award at ASE 2017, Best Paper Award at ICST 2016, Best Artifact Award at ISSTA 2014, Distinguished Artifact Award at ESEC/FSE 2013, and the Jay Lepreau Best Paper Award at OSDI 2008. Previously, I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford University, an M.Eng. in Computer Science from MIT, and a B.S. in Computer Science and one in Mathematics also from MIT. I am always looking for bright and motivated PhD students interested in developing novel techniques and tools for improving software reliability, and we regularly have postoc openings too. I am particularly interested in students having a strong background in systems programming and compilers, and experience with building and working with large software systems. Please send me email if you are interested in doing a PhD in my group, and attach a CV to your email. If your background matches our research interests, I will try to send a reply soon. We advertise specific funding opportunities here. Selected Publications The full list of papers published since 2010 is available on the Software Reliability Group website.
