Mooij Home Group Publications Software Teaching Biography Contact Professor of Mathematical Statistics About me I am professor of mathematical statistics at the Korteweg-De Vries Institute of the University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The research focus of my group is on causality, and spans a broad spectrum from causal modeling, discovery, and inference to applications in biology, medicine, fairness and business analytics. We combine mathematical modeling, statistical and algorithmic aspects. Lecture notes The 2025 edition of our lecture notes A Mathematical Introduction to Causality are available! These lecture notes for the MasterMath course on Causality that I taught together with Patrick Forré are available for public dissemination. We might make a book of this at some point, so feedback is welcome! News Jul 2024: UAI 2024 took place in Barcelona, Spain. Many thanks to all organizers and participants for enabling a great event! Apr 2024: Mijn presentatie Causaliteit en statistiek voor Leve de Wiskunde. Feb 2024: The Dutch newspaper NRC published an interview (in Dutch, behind a paywall) with me about my research. Feb 2024: The third Amsterdam Causality Meeting will take place on February 29th. Nov 2023: The second Amsterdam Causality Meeting will take place on November 23rd. Sep 2023: We are organizing a new seminar, the Amsterdam Causality Meeting. First edition will take place on October 9th! Sep 2023: Sourbh Bhadane joined my group as postdoc. Aug 2023: Best paper award for our UAI paper Establishing Markov equivalence in cyclic directed graphs. Embarassingly, after publication we discovered a serious mistake, which we luckily managed to fix. Here is the corrected version. Jun 2023: I gave a plenary talk on Causality and fairness at AIM2023, the second workshop on AI and Mathematics. Jun 2023: My inaugural lecture was published in Nieuw Archief voor Wiskunde. May 2023: Thijs van Ommen and I organized the SIKS Course on Causal Inference 2023. Apr 2023: Stéphanie van der Pas, Richard Post and I organized the YES Causal Inference workshop. Mar 2023: This work by my former PhD student Tineke Blom, Causality and Independence in Perfectly Adapted Dynamical Systems, has drastically changed my view on causality in complex systems. Bottom line: these systems can show a causal semantics that is more complex than we are used to in DAGs. Older news...",
