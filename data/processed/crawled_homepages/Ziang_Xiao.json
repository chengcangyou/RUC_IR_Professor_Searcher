I am an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. I completed my Ph.D in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I was co-advised by Prof. Hari Sundaram and Prof. Karrie Karahalios. I earned my B.S. in Psychology and Statistics & Computer Science at the University of Illinois with Prof. Dov Cohen. My research is motivated by the fundamental question of understanding humans at scale. My goal is to study human-computer interaction to expand our knowledge about our behaviors and decision-making processes. Currently, I want to spend my time on three exciting topics, AI for Social Science, Human-centered Model Evaluation, and Information Seeking. Broadly, my work lies in the intersection of human-computer interaction, natural language processing, and social and personality psychology. Teaching.
