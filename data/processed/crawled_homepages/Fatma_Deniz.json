I am a Full Professor at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Vice President for Digitalization and Sustainability at the Technische Universitaet Berlin. My group is interested in understanding how complex information is encoded in the brain. To understand this we use machine-learning approaches to fit computational models to large-scale brain data acquired during natural tasks. Currently, we explore how more than one language can coexist in the human brain. Before joining the TU Berlin, I was a postdoctoral researcher and exceptional principal investigator at the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute in UC Berkeley, a Moore-and-Sloan Data Science Fellow at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science , and DAAD postdoctoral fellow at International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) in Berkeley. I did my Ph.D. in Computational Neuroscience at Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience in Berlin, obained a M.Sc. in Computer Science from the Technical University of Munich and worked at California Institute of Technology during my masterâs thesis. I routinely disregard disciplinary boundaries and follow my curiosity. This makes my work lie at the intersection between data science, neuroscience and artificial intelligence. I design and promote approaches for scientific reproducibility and co-edited a book on reproducibility published here. Here is an online version of the book. I also worked on improving online user authentication applications using image based authentication procedures combined with knowledge gained from cognitive neuroscience (Check MooneyAuth ) and created a database of two-tone Mooney images. E-mail me if you would like to use those for your research. Code is available on GitHub. I am a passionate coder, baker, and I love feeling the resonance when I play the cello which makes me simply happy.
