Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. I am a member of the EconCS research group and a faculty affiliate of the Center for Research on Computation and Society (CRCS). I’m excited about many topics at the intersection of computer science, especially artificial intelligence and theoretical computer science, and social sciences. My work usually brings the consideration of incentives, human behavior and social impacts to computational systems. My interests include information elicitation and aggregation, incentive-aware machine learning, information design, human-AI collaboration, behavior experiments, algorithmic fairness, algorithmic game theory and multi-agent systems.
