If you would like to join our lab, please contact with me via e-mail. Professor, University of Tsukuba, Department of Computer Science, Graduate School of Systems and Information Engineering Director of Center for Artificial Intelligence Research (C-AIR) Deputy Director of Center for Cyber Medicine Research Research Interests:  Pattern recognition, Computer vision, Machine learning Theory: Statics method, kernel machines, especially the methods based on the geometrical relation of multiple subspaces: Subspace Method, the Mutual Subspace Method, and those nonlinear extensions using Kernel trick, clustering and classification methods on Grassmann manifold, Theoretical integration of statistical method and geometric method in computer vision, in particular, seamless integration of appearance-based approach and feature points based approach in object recognition. Applications: 3D object, face recognition, using multiple images from video image, multiple camera system, human sensing such as gaze detection, gesture recognition, finger alphabets recognition, robot vision using multi-view images from active camera system, bio-imaging processing and sensor network system. International workshop Subspace: We have held the international workshops focused on subspace methods called Subspace. The goal of this workshop is to share the prominent potential of subspace methods with researchers working on various problems in computer vision, and encourage interactions leading to further developments of subspace methods. You can download the proceedings of Subspace 2007, 2009, 2010. A short survey on subspace methods can be found in this article in Computer vision: a reference guide, 2020. We have released the new tsukuba stereo database. The demo is available at the site.
