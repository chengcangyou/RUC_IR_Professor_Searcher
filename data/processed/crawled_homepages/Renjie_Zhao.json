I am looking for self-motivated students on research projects in wireless networking and mobile computing. Please check my past papers to get a general understanding of my research style and check Notes to the Prospective Students.My research interests are centered around wireless networking and mobile computing, with a particular focus on next-generation wireless network architectures (5G millimeter-wave, 6G joint communication and sensing, Internet of Things), novel radio hardware and software design (software-defined radio, wireless brain interfaces, low-power ultra-wide-band) and ubiquitous communication and sensing systems (smart homes, virtual/augmented reality, localization, ultra-reliable RFID for supply chains).I have published in several top conferences, including ACM SIGCOMM, MobiCom, and USNIEX NSDI. In recognition of my work on massive MIMO millimeter-wave software radio, I was awarded the Best Paper Award at ACM MobiCom 2020. My work on this project has also been highlighted by ACM GetMobile, the top pick of the ACM SIGMOBILE area.I received the M.S. degree (2020) and Ph.D. degree (2023) at Electrical and Computer Engineering Department in UC San Diego, advised by Professor Xinyu Zhang. I received my B.E. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2018, where I worked on Backscatter Communications with Professor Xiaohua Tian and Professor Xinbing Wang.News:08/2025.
