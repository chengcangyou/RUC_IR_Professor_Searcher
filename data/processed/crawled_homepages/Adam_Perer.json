Adam Perer · Carnegie Mellon I study how people engage and make decisions with data I design new interfaces and visualizations to interact with data I assist impactful domains drowning in data. Much of my work also deals with the ubiquity of AI, where I help interpret data masked by complex AI techniques and facilitate human-AI collaboration. I co-direct the Data Interaction Group, whose mission is to empower everyone to analyze and communicate data with interactive systems. Adam Perer is an Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University, where he is a member of the Human-Computer Interaction Institute and he is Co-Director of the Data Interaction Group. His research integrates data visualization and machine learning techniques to create visual interactive systems to help users make sense out of big data. Lately, his research focuses on human-centered data science and extracting insights from clinical data to support data-driven medicine. He has published over 50 peer-reviewed papers at premier venues in visualization, human-computer interaction, and medical informatics. He is currently an Area Papers Chair at IEEE VIS and a Visualization Subcommittee Papers Chair at ACM CHI. He was previously a Research Scientist at IBM Research. He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Maryland, College Park.
