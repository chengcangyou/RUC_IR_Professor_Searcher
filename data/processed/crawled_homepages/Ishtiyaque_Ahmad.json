My research interest lies in the intersection of distributed systems, data management, and applied cryptography. More specifically, my research goal is to break the prevailing tension between scalability and privacy in present days' technological solutions. I completed my PhD from the Department of Computer Science at University of California, Santa Barbara. I was co-supervised by Professors Divy Agrawal, Amr El Abbadi, and Trinabh Gupta. Before starting my PhD, I worked as a lecturer in the department of Computer Science and Engineering at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). Prior to that, I completed my BSc. and MSc. in Computer Science and Engineering at BUET under the supervision of Professor AKM Ashikur Rahman.
