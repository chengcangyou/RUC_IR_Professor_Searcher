My research focus is information security, cryptography and algorithms. I am particularly interested in what happens when cryptographic systems meet the real world, where computation is faulty and leaky. I head the Laboratory for Experimental Information Security (LEISec), where my group investigates side-channel information leakage in computers through physical emanations (e.g., acoustic, electric and electromagnetic) and software (e.g., cache contention in local and cloud computing), and networks (e.g., identifying encrypted videos). I cofounded SCIPR Lab, where we construct cryptographic zero-knowledge SNARK proof systems for ensuring the integrity of computation conducted on untrusted, faulty and malicious platforms; and the ZKProof.org standardization effort for such schemes. I'm interested in blockchain-based cryptographic protocols, and am a founding scientist of the Zcash privacy-preserving cryptocurrency which implements our Zerocash protocol, and a founder of Sealance Corp. which builds blockchain-based privacy-preserving financial regulation technology. Other research interests include machine learning security, tamper resilience, homomorphic encryption, special-purpose code-breaking hardware and various aspects of network and systems security. See my publications for more information. I formerly taught and pursued my research at Columbia University, Tel Aviv University, Microsoft Research and MIT, and received my Ph.D. at the Weizmann Institute of Science.",
