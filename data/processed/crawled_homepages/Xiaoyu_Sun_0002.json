My research focus is on mobile software engineering (i.e., mobile security and quality assurance) and Intelligent software engineering (SE4AI, AI4SE, LLM4SE). My interests include applying static code analysis, dynamic program testing, and machine learning techniques to strengthen the security and reliability of software systems. Research My work contributes to the fields of software engineering, programming languages, and cyber security. My research combines aspects of static/dynamic analysis techniques and software testing techniques to detect software defects, e.g., compatibility issues, privacy leaks, typestate misuse, etc. I have published several high-quality papers in software engineering journals (TOSEM) and conferences (ICSE, ASE, ISSRE). Multiple Ph.D. positions with full financial support will be available in my group.Â Please contact me if you are aÂ self-motivatedÂ PhD student (or graduate student interested in our PhD program) withÂ strong programming skillsÂ andÂ strong interestsÂ in software analysis, security and machine learning as well as deep learning. Biography I am now a lecturer of computer science at the Australian National University. I obtained my PhD degree from Monash University in 2023. Before pursuing my PhD, I was a senior software engineer at Alibaba Group where I developed and implemented scaled, distributed systems. bars search times",
