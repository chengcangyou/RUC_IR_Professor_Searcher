On the methodical side we perform research on the analysis of biological sequences (including recombination, viral evolution and computational epigenetics), analysis and prediction of protein structure and function, analysis of intermolecular interactions and interaction networks, gene and protein expression patterns, computational drug screening and drug design. On the application side, we focus on the diseases HIV/AIDS, where we analyse viral drug resistance patterns as well as variants of viral entry into the host cell, HCV/Hepatitis C, where we contribute to uncovering the molecular basis of host-pathogen interactions and neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases, where we study underlying protein interaction networks.Thomas Lengauer has retired in 2018. The group is now closed.
