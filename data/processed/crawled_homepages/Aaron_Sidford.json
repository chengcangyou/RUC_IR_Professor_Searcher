I received my PhD from the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where I was advised by Professor Jonathan Kelner.Research Interests:My research interests lie broadly in optimization theory, the theory of computation, and the design and analysis of algorithms. I am particularly interested in work at the intersection of continuous optimization, algorithmic graph theory, numerical linear algebra, and data structures. My work often focuses on the design of provably efficient algorithms for solving fundamental, large scale optimization problems.Email: [last name]@stanford.edu where [last name]=sidford Google SitesReport abusePage detailsPage updated Google SitesReport abuse",
