University of California, Berkeley B.Tech. Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi I am a Professor at Department of Computer Science and Engineering and at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. I am also affiliated with National Resource Centre for Value Education in Engineering. My current areas of interest include Neuroimaging, Yogic Neuroscience and Machine Learning. Prior to joining IIT-Delhi, I worked for Opera Solutions India as VP Analytics and Head R&D. Headquartered in New York City, Opera Solutions is an analytics software/solutions company providing state-of-the-art analytics solutions to several global Fortune 500 clients. Prior to Opera Solutions in August 2011, I worked at the Computational Biology Center of IBM T. J. Watson research center, Yorktown Heights, NY, USA. My research explored the use of High-performance computing and machine learning techniques for the analysis of Neuroimaging data.  I developed algorithms to solve inverse problems in the domain of medical image reconstruction and analyze functional connectivity of the brain in the domain of fMRI data analysis. Before moving to IBM TJ Watson Research Center, I was manager of the high-performance computing group at IBM India Research Lab. I was privileged to work with some wonderful colleagues at the IBM India Research Lab. All the wonderful work we did wouldnt have been possible without their enthusiasm, active involvement and support. My earlier areas of work include communication networks, game theory, auction algorithms and Economics. I also held an adjunct faculty position in the Computer Science Department of Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, where I taught courses on game theory and communications networks.

Most of my projects require problem solving and building systems/software/application/algorithms for solving the problem. The innovation comes from applying techniques learned in one domain to problems in another domain. These projects require varying degrees of expertise and skills that I have picked up over the years. Those interested in working on these projects, should best avoid expectation of working in any particular area. Instead it will be better if they find the problem interesting and worth solving. I try to guide the students towards their innate strengths areas and try to adapt the problems to suit their temperaments and interests. o   fMRI data analysis methods o   Yogic Neuroscience o   Computational Sanskrit linguistics o   Posture estimation and tracking Students interested in internships, please read this before you write an email to me. News: Students from CFTI (Centrally Funded Technical Institutions) with 8+ GPA can now get admission into the (two year) full-time Masters by Research (MSR) program in the CSE as well as in SIT without GATE.  For more information read the information brochure or write an email to me with subject Interested in full-time MSR/PhD. Students from CFTI in their third year who are interested in applying to IIT-Delhi for the MS-Research or PhD program, can apply for Internship with me at IIT-Delhi. Successful students will be given offer of admission to IIT Delhi at the end of their Internship. Please write to me with the following on the subject line CFTI Internship. Students interested in research should consider applying to the MSR or PhD program at IIT-Delhi. You may consider MSR/PhD at School of Information Technology for interdisciplinary applied areas, Computer Science and Engineering for fundamental CS research or a PhD at National Resource Center for Value Education in Engineering for research in Yogic Sciences. University of Queensland and IIT-Delhi now offer a very strong joint PhD program in brain sciences and neuroimaging. There are two options for the PhD program. Under the Indian option students are expected to spend 1 year at UQ, Australia, and rest of the time at IIT Delhi. Under the Australian option, the students are expected to spend one year at IIT-Delhi and rest of the time at UQ. Please also explore the IIT-Delhi and University of Queensland joint PhD program in the area of machine learning applied to fMRI analysis, epilepsy (project number UQIDAR 00166). Students who obtain very good UG grades may now be eligible to apply for PhD under prime minister research fellowship (PMRF). This program offers a stipend of Rs. 70,000-80,000 per month (depending on your stage in the PhD program) and research grant of Rs.2 lakhs per year.  A caution  the program may be very competitive and some of the decisions may seem rbitrary and unfair to applicants. So, for students seriously considering PhD, it is a good idea to have a backup option other than PMRF.
