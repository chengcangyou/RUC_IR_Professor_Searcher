Previously, he was a faculty at the Nova University of Lisbon, and prior to that at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS), where he led the Dependable Systems Group. He received his PhD degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2005, under the supervision of Prof. Barbara Liskov. He has won several fellowships and awards, including a best paper award at the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, the flagship conference in computer systems, a special recognition award from MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, an ERC starting grant, and a Google faculty research award. He published and served on the program committee of the leading venues in the systems area, including SOSP, OSDI, NSDI, ASPLOS, and as program co-chair of EuroSys. He has graduated a total of seven PhD students as main advisor, who have taken on tenure-track and tenured faculty positions in leading academic institutions such as Purdue, Univ. Edinburgh, TU Munich, or USTC in China. His service record includes serving as co-director of the Carnegie Mellon-Portugal program, the research axis of the Portuguese National Digital Skills Initiative e.2030, and, more recently, as President of the Scientific Council of Instituto Superior Técnico. Selected recent papers (since 2010) The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Research Council under the ERC Grant Agreement number 307732, Project DependableCloud.
