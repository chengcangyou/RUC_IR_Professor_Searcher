Staff details Position Reader in Data Science Department Computing Email l.soldatova (@gold.ac.uk) Larisa joined Goldsmiths in November 2017 as director of the online Masters in Data Science programme. Larisa is an internationally recognized expert in AI, particularly in discovery science, reasoning, knowledge representation and semantic technologies. She leads in Goldsmiths the EPSRC-funded project ACTION on cancer aiming to develop an AI system to assist in recommending personalized cancer treatments. The project is in partnership with the University of Manchester and has a funding total of over £1,300,000. Larisa is also working on the Robot Scientists project, which investigates what processes of scientific discovery can be automated and how robotic and human scientists can work together. The Robot Scientist Adam was the first system that made an autonomous scientific discovery. Larisa is involved in a number of international projects on the development of semantic standards, e.g. Machine Learning Schema, Robotics Task Ontology Standard, Laboratory Protocols EXACT.
