Desing and develop a query optimizer for relational data exploiting quantum technologies. TALE (co-PI) Property Graphs at Scale (H.F.R.I.) The main objective of this work is to design a technological stack, based on solid theoretical underpinning, around the property graph data model that can enable graph processing and analytics at scale. The aim has largely escaped the attention of the academic community despite its prominence in practical applications. In particular, such a stack shall ensure correctness of graph specifications, graph queries, and graph transformations. The overarching aims of this work is to capitalize expertise and technology that is developed for decades at FORTH for semantic graphs, such as those of graph databases, semantic web technologies, foundations of databases and data models, big data systems, as well as graph algorithms and techniques and to generate a whole new field of interest the scientific community focusing on Property Graphs.
