He has published over 300 papers in his field and is on the PCs of many major international conferences in middleware and distributed systems. He is also a member of the steering committee of the ACM/ IFIP/ Usenix Middleware series of conferences. His current research interests include distributed systems architecture, middleware (including reflective and adaptive middleware), model-driven engineering techniques applied to adaptive distributed systems, and the applicability of contemporary distributed systems technologies (including cloud computing and the Internet of Things) to environmental science. He is co-author of the highly successful book Distributed Systems: Concepts and Design by Coulouris, Dollimore, Kindberg and Blair with the 5th edition published in 2011. He also holds a prestigious EPSRC Senior Fellowship in Digital Technology and Living with Environmental Change (DT/LWEC), and is co-editor in chief of Springer's Journal of Internet Services and Applications. He is theme lead (environment theme) for Lancaster's Data Science Institute, and also co-founder of the Centre of Excellence in Environmental Data Science (CEEDS), a joint initiative between DSI and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH). Research Overview My core research focuses on the area of distributed systems and, more specifically, on the middleware architectures that underpin complex distributed systems applications and services. This includes examination of key distributed properties such as interoperability and how this can be achieved in the complex and dynamic distributed systems of today. I have a strong interest in more applied areas of computing including how innovations in computer science can support environmental science in responding to challenges around climate change; areas of innovation include ubiquitous computing (new forms of data), cloud computing (elastic capacity to stoare and process this data) and data science (techniques to make sense of this data).
