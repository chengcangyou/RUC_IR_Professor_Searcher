To this end, my work involves (1) improving machine learning methods for controllable generative modeling for music, audio, and other sequential data, and (2) deploying real-world interactive systems that allow a broader audience—inclusive of non-musicians—to harness generative music AI through intuitive controls.I am particularly drawn to research ideas with direct real-world applications, and my work often involves building systems for real users to be evaluated in-the-wild. For example, my work on Piano Genie was used in a live performance by The Flaming Lips, and my work on Dance Dance Convolution powers Beat Sage, a live service used by thousands of users a day to create multimodal music game content.Previously, I was a postdoc at Stanford CS advised by Percy Liang. Before that, I completed a PhD at UCSD co-advised by Miller Puckette and Julian McAuley.News🎤 (Dec 2025) Two invited talks at NeurIPS 2025 Workshops: GenProCC and AI4Music🧑‍🏫 (Nov 2025) Reappointed as Assistant Professor at CMU.🎤 (Oct 2025) Invited talk What music can teach language models, CMU LTI Colloquium (recording)📜 (Sep 2025) Two papers (Music Arena, Live Music Models) accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Creative AI Track, to be presented in the main conference.📜 (Sep 2025) Paper accepted to the LLM4Music workshop @ ISMIR 2025🌐 (Aug 2025) My Google research project SingSong featured in the Pixel Recorder app🌐 (Jul 2025) Music Arena released (paper)!📜 (Jul 2025) Paper accepted at WASPAA 2025 on sound morphing.📜 (Jul 2025) Two papers accepted to ISMIR 2025 on music evaluation and real-time adaptation (pre-print forthcoming).📜 (Jun 2025) Two papers accepted at ICML 2025 workshops (R2-FM, DataWorld, pre-prints forthcoming).🌐 (Jun 2025) Led the effort of a new open weights real-time music generation model along with my team at Google DeepMind: Magenta RealTime.📜 (May 2025) Our paper on Copilot Arena accepted to ICML 2025.🗞️ (May 2025) My PhD student Wayne Chi (co-advised w/ Ameet Talwalkar) quoted in WSJ article.🗞️ (Apr 2025) CMU SCS news article featuring Copilot Arena.🏅 (Apr 2025) Our paper on co-design for audio codec LMs received the Best Paper Award (top 1) at the NAACL Student Research Workshop 2025.🎓 (Apr 2025) My PhD student Wayne Chi (co-advised w/ Ameet Talwalkar) has received the NDSEG Fellowship.📜 (Mar 2025) Paper on Copilot Arena accepted to the HEAL@CHI workshop.🎶 (Mar 2025) Project proposal w/ Annie Hsieh (CMU CFA) funded by the AIxArts incubator fund at CMU.🛠️ (Mar 2025) Workshop proposal on ML for Audio accepted at ICML 2025.🏅 (Mar 2025) Our paper on AMUSE recognized with a Best Paper Award (top 1% of submissions) at CHI 2025.📜 (Mar 2025) Paper accepted at the NAACL Student Research Workshop 2025.🎶 (Mar 2025) Shoutout from Darkside for helping them train RAVE for their album Nothing.📜 (Feb 2025) Our work on VERSA accepted to NAACL Demo Track 2025.📜 (Feb 2025) New pre-print on Copilot Arena📜 (Jan 2025) Our work on AMUSE accepted to CHI 2025.🗞️ (Nov 2024) Blog post on Copilot Arena📜 (Nov 2024) One paper accepted at the NeurIPS 2024 Open World Agents Workshop.🎤 (Oct 2024) Invited talk at SANE 2024 (video, slides).🌐 (Oct 2024) Launch of Copilot Arena, a VSCode extension for evaluating LLMs for coding assistance.📜 (Oct 2024) Three extended abstracts to appear at ISMIR Late Breaking Demos.📜 (Oct 2024) One paper accepted at the NeurIPS 2024 Audio Imagination Workshop.🌐 (Aug 2024) Official launch of Hookpad Aria, a Copilot for songwriters.📜 (Jun 2024) Our work on Music-aware Virtual Assistants accepted at UIST 2024.📜 (Jun 2024) Two papers accepted to ISMIR 2024.🪑 (Apr 2024) Named as the Dannenberg Assistant Professor of Computer Science.🛎️ (Apr 2024) Serving as Senior Program Committee Co-chair for ISMIR 2024 - record number of submissions (415).🌐 (Mar 2024) A Copilot-like tool for musicians featuring the Anticipatory Music Transformer was launched in beta.📜 (Mar 2024) Music ControlNet to appear in TASLP (IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing).📜 (Mar 2024) Anticipatory Music Transformer to appear in TMLR (Transactions on Machine Learning Research).🌐 (Mar 2024) Launch of MusicFX DJ Mode, a real-time music audio generation tool developed by my team at Google.🗞️ (Nov 2023) SingSong incorporated into Google DeepMind’s Music AI Tools.📜 (Nov 2023) Work presented at HCMIR Workshop by Michael Feffer.📜 (Nov 2023) New preprint on controllable music gen led by Shih-Lun Wu (applying to PhD positions!)🗞️ (Oct 2023) Interviewed for Pitchfork article about MusicLM🎤 (Oct 2023) Invited talk at Stanford HAI Conference (recording, slides)🧑‍🏫 (Oct 2023) Guest lecture for CMU LLM Course (slides)👋 (Oct 2023) New PhD students: Irmak Bukey and Wayne Chi🧑‍🏫 (Sep 2023) Started as Assistant Professor at CMUG-CLefI lead the Generative Creativity Lab (G-CLef) at CMU.
