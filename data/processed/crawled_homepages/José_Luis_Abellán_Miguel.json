I lead the EcoArTech team.Short biographyJosé L. Abellán obtained his Bachelor’s, Master’s, and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Murcia (UMU), Spain, in 2007, 2008, and 2012, respectively. He currently holds a Ramón y Cajal position, a prestigious tenure-track Associate Professor role, in the Department of Computer Engineering at UMU. Before joining UMU in 2023, he served as a predoctoral researcher at the University of Ferrara, Italy, in the summer of 2011. From 2012 to 2014, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the ICSG research laboratory at Boston University, Massachusetts, USA, and from 2014 to 2022, he held an Associate Professor position at the Universidad Católica de Murcia (UCAM).Dr. Abellán has authored more than 70 peer-reviewed publications and one book. He has actively contributed to numerous conferences and workshops, serving in various capacities such as Technical Program Committee (TPC) member, Chair (program, publicity, session, and track chair), and co-organizer. Since October 2023, he has been an Associate Editor for both the ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization (TACO) journal and the Frontiers in Electronics journal. He is a full member of the HiPEAC European network, a Senior Member of IEEE, and a member of the Spanish SCIE and CAPA-H networks.Dr. Abellán has received several prestigious awards, including the HiPEAC 2011 collaboration grant, the Best Paper Award at IPDPS 2011, the HiPEAC Paper Awards in 2019, 2020, 2023, and 2024, as well as nominations for Best Paper Awards at NOCS 2021 and IPDPS 2022. In 2025, he and his collaborators received the distinguished \"Top Picks in Hardware and Embedded Security 2024\" award.  In June 2024, he was awarded the European R3 certificate, recognizing his status as an established researcher. His current research interests focus on architectural enhancements of GPU systems and the design of customized accelerators targeting both ML and Fully Homomorphic Encryption.Complete version of my CV: October 20252025 NEWS:November: Our paper \"QuCo: Efficient and Flexible Hardware-Driven Automatic Configuration of Tile Transfers in GPUs\" has been accepted to HPCA'26.
