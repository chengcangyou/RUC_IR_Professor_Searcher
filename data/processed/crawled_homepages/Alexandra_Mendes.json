I am also a member of the Formal Methods Teaching Committee and a Fellow of The Higher Education Academy (HEA). In 2023, I was a Visiting Researcher at Carnegie Mellon University under the CMU Portugal Program, hosted at CyLab Security and Privacy Institute. I was a recipient of the Amazon Research Award in Automated Reasoning in the Fall 2024 call. Finally, I am also a senior researcher at INESC TEC.My research focuses on encouraging a wider adoption of software verification by creating tools and methods that hide the complexities of verifying software. Much of my most recent work overlaps with the area of software engineering.InterestsSoftware ReliabilitySoftware VerificationSoftware EngineeringFormal MethodsInnovative User InterfacesEducationPhD in Computer ScienceUniversity of Nottingham, UKBSc in Mathematics and Computer ScienceMinho University, PortugalFeatured PublicationsView all the publicationsFrancisco Oliveira, Alexandra Mendes, Carolina Carreira (2025).
