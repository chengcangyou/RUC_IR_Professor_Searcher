Currently, I'm Principal Investigator at University of Glasgow on the EU project dAIEDGE and the UKRI APRIL AI Hub project SECDA-DSE, and Co-Investigator on the EPSRC project IDEAL. I was Principal Investigator (November 2021 - August 2023) on the EPSRC PETRAS project MAISE (Multimodal AI-based Security at the Edge) and Co-Investigator on the UKRI \"Digital Security by Design\" projects AppControl and Morello-HAT. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate (January 2014 - August 2018) with the CArD Group at the Institute for Computing Systems Architecture in the School of Informatics at The University of Edinburgh, where I worked on the H2020 BONSEYES project and the EPSRC AnyScale Applications project. I joined the ARCO Research Group in the Department of Computer Architecture at Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya - BarcelonaTech in March 2012, when I was a Postdoctoral Researcher until Dec 2013. I received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from Universitat Politecnica de Valencia in Sept 2004 and Feb 2012, respectively. I was a member with the Networking Research Group (Sept 2005 - Feb 2012) and also with the Parallel Architectures Group (Dec 2009 - Feb 2012) in the Department of Computing Engineering at Universitat Politecnica de Valencia. I'm a senior member of IEEE and ACM and a member of HiPEAC.
