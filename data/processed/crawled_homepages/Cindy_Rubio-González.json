If interested, please apply to UC Davis here and include my name in your graduate admission application (you can also send me an e-mail, please include your CV). Short Biography Dr. Rubio is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Davis. Prior to that position, she was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. She received her Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Dr. Rubio's work spans the areas of Software Engineering, Programming Languages and High-Performance Computing, with a focus on program analysis and testing for automated bug finding and program optimization. She is particularly interested in the reliability and performance of systems software and scientific applications. Dr. Rubio is a recipient of several awards including DOE Early Career Award, NSF CAREER Award, Facebook Testing and Verification Research Award, Facebook Probability and Programming Research Award, Hellman Fellowship, and UC Davis CAMPOS Faculty Award. Dr. Rubio earned her M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee and her B.S. in Computer Engineering from Saltillo Institute of Technology (Mexico). She also holds a B.M. in Piano Performance from the Autonomous University of Coahuila (Mexico).
