I received my Ph.D in Department of Electrical Engineering at Princeton University, and Bachelor's degree in Physics at Peking University. I have a broad interest in building trustworthy, efficient and intelligent systems. I do research mainly for fun. I find great satisfactory in seeing interesting ideas take shape, being concretely implemented, validated, and well-documentedâfar more rewarding than simply getting them published. I teach cyber security related courses for undergraduate students and master students at NTU. I am truly enjoying working with a team of brillient PhD students and research staffs, and exploring the unknown world together. I feel much happier seeing them achieve greater success than achieving it myself. In fact, they have indeed accomplished more than I have.
