In particular, I am involved in investigating the suitability of certain number-theoretic structures and problems as bases for public-key cryptosystems, enabling applications such as secure key-exchange and digital signatures. The efficiency of such cryptosystems is tested by implementing the best-known algorithms and devising improvements. The security is tested by developing sequential and distributed algorithms for solving the underlying number-theoretic problem. Some current interests are: algorithms in algebraic number fields, especially quadratic fields (efficient arithmetic in the class group, discrete logarithm computation, class group computation, regulator computation), analogous algorithms in function fields (aka hyperelliptic curves) Publication list Course Offerings This page last modified: http://www.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~jacobs/index.html",
