Computer Science University of York About me I am a Professor in the Department of Computer Science, University of York where I lead the Vision, Graphics and Learning (VGL) research group. I was a Royal Academy of Engineering/The Leverhulme Trust Senior Research Fellow from 2019-2020. I am an Associate Editor of the journal Pattern Recognition. My research interests span vision, graphics and ML. Specifically, physics-based and 3D computer vision, shape and appearance modelling and the application of statistics and machine learning to these areas. The application areas in which I most commonly work are face/body analysis and synthesis, surveying and mapping, object capture and inverse rendering. A wide variety of tools and areas of maths are often useful in my research such as: convex optimisation, nonlinear optimisation, manifold learning, learning/optimisation on manifolds, computational geometry and low level computer vision (e.g. features and correspondence). I supervise a team of nine PhD students. I have published over 100 papers, many in the top conferences and journals in the field.
