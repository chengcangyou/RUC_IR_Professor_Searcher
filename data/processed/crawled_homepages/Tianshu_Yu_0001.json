I will be visiting MILA - Quebec AI Institute 4 months (Aug - Nov) 2025. Our paper with ChemLex on AI4Chemistry was accepted by Nature Communications. [2025.5] Brief Intro I joined SDS@CUHKSZ as an assistant professor on Sep, 2021. Previously I got my Ph.D. in computer science at Arizona State University, advised by professor Baoxin Li. My research interest covers several aspects of machine learning and discrete optimization. Generally, I like investigating theory and applications on machine learning of combinatorial problems on graph, and seeking its interpretation under deep learning framework. Currently, I am also interested in applying machine learning to solve traditional problems in science (AI4Science), especially in chemistry and material areas. Experience Oct 2021 - Jan 2024, AIRS, associate researcher (part-time) May 2020 - August 2020, AWS - Seattle, applied scientist intern. My mentors include Hao Li and Gurumurthy Swaminathan.
