See my CV and publications. I work with a great group of students and postdocs. Machine Learning at Columbia Columbia has a thriving machine learning community, with many faculty and researchers across departments. The Machine Learning at Columbia mailing list is a good source of information about talks and other events on campus. (To subscribe, send email to machine-learning-columbia+subscribe@googlegroups.com.) Teaching In Fall 2025 I am teaching STCS 6701: Probabilistic Models and Machine Learning. It is a doctoral course, joint in Statistics and Computer Science. See the course website for the syllabus and other information.. STCS 6701 is open to all students at Columbia. If you are interested, please join the waiting list. We will admit students after the first week of the semester. Note we first give priority to PhD students and then admit masters and undergraduates. (In the past, there has been space for anyone who would like to take the course.) All my earlier courses are here. Office hours My office hours are on Wednesdays, 4:00P - 5:00P in Mudd 430. Coming to my office hours is much easier than using email to make an appointment. Sometimes they are canceled. Be sure to check the calendar.",
