At the beginning of July, 2020, after three wonderful years as the Founding Dean of the School of Computing and Information at the University of Pittsburgh, I stepped down and will focus on research and the Institute for Modeling and Managing Complicated Systems (momacs). From 2013 to 2017 I was a program manager in DARPA's Information Innovation Office, where I designed and managed the Big Mechanism and Communicating with Computers and World Modelers programs. I was on loan to DARPA from the University of Arizona, where I served as head of Computer Science and founded the School of Information: Science, Technology and Arts (SISTA, now part of SI). My research is in aspects of artificial intelligence and cognitive science. I am interested in language, communication, and AI methods to help us understand very complicated systems such as cell signaling pathways and food/water/energy interactions.
