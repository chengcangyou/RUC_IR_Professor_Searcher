Special Topics: Vision Meets Machine Learning My critic/sicentific interest: Machine learning (ML) gives us today the best tool/method for prediction. Cudos! more research in this area is very likely to improve the field. However, we don't know what it learns. If Newtonian physics was developed by collecting a lot of video data of falling objects as input and applying ML techniques of today, the predictions for falling objects would likely be very accurate, air resistance would likely be accounted for. However, it would not uncover the physical laws F=ma, where F is the gravitational force and a=9.8 m/s^2 is the acceleration due to gravity. We may not even learn that mass is a relevant quantity. Visual understanding (and discovery) has not advanced much lately. 251 Mercer Street, Room 407 New York, NY 10011, USA. dg1 @ nyu.edu +1-212-998-3235 Revisiting Quantum Theory: Quantum Elastica , April 2025 Phase Space Spin Entropy , April 2024 Quantum Knowledge in Phase Space , August 2023 On Quantum Entropy , September 2022",
