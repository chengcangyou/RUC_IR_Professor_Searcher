The volumes focus on computing systems, although the methods may also be applied to other systems. Like many parallel or concurrent systems, computing systems often lead to conﬂicts because processes attempt to access resources simultaneously or with time overlapping. Such conﬂict may cause errors, process congestion, and system deadlocks. Moreover, when planning a cost-effective system, the policies, mechanisms, systems’ structures, and the respective phenomena are usually hard to represent by deterministic models. On the other hand, such systems commonly have statistical regularities that make them suitable for dealing with stochastic processes and statistics that quantify the collected data’s central tendencies, variability, and shapes. Due to its size, the document was divided into two volumes. The ﬁrst volume covers from Chapter 1 to Chapter 14, whose subtitle is “Performance Modeling and Background.” The second volume encompasses from Chapter 16 to Chapter 26 and has the subtitle “Reliability and Availability Modeling, Measuring and Workload, and Lifetime Data Analysis.” Amazon Routledge Comments Off on Book Release MoDCS at the 2025 Finep Innovation Awards Published on November 18, 2025\t\tby Vinícius Almeida in Events, MoDCS, Research The project “Integrated Advances in Smart Mobility, Vehicle Safety, and Energy Efficiency”, developed by MoDCS, was a finalist in the Northeast Stage of the 2025 Finep Innovation Award. The initiative proposes technological solutions to critical challenges in urban mobility, focusing on two-wheel electric vehicles, connectivity, embedded systems, and energy efficiency. The project employs advanced IoT and edge computing technologies to reduce emissions, improve road safety, and foster innovation among companies and startups. Its impact is strengthened by the collaboration of a network of ICTs, bringing together UFPE, IFPE, UFAPE, SECTI-PE, UFC, and UFJF, which work jointly on the development and validation of the solutions. According to the coordinator, Professor Paulo Maciel, the nomination “recognizes the collective effort to transform advanced research into concrete solutions for sustainable mobility.” He highlights that the result reflects decades of the group’s expertise in modeling, performance, and reliability of complex systems, reinforcing MoDCS’s relevance within Brazil’s innovation ecosystem. This recognition strengthens a trajectory marked by strategic partnerships, high-impact scientific production, and a continuous contribution to the country’s technological progress.
