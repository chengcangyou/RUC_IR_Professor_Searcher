Young Professor, Chairperson Department of Computer Science and Engineering The Chinese University of Hong Kong Research areas: VLSI CAD, algorithms, combinatorial optimization, AI Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight. Proverbs 3:5-6 About Him About me and What's New Evangeline Young received her B.Sc. and M.Phil. degree in Computer Science from The Chinese University of Hong Kong and received her Ph.D. degree from The University of Texas at Austin in 1999. BTW, she accepted Jesus on Oct 20, 1996. She joined the Department of Computer Science and Engineering in the Chinese University of Hong Kong as an assistant professor in 1999 and is now a professor in the same department. Her research interests include CAD of VLSI circuits, algorithms, combinatorial optimization and AI. She has served in the program committees of DAC, ICCAD, ASP-DAC, ISPD, GLSVLSI, DATE and the editorial boards of IEEE TCAD, ACM TODAES and Integration, the VLSI Journal. She also served in the executive committee of ISPD and ICCAD. She is an IEEE fellow. We won Second Place in the 2025 ISPD Contest on Performance-Driven Large Scale Global Routing. We won Second Place in the 2024 CAD Contest at ICCAD on Scalable Logic Gate Sizing Using ML Techniques and GPU Acceleration. We won the Championship in the Special Honour Track of the ISPD 2024 Contest on GPU/ML-Enhanced Large Scale Global Routing, and won the Second Place in the Main Track of the same contest. We won the Second Place in the Runtime-First FPGA Interchange Routing Contest at FPGA 2024. Tianji Liu received Best Paper Award from ASP-DAC 2024 for the work \"FineMap: A Fine-grained GPU-parallel LUT Mapping Engine\". Congratulations!!! We won Second Runner-up in the 2023 MLCAD FPGA Macro Placement Contest and the 2023 CAD Contest at ICCAD on 3D Placement with Macros. Fangzhou Wang and Jinwei Liu received Best Paper Award from ISPD 2023 for the work \"FastPass: Fast Pin Access Analysis with Incremental SAT Solving\". Congratulations!!! We won Second Runner-up in the 2023 ISPD Contest on Advanced Security Closure of Physical Layouts. We won First Runner-up in the 2022 CAD Contest at ICCAD on Microarchitecture Design Space Exploration, and Honourable Mention on 3D Placement with D2D Vertical Connections. We won Second Runner-up in the 2022 ISPD Contest on Security Closure of Physical Layouts. We won Championship in the 2021 CAD Contest at ICCAD on the GPU-Accelerated Logic Rewriting Problem, and First Runner-up on the Routing with Cell Movement Advanced Problem. We won First Runner-up in the 2021 ISPD Contest on Wafer-Scale Physics Modelling. We won Championship in the 2020 CAD Contest at ICCAD on the Routing with Cell Movement Problem. Gengjie Chen, a former PhD student, received the ACM SIGDA Ouststanding PhD Dissertation Award in 2020. We won Championship in the 2020 ISPD Contest on Wafer-Scale Deep Learning Accelerator Placement. We won Championship in the 2019 CAD Contest at ICCAD on the LEF/DEF Based Open-Source Global Router Problem, and the Second Runner Up in the same contest on the System-level FPGA Routing with Timing Division Multiplexing Technique Problem. We won Championships in the 2019 ISPD Initial Detailed RoutingContest and the 2018 CAD Contest at ICCAD on Obstacle-Avoiding On-Track Bus Routing, and the Second Place in the 2018 CAD Contest at ICCAD on Timing-Aware Fill Insertion! Gengjie Chen, a former PhD student, received the First Places in the ACM Student Research Competition Grand Finals and the ACM SIGDA Student Research Competition in 2018. In 2017, we received Best Paper Awards for the following publications: Gengjie Chen, Peishan Tu, Evangeline F. Y. Young, \"SALT: Provably good routing topology by a novel steiner shallow-light tree algorithm\", ICCAD 2017: 569-576. Hang Zhang, Fengyuan Zhu, Haocheng Li, Evangeline F. Y. Young, Bei Yu: \"Bilinear Lithography Hotspot Detection\", ISPD 2017: 7-14. Peishan Tu, Wing-Kai Chow, Evangeline F. Y. Young, \"Timing driven routing tree construction\", SLIP 2017: 1-8. Our group has won the championships in the 2016 CAD Contest at ICCAD on NP3: Non-exact Projective NPNP Boolean Matching and 2015 CAD Contest at ICCAD on 3D-ICON: 3D Interlayer Cooling Optimized Network.. We also won the first runner up in the 2018 ISPD Initial Detailed Routing Contest and the 2016 ISPD Routability-Driven FPGA Placement Contest. We won the second runner up in the 2017 ISPD Clock-Aware FPGA Placement Contest, 2015 CAD Contest at ICCAD on Incremental Timing-driven Placement and the 2014/2015 ISPD Detailed Routing-driven Placement Contest. In 2013, we won the championships in the 2013 CAD Contest at ICCAD on both Placement Finishing and Mask Optimization.(CUHK has historically won ALL the championships in this contest!) In 2012, we won the second place in 2012 CAD Contest at ICCAD on Design Hierarchy Aware Routability-driven Placement. In the past, we had also won the championship in the ISPD 2011 Routability-Driven Placement Contest (EETimes Coverage), the second place in the DAC 2012 Routability-Driven Placement Contest and the first runner-up in the ISPD 2010 High Performance Clock Network Synthesis Contest (EETimes Coverage).
