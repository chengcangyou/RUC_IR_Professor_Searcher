Accept optional cookies Reject optional cookies Cookie settings Professor Barry Porter Professor of Adaptive Systems Research Overview I research and develop cutting-edge emergent software platforms to solve problems of software complexity and optimality, with the aim of redefining the role of the programmer to be a designer of intent rather than a writer of low-level behavioural fragments. To do this I work heavily with component models, meta-software platforms and machine learning. I am particularly interested in distributed systems elements of this including cloud integration with small devices like sensor nodes; malleable green computing; multi-core software organisation; and real-time software visualisation.
