I am a researcher interested in usable security and privacy. I graduated in computer science and specialized in information security and developed an interest in usability and human factors in computer security. Since October 2023, I am a tenure-track faculty at CISPA and the lead for the MaxLab. I received my Ph.D. from Ruhr University Bochum, where I focused on exploring the usability and security of password-based user authentication. Later, I did a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy in Bochum, Germany. My research focuses on computer security, privacy, and human-computer interaction (HCI). In particular, I am working on reinforcing the security of passwords by driving the adoption of two-factor, risk-based, and passwordless authentication. In the area of usable privacy, I am exploring users' perceptions of online behavioral advertising, data collection, and tracking, and I am analyzing the privacy risks of disruptive technologies.
