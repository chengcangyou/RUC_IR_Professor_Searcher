I received my Ph.D. in 1978 from the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab, and was a Member of Technical Staff at AT&T Bell Laboratories before coming to Penn in 1987. I served as chair of Penn's Computer and Information Science Department, as chair of the Penn Faculty Senate, as well as president of the Association for Computational Linguistics. I served as chair of the Advisory Committee of the Center of Excellence in Human Language Technology at John Hopkins University and as Technical Advisor to that Center. I was named a Fellow of the American Association of Artificial Intelligence in 1992 and a Founding Fellow of the Association for Computational Linguistics in 2011. I created and ran the Penn Treebank Project through the mid-1990s which developed the primary training corpus that led to a breakthrough in the accuracy of natural language parsers. I was a co-PI on the OntoNotes Project and PI for an ARO-funded MURI project to investigate natural language understanding for human-robot interaction with co-PIs at Stanford, Cornell, UMass Amherst, UMass Lowell and George Mason. Until recently I was PI of a project on completely unsupervised morphology acquisition under DARPA LORELEI, working with Prof. Charles Yang in Linguistics and then worked with a team at ISI Boston on simulations of child language acquisition funded by the DARPA GAILA AIX Program. My current research interests include: statistical natural language processing and cognitively plausible models for automatic acquisition of linguistic structure. My past PhD students have gone on to teach at such schools as MIT, Johns Hopkins, University of Arizona, Queens College, SUNY Stony Brook and the Navy Postgraduate School, and such industrial research labs as Google, IBM Research, BBN Technologies, and Microsoft Research.
