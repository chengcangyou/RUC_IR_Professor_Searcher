My research interests include: Current: Learning and inference in deep generative models and probabilistic graphical models. General: Probabilistic graphical models, machine learning and data mining, frameworks for representing and solving complex decision problems. See my publication list (official AAU research repository). Book: Bayesian Networks and Decision Graphs (second edition) available at Springer. Activities and news I have an opening for a PostDoc position on probabilistic machine learning. The Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning team gathers researchers from the three research units at the Department of Computer Science, Aalborg University. The 10th International Conference on Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM) will be organized here in Aalborg. The conference homepage (still under construction) can be found here. I have been a member of the AMIDST project, where we have been developing the AMIDST toolbox: A Java Toolbox for Scalable Probabilistic Machine Learning.
