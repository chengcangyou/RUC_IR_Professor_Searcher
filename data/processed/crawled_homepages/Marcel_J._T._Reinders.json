Reinders received his MSc degree in Applied Physics and a PhD degree in Elec¬trical Engineering from Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands, in 1990 and 1995, respectively. In 2005, he became a Professor in Bioinformatics within the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science at the Delft University of Technology in which he now heads the ‘Pattern Recognition and Bioinformatics’ section. In 2010 he became one of the scientific directors of the Netherlands Bioinformatics Centre (NBIC). The background of Marcel Reinders is within pattern recognition. Besides studying fundamental issues, he applies pattern recognition techniques to the areas of bioinformatics, computer vision and context-aware recommender systems. His special interest goes towards understanding complex systems (such as biological systems) that are severely under-sampled. He (co-)authored more than 200 scientific papers of which more than 75 in peer-reviewed journals. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFltjqmiP8A Deel deze pagina: Facebook Linkedin Twitter Email WhatsApp Deel deze pagina Marcel Reinders +31 15 27 86424 m.j.t.reinders@tudelft.nl Van Mourik Broekmanweg 6 2628 XE Delft The Netherlands Room 6W.600",
