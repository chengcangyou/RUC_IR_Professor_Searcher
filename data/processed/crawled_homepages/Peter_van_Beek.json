I received my PhD in 1990 from the University of Waterloo and at that time joined the faculty at the University of Alberta. Ten years later I returned to Waterloo. My research interests span the field of Artificial Intelligence with a focus on representation and reasoning, constraint programming, constraint satisfaction, and applied machine learning. I have co-authored seven research papers which have won awards, and I have served on the program committees of many conferences and on the editorial boards of several journals. From 2005-2009, I served as Editor-in-Chief of the journal Constraints, a forum for research in constraint programming and constraint satisfaction and optimization. I am a Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI); a Fellow of the Canadian Artificial Intelligence Association (CAIAC), and a Fellow of the Asia-Pacific Artificial Intelligence Association (AAIA). Prospective students I am not accepting new undergraduate research assistants or new graduate students.
