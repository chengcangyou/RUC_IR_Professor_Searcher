Saul has also consulted for various well-known companies as an Expert Witness involving patent infringement matters. He is also the creator and maintainer of Timelapse image analyser, an open-source free software system used internationally by scientists to encode data from thousands to millions of camera trap images. Saul is a prolific author who has authored and edited several books and published many refereed articles, available at his research web site. He is also known for his strong commitment in making his tools, systems, and educational material readily available to other researchers and educators. ---- A slightly longer bio is also available.
