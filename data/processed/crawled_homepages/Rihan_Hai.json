Before joining TU Delft, I received my Ph.D. degree from RWTH Aachen University, and my Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees from Tsinghua University. My research focuses on data lakes, data management for machine learning, and quantum data management. My goal is to build intelligent, efficient, and future-ready data systems that seamlessly integrate classical and quantum computing. My work bridges data management, machine learning, and quantum technologies to advance scalable AI, sustainable infrastructures, and novel computing paradigms.
