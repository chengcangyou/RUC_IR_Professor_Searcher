More projects » Currently teaching Matrix Computations (CS 6210) [F22] [F19] [F16] [F13] [F12] [F09] MW 10:10-11:25 in Gates 114 (or Zoom). Numerical linear algebra. Basic theory, efficient algorithms, and enough error analysis to avoid numerical embarrassment (we hope)! Direct and iterative methods for linear systems, least squares, and eigenvalues. Projects (CS [45]999) See my list of projects! If nothing on the list appeals but you think youâd like to work with me on something, come knock on my door. I donât bite.
