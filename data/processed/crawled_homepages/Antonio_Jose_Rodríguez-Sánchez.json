Associate Professor Office: ICT building, 3N05 Phone: +43 512 507 53270 Email: antonio.rodriguez-sanchez@uibk.ac.at Assoz.Prof. Antonio Rodríguez-Sánchez, PhD. is currently an Associate Professor in the Intelligent and Interactive Systems group of the department of Computer Science at the Universität Innsbruck (Austria). He was born in Santiago de Compostela (A Coruña), a beautiful city in the north-west of Spain. He completed his Ph.D. at the Center for Vision Research (York University, Toronto, Canada) on modeling attention and intermediate areas of the visual cortex under the supervision of Prof. John K. Tsotsos (Canada Research Chair) in 2010. He obtained the degree of M.Sc. in Computer Science at the Universidade da Coruña (Spain) in 1998. He received his B.Sc. in Computer Science at Universidad de Córdoba (Spain) with Honors and did his Bachelor Thesis at the Université de La Rochelle (France). He is an ELLIS member and has published more than 70 publications (~1400 citations, h-index 18) in international journals and conferences in Machine/Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Computational neuroscience and Robotics. His current research interests include different areas of artificial intelligence: Explainable AI, computational neuroscience, (deep) neural networks, computer vision, machine learning and robotics. He is also interested from an “amateur” point of view in other non computer related scientific fields such as physiscs, mathematics, biology, history, sports (skiing, swimming, hiking, fencing) and photography.
