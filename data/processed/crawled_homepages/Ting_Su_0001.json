Previously, he was a postdoctoral scholar at ETH Zurich, Switzerland (2019-2020), in the group of Prof. Zhendong Su. He worked as a postdoctoral research fellow with Prof. Yang Liu in Cyber Security Lab (CSL), NTU, Singapore (2016-2019). He got his Ph.D in computer science from East China Normal University (ECNU), Shanghai, China (2011-2016), and was surpervised by Prof. Jifeng He and Prof. Geguang Pu. He also had one-year visit in University of California, Davis (UCD), USA (2014-2015), and was advised by Prof. Zhendong Su. He also worked as a software engineer intern in Synopsys, and a research scientist in Rolls-Royce@NTU Research Lab (2016-2017). He is a recipient of 国家海外青年人才计划. His research focuses on developing effective methodologies, techniques and tools to improve software quality, reliability and security.

His research on symbolic execution has led to SmartRocket Unit, a commercial automated unit testing tool, which is serving many companies in China for testing industrial embedded software; his continuous research on mobile app analysis and fuzzing has led to several tools and dataset, e.g., Stoat (cited 460+), Themis, Kea/Kea2 and FastBot (starred 1100+). He is also actively developing a course (ecnu-sa-lab) on software testing, analysis and verification for undergraduate/graduate students. I am always looking for well-motivated Postdoc, PhD, Master and Undergraduate students to join our research group.
