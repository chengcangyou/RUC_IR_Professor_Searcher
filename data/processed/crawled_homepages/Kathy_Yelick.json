Pepper Distinguished Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences and the Vice Chancellor for Research at UC Berkeley. She is also a Senior Faculty Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Her research is in high performance computing, programming languages, compilers, parallel algorithms, and automatic performance tuning. She currently leads the ExaBiome project on scalable tools for analyzing microbial data and co-leads the Berkeley Benchmarking and Optimization (Bebop) group. She was the Associate Dean for Research in the Division of Computing, Data Science and Society at UC Berkeley from 2020 through 2021; the Associate Laboratory Director for Computing Sciences at LBNL from 2010 through 2019; and prior to that she led the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC). Yelick is a member of National Academy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and she is a Fellow of both the Association for Computing Machinery and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
