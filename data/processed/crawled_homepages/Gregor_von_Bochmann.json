Practical applications of these methods are pursued in relation with network protocols (e.g. Internet and optical networks), Web Services, workflow management, peer-to-peer systems, and analysis of Rich Internet Applications. In the past, we have also done much work in the areas of quality of service management for distributed multimedia applications and development of test suites with known fault coverage, diagnostics and testability.
