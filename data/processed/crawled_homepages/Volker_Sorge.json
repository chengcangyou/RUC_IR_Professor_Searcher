Volker has played a pivotal role in the transformation of developing web technology standards, the common practices by STEM publishers and accessibility support workers for visually impaired readers. The work by Dr Sorge has led to the implementation of production-ready open source software technology for accessible rendering of mathematics via aural and tactile transcription of formulae. For more information, please see Volker's homepage. Research Interests Scientific Document Analysis:Mathematical OCR, Formula Recognition, Diagram Recognition, Semantic Document Analysis, Handwritten Documents. Accessibility:Accessibility of scientific content such as formulas and diagrams. Computer Algebra:Symbolic Computation with Underspecified Matrices and correctness of Computer Algebra Algorithms Logic and Automated Reasoning:Integration of Reasoning Techniques, Automatic Mathematical discovery, Logical representation of intuitive objects.
