Prior to joining Concordia, I worked as a Staff Researcher at Huawei Canada and completed a Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of Alberta. My research interests lie in machine learning and computer vision, with a recent focus on 3D AIGC, embodied AI, human motion generation, and 3D reconstruction. I currently serve as an Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on Multimedia and as an Area Chair for NeurIPS 2025 and ICLR 2026. .NewsServing as an Area Chair for ICLR'26Serving as an Area Chair for NeurIPS'25Serving as an Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on Multimedia(TMM)Paper on 4D Human Stylization is accepted by CVIU'25Paper on Point Cloud Compeletion is accepted by NeurIPS'25Paper on Sketch to Pose prediction is accepted by SIGGRAPH Asia'25Paper on Text-3D avatar is accepted by ICCV'25Paper on 3D GS inpainting is accepted by CVPR'25Paper on Object replacement is accepted by CVPR'25Paper on Motion Synthesis is accepted by ICLR'25Paper on Event Human Pose is accepted by TCSVT'25Selected Publication   (Full)3D AIGCDecorate3D: Text-Driven High-Quality Texture Generation for Mesh Decoration in the WildYanhui Guo, Xinxin Zuo, Peng Dai, Juwei Lu, Xiaolin Wu, Li Cheng, Youliang Yan, Songcen Xu and Xiaofei WuNeural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2023 [PDF] [Project] TM2T: Stochastic and Tokenized Modeling for the Reciprocal Generation of 3D Human Motions and TextsChuan Guo, Xinxin Zuo, Sen Wang,  Li Cheng European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2022 [PDF] [Project]Generating Diverse and Natural 3D Human Motions from Text Chuan Guo, Shihao Zou, Xinxin Zuo, Sen Wang,  Wei Ji, Xingyu Li,  Li Cheng IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2022 [PDF] [Code] [Project]Action2video: Generating Videos of Human 3D Actions Chuan Guo, Xinxin Zuo, Sen Wang, Xinshuang Liu, Shihao Zou, Minglun Gong, Li Cheng International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV) , 2022[PDF] [Video] [Project]Avatar ModelingDetailed Avatar Recovery from Single Image Hao Zhu, Xinxin Zuo, Haotian Yang, Sen Wang, Xun Cao, Ruigang YangIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), 2022[PDF]  [Code]  [Project] SparseFusion: Dynamic Human Avatar Modeling from Sparse RGBD Images Xinxin Zuo, Sen Wang, Jiangbin Zheng, Weiwei Yu, Minglun Gong, Ruigang Yang, Li ChengIEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM), 2021[PDF] [Video]3D Human Shape Reconstruction from a Polarization Image Shihao Zou, Xinxin Zuo, Yiming Qian, Sen Wang, Chi Xu, Minglun Gong, Li ChengEuropean Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2020[PDF]  [Dataset]  [Project]3D Object ReconstructionObject Wake-up: 3D Object Rigging from a Single Image Ji Yang, Xinxin Zuo,  Sen Wang, Zhenbo Yu, Xingyu Li, Bingbing Ni, Minglun Gong, Li ChengEuropean Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2022 [PDF] [Project]Detailed Surface Geometry and Albedo Recovery from RGB-D Video Under Natural Illumination Xinxin Zuo, Sen Wang, Jiangbin Zheng, Zhigeng Pan, Ruigang Yang IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), 2020[PDF]   [Project] Interactive Visual Hull Refinement for Specular and Transparent Object Surface ReconstructionXinxin Zuo, Chao Du, Sen Wang, Jiangbin Zheng, Ruigang Yang IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015[PDF] [Video] [Project]Google SitesReport abuseGoogle SitesReport abuse",
