I'm a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Data Science and, by courtesy, Computer Science at the University of Virginia. I also have appointments in UVA's Comprehensive Cancer Center and National Security & Data Policy Institute. Before joining UVA in Fall 2023, I was a postdoc at MIT CSAIL working with Marzyeh Ghassemi. I received my PhD in Data Science from WPI where I was advised by Elke Rundensteiner and Xiangnan Kong.ResearchMy research group works on machine learning and natural language processing. We work to enable responsible model deployment in ever-changing environments, especially for healthcare.Active directions and highlights:Continually monitoring and updating big modelsAging with GRACE: Lifelong Model Editing with Discrete Key-Value Adapters (NeurIPS'23) (blog post)TAXI: Evaluating Categorical Knowledge Editing for Language Models (ACL'24)Composable Interventions for Language Models (ICLR'25)Understanding the Limits of Lifelong Knowledge Editing (ICML'25) (Available on EasyEdit!)BalancEdit: Dynamically Balancing the Generality-Locality Trade-off in Multi-modal Model Editing  (ICML'25)Model Editing with External Graph-Based Memory (Findings of ACL'25)Math Neurosurgery: Isolating Language Models' Math Reasoning Abilities Using Only Forward Passes (ACL'25)Lifelong Knowledge Editing requires Better Regularization (Findings of EMNLP'25)Time series and multi-modalityAre Language Models Actually Useful for Time Series Forecasting?
