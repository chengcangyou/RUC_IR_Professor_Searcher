My core research is on theory, methods, and accessible software for causal inference on time series data with applications to Earth system sciences and beyond. I studied physics at Humboldt University Berlin (Germany) and UC Santa Cruz (USA) and obtained my PhD with research at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in 2014. From 2016 to 2017 I was a James S. McDonnell Fellow at Imperial College London. From 2017 to 2024, I headed the Causal Inference Group at DLR. In 2020, I won an ERC Starting Grant with my interdisciplinary project CausalEarth and founded another branch of my research group at Technische Universität (TU) Berlin in 2021. My group’s website is at www.causalinferencelab.com. My full CV is Jakob_Runge_CV. I am currently writing a book on Causal Inference for Time Series Data and an accessible Medium blog series on causal inference. Here’s a video of my inaugural lecture at Uni Potsdam (German only, English slides).
