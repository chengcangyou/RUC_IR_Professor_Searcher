I am working on deep learning and foundation models, scientific learning and world models, transfer learning and model adaptation. Our Machine Learning Group is interested in powering machine learning for representation, perception, prediction, and generation of big data with a good tradeoff between accuracy, efficiency, generalizability, and transferability. Our mission is to solve open problems and enable major applications in science and engineering, including Artificial General Intelligence, AI for Science, and AI for Software.
