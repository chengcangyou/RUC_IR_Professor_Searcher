Laura has been working on the extension of Multiparty Session Types with logics to enable Design by Contract for concurrency, with time constraints to enable effective verification of real-time and reliable distributed systems. Research interests I belong to the following research groups:Programming Languages and Systems GroupMoreover, I am Associate Member of the Kent Interdisciplinary Research Centre in Cyber Security (KirCCS), and a collaborator of the Mobility Reading Group where I am contributing to extending Scribble with assertions and time.
