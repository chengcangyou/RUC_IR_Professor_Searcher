His current projects are robust computational geometry,model acquisition for computer graphics, generalized camera models, and robot path planning. He has also researched mechanical design algorithms using configuration spaces. The research led to practical design software for kinematic analysis, simulation, tolerancing, and parametric design of mechanical systems with higher pairs and changing contact topologies. The software has been used at Ford Motors for transmission design and at Sandia National Laboratory for micro-mechanism design.
