Entre estos cambios figura la creciente necesidad de incorporar herramientas de e-learning que den soporte al estudiante cuando se haya fuera del ambito universitario. En este articulo describimos nuestra experiencia, utilizando la intranet que ofrece la Facultat d&#39;Informatica de Barcelona (FIB) en la asignatura Projecte de Sistemes Operatius (ProSO). El objetivo es el de proporcionar al alumno un entorno virtual para el seguimiento de la asignatura que complemente las clases presenciales. Esta experiencia ha resultado satisfactoria y se continua usando. Asimismo, proponemos una serie de funcionalidades que consideramos necesarias para apoyar de manera efectiva este tipo de cursos.Download MedSecurance Project: Advanced Security-for-Safety Assurance for Medical Device IoT (IoMT)Studies in health technology and informatics, May 18, 2023The MedSecurance project focus on identifying new challenges in cyber security with focus on hard... more The MedSecurance project focus on identifying new challenges in cyber security with focus on hardware and software medical devices in the context of emerging healthcare architectures. In addition, the project will review best practice and identify gaps in the guidance, particularly the guidance stipulated by the medical device regulation and directives. Finally, the project will develop comprehensive methodology and tooling for the engineering of trustworthy networks of inter-operating medical devices, that shall have security-for-safety by design, with a strategy for device certification and certifiable dynamic network composition, ensuring that patient safety is safeguarded from malicious cyber actors and technology \"accidents\".Download An Architecture for Providing Personalized Digital HealthStudies in health technology and informatics, May 18, 2023Patients need mechanisms to integrate health information coming from different sources, including... more Patients need mechanisms to integrate health information coming from different sources, including personal devices. This would lead to Personalized Digital Health (PDH). HIPAMS (Health Information Protection And Management System) is a modular and interoperable secure architecture that helps in achieving this objective and building a Framework for PDH. The paper presents HIPAMS and how it supports PDH.Download Adding Security and Privacy to Genomic Information RepresentationPubMed, 2019Provision of security and privacy to genomic data is a key issue in current genomic information r... more Provision of security and privacy to genomic data is a key issue in current genomic information representation. Existing formats do not give a solution to these issues (or they provide a partial one), so new solutions are demanded. MPEG-G (ISO/IEC 23092, Genomic Information Representation) is an International Standard for the representation of genomic information being defined by the MPEG Committee (Moving Pictures Expert Group, ISO/IEC JTC1 SC29/WG11). We provide flexible protection to the information stored inside the MPEG-G format with a combination of security techniques and privacy rules.Download jmpegg 1.0 – the pure java implementation of the MPEG-G ISO/IEC 23092 standardF1000Research, 2019jmpegg library provides MPEG-G files encoding/decoding features.

The library also supports conversion between MPEG-G and well-known genomic formats.Download Security and Privacy when Applying FAIR Principles to Genomic InformationStudies in Health Technology and Informatics, 2020Making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) is a good approach when data ... more Making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) is a good approach when data needs to be shared. However, security and privacy are still critical aspects. In the FAIRification process, there is a need both for de-identification of data and for license attribution. The paper analyses some of the issues related to this process when the objective is sharing genomic information. The main results are the identification of the already existing standards that could be used for this purpose and how to combine them. Nevertheless, the area is quickly evolving and more specific standards could be specified.Download FAIR Aspects of a Health Information Protection and Management SystemMethods of Information in MedicineBackground Privacy management is a key issue when dealing with storage and distribution of health... more Background Privacy management is a key issue when dealing with storage and distribution of health information. However, FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) principles when sharing information are in increasing demand in several organizations, especially for information generated in public-funded research projects. Objectives The two main objectives of the presented work are the definition of a secure and interoperable modular architecture to manage different kinds of medical content (xIPAMS [x, for Any kind of content, Information Protection And Management System] and HIPAMS [Health Information Protection And Management System]), and the application of FAIR principles to that architecture in such a way that privacy and security are compatible with FAIR. Methods We propose the concept of xIPAMS as a modular architecture, following standards for interoperability, which defines mechanisms for privacy, protection, storage, search, and access to health-re...Download Provenance and Dynamic Consents for the Management of Medical DataStudies in health technology and informatics, Nov 3, 2022Medical data describe patient health information, both in healthy and disease conditions. In any ... more Medical data describe patient health information, both in healthy and disease conditions. In any case, health institutions need to ask for patient consent in order to provide their services. Patients usually give consent on a one-time basis, for a specific usage. Afterwards, if medical data usage is research, original patient consent does not apply and further consents should be required. On the other hand, provenance of medical data to verify the origin of health procedures is desirable, as digital health is increasing. We propose HIPAMS modular architecture to provide both provenance and dynamic consents for medical data as described in this paper.Download Reversible fingerprinting for genomic informationMultimedia Tools and Applications, 2020New genome sequencing technologies have simplified the generation of genomic data, making them mo... more New genome sequencing technologies have simplified the generation of genomic data, making them more common but in turn a likely target of attack. Security strategies have been devised such as restricting the amount of information that can be queried or using new encryption techniques. These solutions might not be enough if the entire file has to be shared, as the recipient might leak the accessible information. This contribution addresses this issue using watermarking. Each read in a genomic file is modified depending on its content and a secret key. This allows generating different watermarked instances of the original file. Each watermark acts as a fingerprint: if a leak occurs, the unique modifications of the instance points to who originated the unauthorized publication. Using the key, the modifications can be undone. This allows sharing a leak-discouraging version with which the relevance of a file can be assessed, and can be reversed to the original if needed.Download Implementation of Privacy and Security for a Genomic Information System Based on StandardsJournal of Personalized MedicineGenomic information is a very sensitive type of digital information as it not only applies to a p... more Genomic information is a very sensitive type of digital information as it not only applies to a person, but also to close relatives. Therefore, privacy provision is key to protecting genomic information from unauthorized access. It is worth noting that most of the current genomic information formats do not provide specific mechanisms by which to secure the stored information. In order to solve, among other things, the privacy provision issue, we proposed the GIPAMS (Genomic Information Protection And Management System",
