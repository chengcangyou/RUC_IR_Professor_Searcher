Moreover, I am an Associate Member of the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford.Until 2023, I was a Senior Research Associate in Algorithms and Complexity Theory at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford and member of the group of Leslie Ann Goldberg. Before, I was a Junior Research Fellow in Computer Science at Merton College, University of Oxford.I received my PhD in Computer Science at Saarland University and the Cluster of Excellence (MMCI), where I was supervised by Holger Dell. My research concerns computational counting problems. In particular, I am interested in the multivariate and exact complexity of counting problems that are infeasible from a classical point of view.Google SitesReport abuseGoogle SitesReport abuse",
