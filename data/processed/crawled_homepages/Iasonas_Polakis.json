(2009), and Ph.D. (2014) degrees in Computer Science from the University of Crete (Greece) while working as a research assistant in the Distributed Computing Systems Lab at FORTH. Prior to joining UIC, I was a postdoctoral research scientist in the Computer Science Department at Columbia University, and a member of the Network Security Lab. More information is available in my resume. Iâm looking for excited and motivated students to work with. Information for PhD applications at UIC can be found here. Research My research interests span several areas of security and privacy. In the past few years I have focused on understanding the security limitations of web browsers and web applications, exploring the privacy threats that users face, and designing robust countermeasures. Iâm also actively exploring the shortcomings of authentication and authorization mechanisms, and the robustness of bot-prevention systems. Ultimately my research focuses on understanding the Webâs threat landscape and developing countermeasures and privacy-preserving techniques for better protecting users.
