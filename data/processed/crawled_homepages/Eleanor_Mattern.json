My name is Eleanor \"Nora\" Mattern and I am the Director of the Sara Fine Institute and a teaching associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh's School of Computing and Information.  My current work focuses on library engagement with data about our communities.I am pleased to be part of the Civic Switchboard project, which aims to develop the capacity of academic and public libraries to be active partners in their civic data ecosystems. This project has been awarded an IMLS National Leadership Grant and two IMLS Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Grants.I previously worked as librarian and researcher at the University of Chicago Library, where I focused on designing and delivering scholarly communications services and supporting digital preservation activities. Before that, I held a joint appointment at the University of Pittsburgh as a Visiting Assistant Professor at the School of Computing and Information and Digital Scholarship Services at the University Library System. I earned my PhD in Library and Information Science from the University of Pittsburgh in 2014. This site overviews my civic data and user-focused work. Please contact me at emm225@pitt.edu and find my Google Scholar page here.Birding and weaving are my favorite things to do. 🐦Google SitesReport abuseGoogle SitesReport abuse",
