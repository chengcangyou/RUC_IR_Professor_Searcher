My research endeavors to elucidate the dynamics of science as a social and an intellectual (cognitive) endeavor by approaching science as a heterogeneous system comprising of people, ideas, documents, instruments, institutions, and policies situated in an historical context. Specifically, I strive to produce comprehensive, yet straightforward models based on theoretical and empirical findings from a wide range of fields (science, technology, and society (STS), science of science, information science, network science, economics, sociology, philosophy, history, etc.) in order to uncover and explain the fundamental principles that govern contemporary science. I serve on the editorial boards of Scientometrics and BioScience. I am an Associate Editor for Quantitative Science Studies, the Frontiers in Research Metrics and Analytics and Journal of Altmetrics. I received my PhD in Information Studies at University of California, Los Angeles.",
