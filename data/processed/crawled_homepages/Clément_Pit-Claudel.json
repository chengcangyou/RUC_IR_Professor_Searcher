Previously, I was a PhD candidate at MIT with Adam Chlipala and then a senior applied scientist at Amazon AWS. My research focuses on programming languages, compilers, and formal verification; my broader interests include systems engineering, hardware design languages, security, performance engineering, and type theory.Prospective students: hi! Check out this dedicated page and my lab's website.ResearchMy current research program is organized around three main axes:Extensible compilation (teaching compilers domain-specific optimization tricks to compile high-level programs to very efficient low-level code),Hardware design languages and hardware verification (creating ways to describe and verify hardware and connect it to verified software to get end-to-end guarantees),Tooling for proof assistants (to support verification efforts, lower entry barriers, and democratize verification technology).My faculty application research summary (pdf) had more info. The following are some concrete recent projects:Formal methods for real-world DSLsElk is a linear-time engine for a subset of JavaScript regular expressions (regexes). Some of the algorithms pioneered in Elk have been merged into V8 (and hence Chrome and Node.js). Warblre is a near-complete Coq translation of the JS regex specification. Developing this spec helped us find mistakes in previous paper-based specifications and disprove longstanding assumptions about JS regexes. Correct-by-construction refinementFiat is a library for the Coq proof assistant that lets users automatically refine declarative specifications into efficient functional programs. Narcissus is an extensible library of context-sensitive parser combinators, general enough to specify and automatically derive verified encoders and decoders for a wide range of binary formats like Ethernet, ARP, TCP, IP, etc. Extensible proof-producing compilers and binary code extractionF2F is a program extraction framework for Coq that uses syntax-driven automation to derive correct-by-construction imperative programs from nondeterministic functional source code. Rupicola is a compiler-construction toolkit that lets users assemble verified domain-specific compilers from reusable translation lemmas, producing high-performance low-level code from unoptimized domain-specific functional models. Hardware design languages: semantics and verificationKÃ´ika is a rule-based hardware design language with cycle-accurate semantics formalized in Coq. It features high-level abstractions inherited from Bluespec, executable semantics proven to refine one-rule-at-a-time execution, and a formally-verified compiler that generates circuits with good performance. Cuttlesim is a fast cycle-accurate simulator for KÃ´ika that beats state-of-the-art RTL simulators by a factor 2 to 5 by leveraging high-level information to minimize redundant work. Cuttlesim generates C++ models that are readable enough to enable hardware debugging and testing using traditional software tools. Tooling for interactive theorem proversAlectryon is a literate-programming system for Coq that produces interactive visualizations of Coq proofs. Alectryon offers a new way to write, communicate, and preserve proofs, combining the flexibility of procedural proof scripts and the intelligibility of declarative proofs.

I did my undergrad at Ãcole Polytechnique, then moved to the US (MIT) for my PhD (all the details are in my CV). My MSc and PhD theses were both on proof-producing compilers.I do a lot of software development. Some of it is still pretty popular on SourceForge, though most of my development activity happens on Github these days. Over time I've launched or contributed to a bunch of FLOSS projects , including plugins and translations for Rockbox (a free audio player firmware), documentation tools for Coq, Lean and Fâ, and Emacs packages for bibliography management, on-the-fly syntax checking, and various research languages (I wrote biblio.el, ESH, company-coq, Fâ-mode, and boogie-friends; I co-maintain Flycheck and Proof-General).For a while, some of my highest-cited writing was from my early-college blog.For a while I was president of Ãcole Polytechnique's Japan student association, which mostly meant organizing movie showings and food tastings. Around that time I also learnt a lot of Chinese, and at some point made some money selling a Chinese-English dictionary for Windows Phone â it even had its own twitter feed.",
