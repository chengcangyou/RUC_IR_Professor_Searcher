Room: 361 I am an Associate Professor at the Computer Science Department, University of Pisa. I received the PhD degree from the University of Pisa, in 2010. My research interests mainly focus on designing and analyzing algorithms and data structures for large datasets with applications in Information Retrieval and Machine Learning. I love algorithms, data structures, low-level code optimizations, and Rust, often all together at the same time.
