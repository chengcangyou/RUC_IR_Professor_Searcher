We focus on the joint design of algorithms, architectures, circuits and systems to enable optimal tradeoffs between power, speed, and quality of result. Accordingly, our work traverses various levels of abstraction from energy-aware algorithm development for signal processing to efficient architecture design and low-power VLSI circuit implementation.
