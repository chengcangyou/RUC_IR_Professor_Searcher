My background is in Programming Languages and Formal Methods. My research is driven by the curiousity to apply language design techniques and formal methods to solve hard problems in computer science. I work at intersection of PL and Distributed Systems, Databases, Security, and Artificial Intelligence. I am an alumnus of Purdue University, West Lafayette, and BITS Pilani, India. I am part of the CUPLV research group and we are almost always on the lookout for motivated students. Research Interests Distributed Systems/Databases: Safety, Liveness, Weak Consistency, Weak Isolation, CRDTs, MRDTs, Local-first Software, and Dataflow Programming. Cryptography and Privacy: Indistinguishability, Symbolic and Computational Secrecy, and Probabilistic Reasoning. Functional Programming: Dependent Types, DSLs, Concurrency, and Program Synthesis.
