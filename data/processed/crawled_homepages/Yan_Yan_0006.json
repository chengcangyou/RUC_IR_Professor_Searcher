Brief Biography I am an Assistant Professor in Machine Learning at School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State University, leading ROMA Lab for research on uncertainty quantification, machine learning, computer vision and their applications to real-world problems. I am the recipient of NSF CAREER Award (2025). I teach 240 students in three classes every year on average and also mentor 52 students in EECS as a faculty mentor every year. Before joining WSU, I was a postdoctoral research associate in Computer Science Department at University of Iowa, working with Professor Tianbao Yang. I received my Ph.D. in 2018 from Centre for Artificial Intelligent (CAI) in Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology (FEIT), University of Technology Sydney, Australia (UTS), under the supervision of Professor Yi Yang. I was very fortunate to spend five years with people in ReLER Lab. In 2013, I received my B.E. from Tianjin University, in Computer Science. Research Interests Conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification Risk-aware robust learning Statistical machine learning Stochastic convex/non-convex optimization for machine learning problems News Two papers were accepted to AAAI 2026. See arXiv at paper#1 and paper#2. Congratulations to Zijian, Xinyu, Xuesong and Yuanjie! Zijian Zhang, an undergraduate senior student at EECS@WSU, will join us as a PhD student, Spring 2026. Grateful to receive NSF CAREER award. One paper accepted by ICCV 2025 One paper accepted by ICML 2025 (arXiv version) Yuanjie Shi will present her research “Reliable Uncertainty Quantification in Machine Learning via Conformal Prediction” at Thirtieth AAAI/SIGAI Doctoral Consortium. Congratulations! Zijian Zhang will present his AI research proposal “Pancreatic Cancer Diagnosis System” at AAAI-25 Undergraduate Consortium. Congratulations! Xuesong Jia will join us in 2025 as a PhD student @ROMA. Served as SPC for the 39th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2025). Serived as PC for NeurIPS-24, ICLR-25 and AISTATS-25. A paper was accepted by NeurIPS-24. A paper was accepted by ICML-24. A paper was accepted by IJCAI-24. AAAI-2024 Tutorial ‘‘Advances in Robust Time-Series ML: From Theory to Practice’’ has been accepted. We presented our paper ‘‘Probabilistically Robust Conformal Prediction’’ on UAI-2023, at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. Served as a session chair on UAI-2023. Really excellent discussion. Served as SPC for The 38th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2024) Selected for AAAI-2023 New Faculty Highlights. Served as PC the 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023) We presented our paper ‘‘Improving Uncertainty Quantification of Deep Classifiers via Neighborhood Conformal Prediction: Novel Algorithm and Theoretical Analysis’’ on AAAI-2023, at Walter E. Washington Convention Center, Washington, DC, USA. Serving as a faculty mentor for Team Mentoring Program (TMP) at WSU. Serving as a faculty mentor for Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) at WSU. ROMA Lab holds weekly seminars in Fall 2023 (Schedule). Research Group ROMA Lab is looking for highly self-motivated Ph.D. students, working on conformal prediction, risk-aware robust learning, statistical machine learning and stochastic convex/non-convex optimization for machine learning problems.
