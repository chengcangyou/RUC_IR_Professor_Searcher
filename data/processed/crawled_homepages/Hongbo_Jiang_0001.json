He is also the director for the trusted systems and networking key laboratory of Hunan Province, the director of Hunan international technical cooperation base of high performance computing and applications. Prior to Hunan University, he was a tenured professor at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science working with Prof. Shudong Jin, Case Western Reserve University. He ever interned at IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, as well as AT&T Labs Research. He was a Hong Kong Scholar Research Fellow at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, working with Prof. John C. S. Lui. Hongbo has been serving in the editorial board of IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks, IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, IEEE Communications Magazine, ACM/Springer Wireless Networks, Wiley Security and Communication Networks, International Journal of Ad Hoc and Sensor Wireless Networks. He has also been guest editors for IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, Springer Mobile Networks and Applications. He is an elected Member of Academia Europaea (MAE), Fellow of IET (The Institution of Engineering and Technology),  Fellow of BCS (The British Computer Society), Fellow of AAIA (The Asia-Pacific Artificial Intelligence Association), Fellow of AIIA (The International Artificial Intelligence Industry Alliance), Senior Member of ACM, Senior Member of IEEE, Distinguished Member of CCF, and Full Member of IFIP TC6 WG6.2. Now his research focuses on computer networking, especially, wireless networks, and mobile computing. Here are some ongoing projects: Mobile and wireless applications. Data science in Internet of Things. Platforms and applications for edge computing. The Academic Genealogy: Hongbo Jiang (Case Western Reserve University, 2008) --> Shudong Jin (Boston University, 2003) --> Azer Bestavros (Harvard University, 1992) --> Thomas Edward Cheatham (Purdue, 1954), one of the \"roots\" of the academic genealogy of applied computer scientists.
