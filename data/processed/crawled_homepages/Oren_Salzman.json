Prior to that I was postdoctoral fellow in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University where I worked at the Search-based Planning Laboratory with Professor Maxim Likhachev. Before that, I was working at the Personal Robotics Lab with Professor Siddhartha Srinivasa. I completed my PhD in the School of Computer Science at Tel Aviv University, under the supervision of Professor Dan Halperin where I worked on algorithmic robot motion planning. I earned my BSc with honors from the Technion and my MSc with honors from Tel Aviv University. Want to join my research team? I am looking for extremely-motivated undergraduate, masters, and Ph.D. students with strong algorithmic background to work on algorithmic problems in robot motion planning. To get a sense of my research focus, read this research statement. You can also check out different projects we offer at the Computational Robotics Lab (CRL). If you are interested, and have the necessary background, please send me an email with your CV and a few sentences describing your academic background. Technion Robotics Seminar I am co-organizing the Technion Robotics Seminar together with Vadim Indelman, Erez Karpas, Aviv Tamar and Amir Degani. This is a campus-wide seminar, aimed at everyone who is interested in robotics. We will meet every other Monday at 12:30 at Taub 337 (CS building) starting October 28'th. Details will be provided in the seminar's webpage.",
