Previously, I have worked as an universitair hoofddocent at the the Department of Information and Computing Sciences at Utrecht University. I have received a diploma in Computer Science from Paderborn University in 2000 and a Ph.D. from University of TÃ¼bingen in 2004. From 2005 to 2007, I have visited Stanford University as a postdoc, and from 2007 to 2013, I have been a senior scientist and junior research group leader at the Max-Planck Institut Informatik and Saarland University. Research Interests: Understanding Deep Learning (inductive bias, optimization, loss landscapes) Applying machine learning in natural science (in particular physics) Geometry and machine learning (in particular symmetry, representations) Membership in editorial boards: Graphical Models Computer Graphics Forum 2014 â 2017 Membership in program comittees: ACM Siggraph 2013, 2014, 2018 Eurographics 2010, 2011, 2012, 2016 Eurographics State-of-the-Art Reports 2017, 2018 Co-Chair Eurographics short papers 2014 International Conference on Computer Vision 2011 3D Computer Vision 2014 Symp. on 3D Imaging, Modeling, Processing, Visualization, and Transmission (3DimPVT) 2011 â 2012 Symposium on 3D Data Processing, Visualization, and Transmission (3DPVT) 2008, 2010 Symposium on Geometry Processing (SGP) 2008, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2017 Shape Modeling International 2011, 2016, â 2018 Symposium on Point-Based Graphics 2006 â 2008 Afrigraph 2007 â 2010",
