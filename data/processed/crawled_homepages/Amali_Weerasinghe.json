Based on sixteen years of teaching experience in the higher-education sector in Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka, I see myself as a facilitator supporting students to actively pursue knowledge. I am a proponent of helping students to think for themselves through scaffolding so that they can become independent learners and problem-solvers. To my teaching philosophy, I bring my research expertise in intelligent learning environments that aim to provide interactive learning environments customised for each individual student.
