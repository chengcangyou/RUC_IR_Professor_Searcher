Please check the opportunities page if you are interested in systems, with any combination of computer architecture, operating systems, distributed systems, security and formal methods.BioLluÃ­s Vilanova (pronounced as âyou-easeâ) is an Associate Professor (Senior Lecturer in the UK system) in the Department of Computing at Imperial College London, where he is co-lead of the Large-Scale Data & Systems (LSDS) group, and co-founder of the Cloud, Data and Exascale Computing Hub at I-X. His work covers computer architecture, operating systems, and security, with a special interest on using co-design across hardware and software layers to break the zero-sum game we typically find between security and performance.Previously, LluÃ­s was a post-doctoral researcher with Yoav Etsion at the Technionâs Electrical Engineering department. He received his PhD degree from the Computer Architecture Department at Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de Catalunya, where he worked under the guidance of Nacho Navarro, while also participating as a researcher at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center.Research interestsMy interests span wide areas of systems research, focusing on efficiency, simplicity, and security:Computer architectureOperating systems and runtimesVirtualizationCo-design of hardware/software interfacesCloud systems and infrastructuresResource management in heterogeneous and parallel systemsSystem designs for security and privacyFormal methods for building secure systemsYou could take a look at my list of publications to get a more precise idea of my research interests.",
