I also dabble in computational social choice. My PhD supervisor at Charles University was Petr Kolman and my postdoc advisors at Technion (Haifa, Israel) were Asaf Levin and Shmuel Onn. I love Jesus Christ, my wife, and my son, and I like to do math, read, and make music (I have an album!)

Christ died for our sins, just as the Scriptures said. He was buried, and he was raised from the dead on the third day, just as the Scriptures said. He was seen by Peter and then by the Twelve. After that, he was seen by more than 500 of his followers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have died. Then he was seen by James and later by all the apostles. Last of all, as though I had been born at the wrong time, I also saw him. Paul of Tarsus, The First Epistle to the Corinthians, likely written no more than five years after Jesus' death (one of the oldest New Testament fragments). I believe this.
