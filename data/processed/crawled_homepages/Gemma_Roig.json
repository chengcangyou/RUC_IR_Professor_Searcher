Gülden BispinckAdmin support bispinck@em.uni-frankfurt.de I am a postdoctoral fellow working with Dr. Gemma Roig at the Goethe University Frankfurt and Dr. Radoslaw Cichy at the Freie-Universität Berlin, funded by a FIAS scholarship. Previously I completed a dual Ph.D. in cognitive neuroscience and computer science at Michigan State University. Before that, I studied math and worked in VLSI at Apple. Currently, my main interest is understanding emerging representations in artificial and human neurons. Sari Saba-Sadiya Postdoc fellow [personal website] I am a postdoctoral fellow working with Dr. Gemma Roig. Previously I completed my PhD at CerCo-CNRS UMR 5549, Toulouse. I am interested in understanding networks using a special pair of glasses: one which has a machine learning lens on one and neuroscience on the other. Specifically, I am interested in building networks that are more biological and in turn using them and their properties to get a peek into the human brain. Bhavin Choksi Postdoc fellow I'm a PhD student at Goethe University Frankfurt working with Prof. Gemma Roig and Prof. Visvanathan Ramesh.

My special interest is in making connections between human and machine learning systems. Gamze Akyol PhD student I am a PhD student at Goethe University Frankfurt, supervised by Prof. Roig andsupported by Prof. Zicari. I did my Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science at KIT in Karlsruhe, Germany, and worked as a Machine Learning Engineer in the Netherlands. My work is focused on the application of AI systems: how can we trust them to make fair and ethical decisions? Dennis Vetter PhD student I am a Phd student at the neurodynamics of visual cognition lab, Freie-Universität Berlin, where I am advised by Prof. Radoslaw Martin Cichy. During my PhD, I will also work with Prof. Gemma Roig's group and focus on self-supervised models to predict and explain brain data. I completed my master degree in electronic engineering in the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in June 2019. My master project is mainly about utilizing digital image processing and machine learning methods to realize nondestructive analysis of materials. From October 2019 to June 2020, I used to work as an intern in General Electrical (GE China) company, using Python to do medical image processing. In June 2016 I graduated from the Sun-Yat-Sen University in China with my bachelor degree in optics. Manshan Guo PhD student I’m a PhD student working in the field of cognitive computational neuroscience, supervised by Prof. Gemma Roig. I’m both part of the CVAI lab at Goethe University and the Ernst Strüngmann Institute for Neuroscience (in Cooperation with Max Planck Society) in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. My current research focuses on understanding how humans and machines abstract semantic knowledge when presented with multimodal sources of information. Martina Vilas PhD student[personal website] I’m a PhD student at Goethe University Frankfurt working with Prof. Gemma Roig. I did my Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science at Information Technology University Lahore (ITU). I have received a doctoral scholarship from the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) to pursue my research in Germany. I’m interested in applying computer vision techniques to build novel zero-shot models for semantic segmentation, scene understanding, pose estimation, motion feature extraction and analysis for emotion classification from video. Muhammad Ahsan PhD student I am a Ph.D. student at Goethe University Frankfurt under the supervision of Professor Gemma Roig. Both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees were completed at Goethe University, specializing in Computer Science. I am part of the ARENA project, which focuses on studying the development of abstract representations in multimodal models. To achieve my research objectives, I collaborate with psychology and cognitive neuroscience researchers. Furthermore, I am interested in multimodal self-supervised and zero-shot learning techniques, as well as the creation of efficient systems and  mechanistic interpretability. Timothy Schaumlöffel PhD student I am a PhD student at Goethe University Frankfurt, co-supervised by Prof. Gemma Roig and Prof. Visvanathan Ramesh. I did my Bachelor's and Masters in Computer Science at Istanbul Technical University (ITU), Turkey. During my Bachelor's and Master's, I worked on face biometrics and anomaly detection. My current work focuses on explainable and transparent AI systems for education. I am also interested in representation and metric learning. Alperen Kantarcı PhD student I’m a Ph.D. student working on the intersection of simulations and deep learning at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies supervised by Dr. Roberto Covino and Prof. Gemma Roig. I am a recipient of a doctoral scholarship from the Polytechnische Gesellschaft. I am currently researching making molecular dynamics simulations faster and more steerable using deep-learning generative models. I also develop deep learning methods for the visual arts as a hobby. Magnus Petersen PhD student[personal website] [twitter] I am a PhD student at the lab of Prof. Dr. Gemma Roig, focusing on exploring the connection between the human brain and its cortical functions through the lens of deep neural networks. My primary research aim is to understand why specific deep neural networks can predict processes in the human brain despite their biological implausibility, delving into the realms of interpretable AI and neuroscience.I am also one of the developers of the toolbox Net2Brain, which is a valuable tool for exploring the relationship between artificial neural networks and brain activity. Domenic Bersch PhD student I am a PhD student at Goethe University Frankfurt working with Prof. Gemma Roig and Prof. Yee Lee Shing as part of the LEECHI project. My research lies at the intersection of developmental psychology and machine learning, with a focus on bridging traditional survey-based assessment methods and modern computational approaches.

My broader interests include zero-shot learning and the efficient characterization of large, unstructured behavioral datasets. Bastian Rothenburger PhD Student I am a PhD candidate at the University of Amsterdam (VISLab, Informatics Institute) supervised by Iris Groen and Cees Snoek, as well as Gemma Roig at Goethe University through the European AI Laboratory ELLIS. I hold an Integrated Masters degree (BSc & MSc) in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens. My research focuses on the representational alignment between deep video-AI and the human brain and behaviour. Through assessing the extent of alignment in current state-of-the-art models and researching methods to explicitly increase alignment, I aim to work towards the goal of enhancing the models’ robustness and generalisability.
