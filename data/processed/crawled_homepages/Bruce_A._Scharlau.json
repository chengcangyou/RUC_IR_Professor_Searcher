Your people will thank you later. I engineer 'learn by doing' experiences for people with lean, agile, & service design. I'm especially interested in teaching students and other teams how to collaborate more effectively. I also coach individuals, & facilitate co-creative events. This experience led me to write my latest book: 'Teaching Team Collaboration: the Human-Side of Software Development' so that I can help others learn from my experience. See link further below. This is also supported by more regular writing on the accompanying website and mail list at https://simplybegin.co.uk I was a senior lecturer in the Computer Science at the University of Aberdeen from 2001 to 2024, where I taught students how to use agile, lean and service design approaches in their software development processes. Using these three approaches they can learn to co-create solutions with validated learning by bringing real people into the development process to clarify assumptions about their ideas. This blending of agile, lean startup and service design aspects in the software development work has proven popular and made for better applications. I'm now writing and helping a startup, while also being a trustee at Code the City, which focuses on using open data in civic apps for good. Update",
