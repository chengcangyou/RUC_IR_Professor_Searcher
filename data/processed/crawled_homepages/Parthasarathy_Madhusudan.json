See Whitepaper. Current research projects and philosophy My general research philosophy is to turn the theory lens (mainly logic, learning, algorithms) towards practical computing domains. For the most part, I shy away from working on problems purely motivated by theoretical concerns as well as those entirely based on heuristics to solve practical problems. My current research interests are primarily in automating software verification and building correct-by-design systems, trustworthy and safe systems that use AI/ML components, and exploring synergies between machine learning and program synthesis for building intelligent systems. Note to prospective students I am actively looking for Ph.D. students in the following areas. If you are interested, please apply for the Ph.D. program and write to me personally. Trustworthy AI systems: proving safety of systems with ML components, especially vision; see paper on Perception Contracts in OOPSLA'23 Predictable Verification, applied to concurrent programs, distributed programs; see paper on Predictable Verification using Intrinsic Data Structures at PLDI'24 Science and practice of building verified distributed systems with significant automation, like blockchains, bitcoin, and smart contracts (see FMCAD 2019). In particular, I am interested in theory and practice of refining abstract models to concrete distributed models. Using LLMs to support writing formal specifications and proving theorems. Program Synthesis from natural language specifications Learning logics: Theoretical and practical algorithms for learning logical concepts from data (see IJCAI'22, POPL'22, OOPSLA'22, OOPSLA'23). Logics and reasoning for program verification: especially logics involving expressive specifications for programs manipulating quantified specifications and datastructures. See papers on natural proofs in POPL 2012, PLDI 2013, PLDI 2014, and POPL 2018, work on Frame Logic (ESOP'20), and work on inductive lemma synthesis (OOPSLA'22).
