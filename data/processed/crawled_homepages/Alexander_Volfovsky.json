  "content": "Alexander Volfovsky I am an associate professor of statistical science and computer science at Duke University. I work primarily on fundamental properties of different statistical concepts with broad inetrests in network analysis, causal inference and computational constraints of statistical methods. I am the Co-Director two labs at Duke: (1) The Polarization Lab at Duke brings together scholars from the social sciences, statistics, and computer science to develop new technology to bridge America’s partisan divide. (2) The Almost Matching Exactly Lab at Duke brings together statisticians, computer scientists, economists and political scientists to develop tools for interpretable causal inference. I am the past president of the New Researchers Group at the Institute of Mathematical Statistics which coordinates the Meeting of New Researchers in Statistics and Probability (supported by the National Science Foundation). If interested in joining our group to work on exciting problems in statistical methodology for political polarization, network analysis and large scale causal inference, please reach out via email with your CV. Travel is a bit on hiatus. Should resume in September-ish 2023. Our work is graciously supported by NIH, NSF, ARI, Facebook, Google, the Templeton Foundation and Duke University.",
