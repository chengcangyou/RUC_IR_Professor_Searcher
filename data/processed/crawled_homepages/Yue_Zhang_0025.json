Join us to explore innovative solutions and advance the field of cybersecurity! Please feel free to reach out via email at zyueinfosec@sdu.edu.cn or zyueinfosec@gmail.com. Bio:I am currently a professor of School of Computer Science and Technology at Shandong University, working with Professor Xiuzhen Cheng. Before joining Shandong University, I was a tenure-track assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at Drexel University (2024 - 2025). I spent three years as a postdoc researcher at The Ohio State University (OSU) (2020 - 2023), working with Prof. Zhiqiang Lin. Before coming to OSU, I graduated from Jinan University (2016 - 2020), under the supervision of Jian Weng and Weiqi Luo. Also, I ever visited/worked at University of Central Florida (UCF) / University of Massachusetts Lowell (UML) (2018 -2020), under the supervision of Xinwen Fu.You can also visit my Chinese page (中文页面).News:✯ [2025/10] - I will serve as a TPC Member for WWW 2026 and Euro S&P 2026 - 𝕟𝕖𝕨 ! ✯ [2025/09] - One paper accepted by ASE 2025 - 𝕟𝕖𝕨 ! ✯ [2025/09] - One paper accepted by IEEE S&P 2026 - 𝕟𝕖𝕨 ! ✯ [2025/09] - I will serve as a guest editor for IET Communications - 𝕟𝕖𝕨 ! ✯ [2025/08] - One paper accepted by CCS 2025 - 𝕟𝕖𝕨 ! ✯ [2025/08] - I I’m excited to share that I was recognized as an USENIX Security Notable Reviewer 2025 and one paper awarded as USENIX Security 2025 Distinguished Paper Honorable Mention - 𝕟𝕖𝕨 ! ✯ [2025/08] - I will serve as a guest editor for Security, Privacy, Safety, and Regulation of AIGC - 𝕟𝕖𝕨 ! ✯ [2025/08] - One paper accepted by NDSS 2026 - 𝕟𝕖𝕨 ! ✯ [2025/07] - I will serve as a TPC Member for ACM Inscrypt 2025 and IEEE MASS SLICE 2025! - 𝕟𝕖𝕨 ! ✯ [2025/07] - I will serve as a TPC Member (Network Security Track) for ACM CCS 2026 and GE for IC Securing the Internet of Things! - 𝕟𝕖𝕨 ! ✯ [2025/06] - I serve as a TPC member for SatS 2025 and as the Publicity Chair for the IEEE MASS DLS Workshop 2025. - 𝕟𝕖𝕨 ! ✯ [2025/05] - Two papers accepted by ACL 2025 and one paper accepted by TOPS - 𝕟𝕖𝕨 ! ✯ [2025/05] - I will serve as a TPC Member for USENIX Security 2026 - 𝕟𝕖𝕨 ! ✯ [2025/04] - I will serve as a TPC Member for ACSAC 2025 and NDSS 2026 - 𝕟𝕖𝕨 ! ✯ [2025/03] - One paper accepted by IEEE S&P 2025 - 𝕟𝕖𝕨 ! ✯ [2025/03] - I joined Shandong University as a Full Professor ✯ [2025/02] - I was recognized as an NDSS Distinguished Reviewer 2025 ✯ [2025/01] - Two papers accepted by USENIX Security 2025 ✯ [2024/12] - One paper accepted by USENIX Security 2025Recent Research Interests:LLM for Security: [IEEE S&P 25],[EAAI 24],[EMNLP 24], [NDSS 26], [ASE 25] LLM Security and Applications: [USENIX Security 25c],[IoT-J25],[CCS 23a],[ACL 25a], [ACL 25b] Mobile Security: [USENIX Security 25b],[NDSS 25b],[CCS 23a],[CCS 23b],[NDSS 23c],[USENIX Security 23],[ICSE 23],[CCS 22b] IoT Security: [USENIX Security 25a],[NDSS 25a],[CCS 24a],[CCS 24c],[NDSS 23b],[CCS 24b], [USENIX Security 24],[NDSS 23a],[CCS 22a],[NDSS 2026],[IEEE S&P 26] Program Analysis: [CCS 24b],[USENIX Security 23],[ICSE 23],[NDSS 23a],[USENIX Security 25b],[NDSS 25b],[CCS 23a],[CCS 23b],[NDSS 23c],[CCS 22b]Selected Publications (Complete List):I have published more than 60 papers.
