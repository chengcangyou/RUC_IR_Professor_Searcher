Ryan Williams Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science MIT CSAIL and EECS 32 Vassar St, Cambridge, MA 02139 Email: rr + my last name at gmail.com I was a professor at Stanford from 2011-2016. I got a PhD from Carnegie Mellon under the marvelous Manuel Blum, and I was an undergrad at Cornell. For more, see my CV below.

I work in algorithm design and complexity theory, and I especially like connections between the two subjects. I think about many questions, but a few of them haunt me more than others. Some examples: Can the existence of an algorithm for a problem be used to prove that other algorithms cannot exist for other problems? Can the nonexistence of algorithms be used to prove that another algorithm correctly solves a problem? (In fact, there are \"yes\" answers to both questions!) Does every function implementable with a low memory footprint also have a fast implementation? (Is $P = PSPACE$?) Could computers themselves help us make progress on answering these questions?

Further south in Alabama there is a good school for math and science.",
