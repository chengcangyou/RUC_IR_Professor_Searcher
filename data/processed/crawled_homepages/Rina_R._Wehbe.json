Wehbe – #HCI4Good Skip to content About Dr Rina R. Wehbe (she/her) Ph.D., M.Sc., B.Sc. is an academic researcher and as of July 1st, is an Assistant Professor in the Faculty of Computer Science (FCS), Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. She accepted the offer to join FCS following the successful defence of her Ph.D. dissertation in Computer Science from the Cheriton School of Computer Science, Faculty of Mathematics, University of Waterloo. Her work explores the boundaries of collaboration over large interactive displays in playful and serious settings and resulting directions for persuasive design. I am now starting my own research group HCI4Good and I am looking for graduate students.Apply on LINKEDIN.COM Wehbe’s research is driven by the desire to drive social change for the good of all humans. Research directions include the education of individuals, promotion of equitable thought, and persuasive methods. I am interested in augmenting public space using technology to promote community education and collaboration. I also am interested in research on usable privacy; animal-computer interaction; equity and inclusion in STEM; and more. Her additional research interests include Games4Change, learning and education, affective computing, user difficulty, and expert users. She applies her work to both the domains of games, interface design, and productivity applications. Her unique interdisciplinary background B.Sc. Psychology and M.Sc. Computer Science informs her work. I am open to research project proposals from students, industry (companies, startups, incubators), organizers of public spaces (maker spaces, libraries, galleries, museums, etc) and academic collaborations worldwide.
