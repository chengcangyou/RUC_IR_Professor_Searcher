I did my PhD in Italy under the supervision of Prof. Johann Gamper (Libera Università di Bolzano) and then went to the UK for postdoctoral research under Prof. Graham Cormode (University of Warwick) & Dr. Grigorios Loukides (King's College London) followed by working as a Lecturer in Computer Science (Queen Mary & Westfield College, University of London). Research My research focuses primarily on algorithms, data structures and summaries to manage very large or sensitive data. The overall goal is to build a full data pipeline that feeds end users with easily interpretable facts which provide novel insights and aid decision making processes. Reducing the data complexity either through sampling or summarisation plays a crucial role to support exploratory interactions with the data that involve a lot of probing, while still providing an intuitive approximation model of the data. Sensitive data calls for privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy & federated learning to facilitate data sharing between organisations whilst minimising risks to the privacy of patients, users, customers and employees whose personal information is collected.

I am still learning more about the intricacies involved and potential stumbling blocks ahead, but let me know if you are in any way interested in making it easier to make dedicated donations towards accommodation for people sleeping rough.
