The lab is led by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Sebastian Schelter and is part of the Berlin Institute for the Foundations of Learning and Data (BIFOLD). Our lab conducts fundamental research at the intersection of data engineering and machine learning, which addresses data-related problems in AI-driven applications that cause negative economic, societal or scientific impact. Our goal is to foster the responsible and resilient management of data and to lower the technical bar for working with data and AI. Our research is accompanied by efficient and scalable open source implementations, many of which are applied in real world use cases, for example in the Amazon Web Services cloud and in large European e-commerce platforms. The focus areas of the lab are: Data-centric debugging of machine learning pipelines and systems Data processing in compliance with legal regulations, such as the “right-to-be-forgotten” Automated validation of data at scale Our research contributions have been recognized with an ACM SIGMOD Systems Award, an ACM SIGMOD Best Demo Runner Up Award and a Best Paper Runner Up Award from the Table Representation Learning workshop at NeurIPS. Furthermore, we received awards from industry such as an Amazon Education Research Grant Award and the Olympus Mons Pioneer Award. We have ongoing collaborations with researchers from the University of Amsterdam and CWI in the Netherlands, and New York University and Harvard in the US. News Previous News Sep 26, 2025 ‐ Barrie and Pierre are at RecSys in Prague this week! Barrie presents our work on on Scalable Data Debugging for Neighborhood-based Recommendation with Data Shapley Values, which was selected as a spotlight oral. Pierre gives a talk on his initial ideas Towards a Real-World Aligned Benchmark for Unlearning in Recommender Systems at the Responsible recommendation workshop. Jul 15, 2025 ‐ Meet Olga from our lab at ICML in Vancouver this week! She will present a research paper on scSSL-Bench: Benchmarking Self-Supervised Learning for Single-Cell Data, which was selected as a spotlight poster, as well as a second paper on Towards Cross-Modal Error Detection with Tables and Images at the DataWorld workshop. Jul 14, 2025 ‐ Our external PhD student Zeyu from the University of Amsterdam is starting his internship with the Amazon Q team of AWS Berlin this week! Jul 7, 2025 ‐ Our external PhD Student Barrie Kersbergen (co-supervised with Maarten de Rijke) has successfully defended his PhD at the University of Amsterdam! Barrie’s research on recommender systems has been deployed to millions of users at the European e-commerce platform bol.com. Jun 10, 2025 ‐ Meet our lab at the SIGMOD conference in Berlin next week! We are part of the organizing committee of the conference and co-organise the DEEM workshop as well. Furthermore, we will present a workshop paper on Towards Automated Task-Aware Data Validation and run a tutorial on Navigating Data Errors in Machine Learning Pipelines on Friday.
