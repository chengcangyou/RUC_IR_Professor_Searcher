From 2009 to 2015, I received my MS and PhD degrees in Electrical Engineering from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), under the direction of Raytheon Chair Professor Kang L. Wang (IEEE Fellow). After finishing the post-doctoral training at UCLA (2015-2016), I joined ShanghaiTech University as a tenure-track assistant professor in the School of Information Science and Technology (SIST) in 2016. Since 2021, I have been promoted as the tenured associate professor and the assistant dean of SIST. My main research areas include spintronics and cryogenic electronics. So far, I have published 3 book chapters, and co-authored 80+ peer-reviewed papers including Nature Electronics, Nature Materials, Nature Nanotechnology, Nature Communications, Science Advances, Physical Review Letters, Advanced Materials, Nano Letters, Proceedings of the IEEE, IEEE-IEDM, and IEEE-EDL with more than 6600 citations (h-index of 35).
