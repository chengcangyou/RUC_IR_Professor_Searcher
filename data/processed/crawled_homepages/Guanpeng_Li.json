Broadly speaking, my research focuses on building dependable high-performance computer systems. In the past, my students and/or I have won the Best Paper Awards (or finalists) at SC, DSN, and ISSRE conferences in 2024, 2022, 2021, 2020 and 2018, and IEEE Top Picks in Test and Reliability in 2023 and 2024. I am also the recipient of NSF CAREER Award and IEEE Computer Society TCHPC Early Career Researchers Award for Excellence in High-Performance Computing (2024).
