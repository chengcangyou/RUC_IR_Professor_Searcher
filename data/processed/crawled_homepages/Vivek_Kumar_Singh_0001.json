I have a Text Analytics research group which focuses on these tasks. See www.textanalytics.in for details. Scientometrics My interest in Scientometrics is on analysis of scholarly databases, computational analysis of bibliometric data for mapping research competence of institutions/ countries, international research collaboration, identifying thematic research trends in different disciplines, altmetric studies, mining scientific publications, etc. I have special interest in analysis of STI data for India. My research group has designed a Research Mapping system for India, though a bit old data but still an interesting visit, available at: Indian Science Reports (www.indianscience.net). Artificial and Collective Intelligence My interest in Artificial & Collective Intelligence is aimed at analyzing the structural and dynamic properties of collective systems exhibiting intelligent behaviours. I have designed agent-based simulations to model complex social processes and structures and used them to understand & analyze the dynamics of collective intelligence in social groups and organizations. 1.
