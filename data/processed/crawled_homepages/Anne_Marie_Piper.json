My research in human-computer interaction and accessible computing aims to create more equitable and inclusive digital experiences for people of all ages and abilities. My prior and ongoing work focuses on designing new technologies for collaborative work among ability-diverse teams of professionals and academics; developing accessible content production tools for artists, writers, and musicians who are blind; and leveraging the arts as a form of expression and resource for designing alongside people with dementia or speech-language impairments. My research and teaching has been recognized with an NSF CAREER Award, Alumnae of Northwestern Award for Curriculum Development, Best Paper Awards and Nominations at ACM CHI, CSCW, DIS, and ASSETS, and a UC-San Diego Interdisciplinary Scholar Award. I received my PhD in Cognitive Science from the University of California, San Diego, MA in Education from Stanford University, and BS in Computer Science from Georgia Tech. Prior to joining UC-Irvine, I was a tenured faculty member in Communication Studies at Northwestern University. Affiliations UCI Department of Informatics, Professor UCI Accessibility Research Collective, founding member UCI Steckler Center for Responsible, Ethical, and Accessible Technology (CREATE), Associate Director UCI Master's in Human-Computer Interaction and Design (MHCID), Faculty Director Research Highlights A core area of my research involves studying, designing, and building new digital tools for accessible work and content production. With colleagues at UCI and Northwestern, we received a $2M NSF Future of Work Award to study work practices and tools for blind and low vision information workers. We also received a $1.2M NSF Medium Award to study and design the future of content production tools for blind and low vision people. I have written extensively on understanding technology and online life among older adults, including issues of ageism in technology design and what it means to age online in the context of disability. Much of this work was supported by an NSF CAREER Award and EAGER Award. My work also understands participatory design methods involving people with complex communication needs (e.g., dementia, aphasia, trauma) and how co-design can be made more equiable and just. A previous NSF-funded project explored the design and evaluation of surface haptics for young children's science learning. See our project website for more details.
