Ian's research interests are in formal methods for software development. Errors in a compiler for a programming language can generate errors in the myriad of programs they compile. Our research is looking at verifying optimisation phases of a compiler. Concurrent programs are difficult to reason about due to the interleaving of execution of concurrent threads leading to an explosion of possible execution sequences. Our research is developing techniques for rely/guarantee reasoning about concurrent programs. Both the above research strands make use of the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover.
