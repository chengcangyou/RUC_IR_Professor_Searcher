If you are interested, read this before contacting me. Hi, welcome to my page. I am an associate professor in the Computer Science Department at UT Dallas. My research interests lie broadly in Computer Science Theory, but primarily I work on problems in Computational Geometry and Geometric Approximation Algorithms. Current Students: Md. Billal Hossain (PhD) Jonathan James Perry (PhD) Graduated: Chenglin Fan (PhD) Hongyao Huang (PhD) Georgiy Klimenko (PhD) Gregory Van Buskirk (PhD) Teaching: Computational Geometry: CS 6319 (Spring 2025) Funding: NSF AF: Shape Matching in a Messy World Using FrÃ©chet Distance NSF CAREER: Giving Form to Data with a Geometric Scafold NSF CRII: Breaking Barriers for Geometric Data (Completed) My PhD advisor was Sariel Har-Peled. Here is a copy of my CV, and here is a sneezing bear. My research on other sites: arXiv dblp Google Scholar Published Papers: The paper links below are not updated regularly.
