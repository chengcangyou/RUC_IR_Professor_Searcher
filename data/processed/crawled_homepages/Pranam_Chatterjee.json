To accomplish this goal, we train language models, such as SaLT&PepPr, PepPrCLIP, and PepMLM, to de novo design peptide binders to any pathogenic protein without needing its structure, and subsequently link these binders to post-translational modification domains to edit the protein. Our current peptide-E3 ubiquitin ligase (uAbs) and peptide-deubiquitinase fusions (duAbs) represent a CRISPR-like approach for targeted protein degradation and stabilization. We are now extending this to multi-objective-guided generation of therapeutic peptides with PepTune and MOG-DFM, as well as specific targeting of dysregulated isoforms with PTM-Mamba, FusOn-pLM, and moPPIt! Home: Our TeamOur TeamWe program biology to do what we want.Pranam ChatterjeeAssistant Professor of Bioengineering Assistant Professor of Computer and Information Science University of Pennsylvania MIT (SB '16, SM '18, PhD '20) Co-Founder of Gameto, Inc.
