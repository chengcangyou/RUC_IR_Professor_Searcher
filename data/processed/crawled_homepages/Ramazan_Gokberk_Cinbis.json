Professor METU ImageLab - Computer Vision and Machine Learning Research Lab Department of Computer Engineering Middle East Technical University (METU) Bio: I was a doctoral researcher in the LEAR (now THOTH) team, at INRIA Grenoble, France, from 2010 until 2014, where my advisors were Jakob Verbeek and Cordelia Schmid, and received a PhD degree from Université de Grenoble. I received an M.A. degree from Boston University, USA, in 2010, where my advisor was Stan Sclaroff. My research interests include data-efficient machine learning with minimal supervision (zero-shot, few-shot, weakly-supervised, self-supervised learning), generative models, learning to learn (meta learning), vision-language integration, and large-scale image/video understanding.
