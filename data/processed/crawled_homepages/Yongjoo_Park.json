I also study a few core database topics. Kishu: Managing Exploratory AI Kishu achieves World’s First Undoable Jupyter with reliable/efficient checkpointing 🎤 Non-academic Presentations: [PyConUS’25] [JupyterCon’25] ✏️ Academic Publications: [DEEM’23] [VLDB’24] [SIGMOD’24 demo] [VLDB’25] [CHI’25] [CHI’25 short] [SIGMOD’25 demo] 🚀 Kishu is now open-sourced on GitHub Kishuboard: offers Git-like versioning in the code+data space. CARE: Efficient Reasoning with (Un)structured Data The CARE (CAusal-RElational data system) project develops a scalable system for reasoning with structured and unstructured data with end-to-end optimization: Analytics and LLM Inference: [VLDB'26] [ICDE'26] Vector Database: [VLDB'25] In-Storage Computing: [ISCA'25] [ISPASS'25] Core database topics AirDB aims to allow transactions directly on storage layer (without servers). AirIndex optimizes the structures of indexes automatically, considering system performance like latency, bandwidth, etc. [SIGMOD’24] DeepOLA aims to offer progressive analytics (or Online Aggregation) to continuous data exploration frequently observed with Pandas-like libraries. [SIGMOD’23] These are amazing students I am working with.

Prospective PhD Students: Every year, I recruit one or two new PhD students. If you are interested in working with me, please indicate in your application or send me an email (to my Illinois address). These are some helpful articles I wrote: TOEFL score requirements for CS@UIUC Information about Illinois’ PhD admission process (2020) UIUC Undergrads: Every semester, I plan to advise a few students (and more during summer). If you are interested, please send me an email. Prospective Master’s Students: In general, I prioritize supporting PhD students. However, I may support a few exceptional MS students with RA. (Almost all) MS students are supported with TA by the department.",
