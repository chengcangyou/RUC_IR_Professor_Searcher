We employ computational methods to elucidate intertwined relationships between protein/gene sequences, structure, function, interactions, genome, and pathways. The ultimate goal of our research projects is to obtain new, comprehensive understanding of how structures and functions are coded in molecular sequences and how functions of molecules are orchestrated in a cell. Previous Next Specifically, we develop and apply novel computational methods forâ¦ Predicting protein structure from sequence Predicting protein function from sequence and structure Predicting protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions Predicting functional sites in sequences Genome-scale function and structure annotation Analyzing functional units in networks More information can be found on our research projects page here For information on lab openings, see here Tweets by kiharalab Visit @kiharalab on Twitter Â© 2021 Kihara Lab.
