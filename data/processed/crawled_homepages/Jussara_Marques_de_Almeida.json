AntÃ´nio Carlos, 6627 Contact Short Bio Jussara M. Almeida holds a PhD and an MSc degrees in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA (2003 and 1999, respectively), as well as a Master and Bachelor degrees also in Computer Science by the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG), Brazil (1997 and 1994, respectively). She is currently an Associate Professor in the Computer Science Department at UFMG as well as Affiliated Member of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences (2011-2015). Her research is focused around understanding how users interact with different applications, characterizing and modeling the workload patterns that emerge from such interactions, and exploiting those patterns to enhance current applications and services on the Web. She is particularly interested in characterizing and modeling user behavior in online social networks, and social computing in general. Research Interests Workload characterization and modeling. Performance modeling and analysis. Social computing and recommendation systems. Graduate Students I am glad to work with a very talented group of graduate students on various exciting topics including modeling and prediction of various types of online content popularity, characterization and modeling of cloud storage systems, design of novel recommendation systems taking relevance, novelty and diversity aspects into account, urban mobility modeling, and modeling community dynamics. They are: Marisa Vasconcelos (PhD) Flavio Figueiredo (PhD) Fabiano Belém (PhD) Glauber GonÃ§alves (PhD) Alexandre Magno de Sousa (PhD) Lucas Maia Silveira (MSc) Anna Christina GuimarÃ£es (MSc) Ruhan Bidart (MSc) Michelle Hanne (MSc) If you are a graduate or undergraduate student, searching for academic orientation on some of the topics I am interested in, let's talk!
