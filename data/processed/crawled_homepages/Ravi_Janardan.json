Research Geometric Computing and Applications Broadly speaking, geometric computing is concerned with the design of efficient computational techniques for representing, reasoning with, and manipulating geometric entities. My research here encompasses algorithm and data structure design and analysis, software development, and deployment of solutions into applications. Application areas of current interest include computer-aided design and manufacture, biomedical simulation and modeling, geometric computing under uncertainty, and spatial query processing. To get a flavor for some of this, you can check out some of my work on layered manufacturing (a.k.a. 3D-printing) here. Feel free to email me (lastname@umn.edu) if you would like more information or copies of my other papers, or are interested in collaborating on research. Teaching In Fall 2025, I am teaching a course on advanced algorithms and data structures (CSci 5421). In Spring 2026, I am teaching an honors course on discrete structures (CSci 2011H).
