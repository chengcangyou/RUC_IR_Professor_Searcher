I work part-time as a staff research scientist at Google DeepMind. Our research focuses on multimodal concept learning and reasoning, as well as controllable, principled, and scalable image and video generation, and their applications in robotic planning and control. A long-standing research tradition of the lab is video understanding. Previously, I received my Ph.D. from the University of Southern California in 2016, advised by Prof. Ram Nevatia. I completed my bachelor degree in Computer Science at Tsinghua University in 2011. I have received Brown University's Richard B. Salomon Faculty Research Award and Samsung's Global Research Outreach Award for multimodal concept learning from videos. My research on behavior prediction appeared in the CVPR 2019 best paper finalist. Our lab's research has been supported by Adobe, Honda, Meta, NASA, and Samsung. Our lab is a member of the NSF AI Research Institute on Interaction for AI Assistants. My office hours are 3:30 to 5:00 pm ET on Tuesdays at CIT 379. Teaching CSCI 2470, Deep Learning, Fall. CSCI 2952-N, Advanced Topics in Deep Learning, Spring. Short course on Multimodal Transformers, ICASSP 2022 and AAAI 2023.
