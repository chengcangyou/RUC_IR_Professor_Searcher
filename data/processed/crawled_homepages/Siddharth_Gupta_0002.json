Before moving to Goa, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Computer Science at University of Warwick, UK advised by Professor Ramanujan Sridharan. Before that, I was a Zuckerman Postdoctoral Scholar at the Department of Computer Science at Ben-Gurion University, Israel advised by Professor Meirav Zehavi. I received my PhD in Computer Science from University of California, Irvine, USA in 2018, advised by Professor David Eppstein and Professor Michael T. Goodrich, and my Master in Mathematics and Bachelor in Computer Science from BITS Pilani, K K Birla Goa Campus, India in 2014, advised by Professor Ankit Agrawal and Professor Tarkeshwar Singh. Research Interests My research interests lie in Graph Algorithms and Computational Geometry, more specifically in Graph Drawing, Parameterized Complexity, Approximation Algorithms, Fine-Grained Complexity and Combinatorial Reconfiguration.
