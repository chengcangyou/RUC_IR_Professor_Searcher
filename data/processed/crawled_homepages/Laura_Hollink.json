Examples of recent research include: measuring bias and diversity in recommender systems; examining biased (colonial) terminology in knowledge graphs; and discovering usage patterns in a digital library. I am leading the Human-Centered Data Analytics group at CWI. I am also co-director of the Cultural AI Lab and participant in the AI, Media and Democracy Lab. These are interdisciplinary labs where AI researchers collaborate with social scientists, humanities scholars and professionals from the culture and media sectors. I strive to work on real data and real use cases, and these labs make that possible. My background is in Knowledge Representation and Human-Computer Interaction. I have worked on linking heterogeneous and often cross-media collections, data modelling, and semantic search. See for example the Talk of Europe project about creating Linked Open Data about the meetings of the European Parliament. I was co-organizer of the USEWOD workshop series, which ran from 2011 to 2016, about query logs in Linked Open Data, in which we released a research dataset of usage logs of several Linked Data servers, including DBPedia and Bioportal. I obtained a PhD in Computer Science from VU University Amsterdam in 2006 with a thesis titled \"Semantic Annotation for Retrieval of Visual Resources.\" Projects Talk of Europe View presentation on SlideShare: Talk of Europe at CLICKNL Connected Data In Talk of Europe (ToE) we translate the proceedings of the meetings of the European Parliament (europarl) to Linked Data. Our aim is to support a quantitative, longitudinal analysis of the EU parliamentary debates. ToE is a collaboration between VU University Amsterdam, the Erasmus University Rotterdam, DANS and the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision, and is a follow-up of the PoliMedia project in which these partners collaborated previously. It is funded by CLARIN ERIC and CLARIN-NL, made possible with support from NWO and OCW. You can query our data from a SPARQL endpoint. 01/2016: The Talk of Europe movie is finished! PoliMedia View presentation on Slideshare: Connecting political data to media data How do different media-outlets cover political news? The PoliMedia project aims to showcase the potential of cross-media analysis for research in the humanities, by curating automatically detected semantic links between data sets of different media types. See also the promotional movie that was made about PoliMedia. 09/2013: Polimedia won the LinkedUp Veni Competition! Try our demo at Polimedia.nl or read our paper. 04/2014: Polimedia featured in an article by Ewoud Sanders in the Dutch newspaper NRC about searching through public digital collections. 06/2015: PoliMedia won the Open Data prize at the LODLAM challenge! LODLAM was co-located with the Digital Humanities Conference 2015. VRE4EIC VRE4IEC is a EU H2020 project that aspires a Europe-wide interoperable Virtual Research Environment. I lead workpackage 5 on policies for privacy, security and trust within a VRE. ION The project Images and Text in Online News (ION) is funded from two Amsterdam Data Science student assistant grants in 2015 and 2016. Our aim is to support a large scale analysis of images used in online news. For this purpose, we have constructed and made available the ION corpus, which is the basis of the ION demo. Collaborators: Thomas Mensink (UvA), Demond Elliott (UvA). Current student assistant: Oliver Becher. EURECA EURECA (Enabling information re-Use by linking clinical REsearch and Care) is a 10M â¬ EU FP7 project. The goal is to enable seamless, secure, scalable and consistent linkage of healthcare information residing in electronic health record (EHR) systems with information in clinical research information systems, such as clinical trials. I was workpackage leader of WP 6 on Applications, semantic reasoning and decision support. ImREAL ImREAL is an EU FP7 project on adaptive simulated learning. The main challenge is to connect the learning experience in the simulated environment with the real world and day-to-day job practice of the learners. During 2010/2011 I've been workpackage leader of WP4 on extended learner and context modeling. In this workpackage, we created semantic models to represent users and their real world context, explored ways to fill these models with usage data, and developed ontology alignment methods to match these models to Linked Open Data. Amongst other things we worked on U-Sem, a framework for the semantic enrichment and mining of people's profiles from usage data on the Social Web. See also the project description in Cordis. Political discourse in news Academy Assistant project, funded by the VUA Network Institute, together with Wouter van Atteveldt and Antske Fokkens. The focus is on NLP techniques, in particular sentiment analysis, to analyze and compare political debates and news. QHP The project Quantifying Historical Perspectives on WWII was funded by Amsterdam Data Science, 2014-2015. In this project we aim to quantify different perspectives on historical events. Check out our demonstrator or the paper about it at the TPDL conference. ShiftPol Academy Assistant project, funded by the VUA Network Institute. Does the relation between political logic and media logic shift over time? In the ShiftPol project Laura Hollink, Wouter van Atteveldt and three student assistants work on this question, building on the results of the PoliMedia project and the AMCAT toolkit. LiMePoDa Academy Assistant project Linking media and political data on pension reforms ran from 2012-2013 and was funded by the VUA Network Institute. The project aims to explain when proposals lead to debate in the media and how debates in the media lead to proposals by politicians. See also our website. Agora / Semantics of History Presentation: Agora User Committee Meeting 2013 by Lora Aroyo In 2009 I was involved in the AGORA: Semantics of History project, funded by the NWO Catch program and the Camera Institute at the VU University Amsterdam MuNCH Presentation: Final meeting of the MuNCH project by Laura Hollink The MUNCH project (Multimedia Analysis of Cultural Heritage) ran from 2006 to 2010 and was funded by the NWO Catch program. MUNCH is a cooperation between the VU, the UvA and the Dutch Institute for Sound and Vision. The aim was to improve search possibilities in the rich collection of Dutch television broadcasts that is archived at 'Sound and Vision', by combining three research directions: structured background knowledge in the form of ontologies or thesauri, language technologies and content-based image retrieval. MultiMedian E-culture I recommend everyone to play around with the E-Culture Web Demonstrator, which has won the Semantic Web Challenge 2006. ImIK Interactive Disclosure of Multimedia, Information and Knowledge. From 2002 until 2006 I worked as a PhD student in this project. On the 16th of November 2006 I defended my PhD thesis, titled Semantic annotation for retrieval of visual resources [PDF].
