In particular, she studies the computational and dynamical complexity of neural systems as well as genetic-networks. She would love to advance toward understanding how underlying architecture brings about the dynamics that evolve into intelligent behavior, and how behavior feedback from the dynamics proceeds toward adaptation in the architecture.
