Before that she was a postdoc researcher, supervised by Prof Nikos Aletras, on model interpretability, model hallucination and model compression. Back in 2020 she worked as a research assistant within the same department, working on NIHR-funded NLP projects for systematic reviews of public health research. She has served on the Programme Committee for AAAI, ACL and EMNLP. She is currently looking for highly-motivated PhD students, please contact her directly if you are interested.
