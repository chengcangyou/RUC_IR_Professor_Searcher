My research goal is to create artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that can solve any pathfinding problem, where the objective of a pathfinding problem is to find a sequence of actions that forms a path from a given start state to a given goal. The methods employed in my research group include deep learning, reinforcement learning, heuristic search, and formal logic.Pathfinding problems include robot path planning, theorem proving, chemical synthesis, program synthesis, and quantum circuit synthesis. Automating finding solutions to these problems with AI can result in rapid advancement of these fields. Furthermore, my research group seeks to incorporate explainable AI to enable collaboration with humans and to automate the discovery of new knowledge.More broadly, it is my opinion that AI is, at its core, the study of algorithms that write algorithms (i.e. meta-algorithms). Since writing an algorithm can be posed as a pathfinding problem, I believe that solving pathfinding is key to solving AI.I earned my Ph.D. in computer science at the University of California, Irvine, my M.S. in computer science at the University of Michigan, and my B.S. in electrical and computer engineering at The Ohio State University. Current Projects DeepCubeAG: Goal Specification for Pathfinding Expressive, high-level, goal specification is necessary when one knows what properties a goal must or must not have, but does not know what states meet these specifications. To accomplish this with deep neural networks, we incorporate formal logic with deep reinforcement learning to train heuristic functions that generalize over goals.Selected Papers:A Conflict-Driven Approach for Reaching Goals Specified with Negation as Failure, SoCS (2025)Specifying Goals for Deep Neural Networks with Answer Set Programming, ICAPS (2024) DeepCubeAI: Learning World Models (\"Imagination\") for Pathfinding Many pathfinding problems in real-world domains are not given world models and, thus, cannot make use of pathfinding algorithms. We seek to learn world models from real-world observations and use these learned world models to learn heuristic functions for pathfinding.Selected Papers:Learning Discrete World Models for Heuristic Search, Reinforcement Learning Conference (2024) DeepCubeAF: Foundation Models for Pathfinding While deep reinforcement learning can train informative heuristics for pathfinding, training can take hours to days for a single pathfinding  domain. To address this problem, we seek to train heuristic functions that can generalize over domains. Accomplishing this will make AI algorithms accessible to practitioners across a wide variety of disciplines and enable rapid adaptation of AI algorithms to dynamic real-world problems.Selected Papers:Towards Learning Foundation Models for Heuristic Functions to Solve Pathfinding Problems, AAAI GenPlan Workshop (2025)PDDLFuse: A Tool for Generating Diverse Planning Domains, AAAI GenPlan Workshop (2025) DeepCubeA: Artificial Intelligence Algorithms for Solving Pathfinding Problems We seek to create domain-independent machine learning methods that can learn domain-specific heuristic functions given only a description of a pathfinding domain. We have created DeepCubeA, a deep reinforcement learning and search algorithm capable of solving pathfinding problems, such as the Rubik's cube and other combinatorial puzzles, without human guidance.DeepCubeA WebserverSelected Papers:Q* Search: Heuristic Search with Deep Q-Networks, ICAPS PRL Workshop (2024)Solving the Rubik's Cube with Deep Reinforcement Learning and Search, Nature Machine Intelligence (2019) Applications to Real-World Pathfinding Problems Pathfinding problems are found throughout computing, robotics, mathematics, and the natural sciences. We aim to apply DeepCubeA, and its variants, to these problems with hopes of advancing the state-of-the-art in these fields.Selected Papers:Finding Reaction Mechanism Pathways with Deep Reinforcement Learning and Heuristic Search, ICAPS PRL Workshop (2024) Learning Activation Functions Artificial neural networks typically have a fixed, non-linear activation function at each neuron. We have designed a novel form of piecewise linear activation function that is learned though gradient descent. With this adaptive activation function, we are able to improve upon deep neural network architectures that use static activation functions.Selected Papers:SPLASH: Learnable Activation Functions for Improving Accuracy and Adversarial Robustness, Neural Networks, (2021)Learning Activation Functions to Improve Deep Neural Networks, ICLR Workshop, (2015) Updates 07/2025: We will be hosting the AI4Science Summer Camp at USC06/2025: Awarded two ASPIRE-AI grants from USC VPR on quantum algorithm compilation and HIV drug synthesis05/2025: One paper accepted at SoCS 202503/2025: I will be leading a week of the SC INBRE Data Science Workshop (GitHub)01/2025: I will be co-organizing the 2025 GenPlan Workshop at AAAI, two workshop papers accepted (1,2)  09/2024: I will be presenting my research at the RLeap Symposium.09/2024: Awarded an NSF grant from Robust Intelligence on scalable heuristic learning05/2024: One paper accepted at the Reinforcement Learning Conference, 2024 4/2024: Four workshop papers accepted at ICAPS 2024: PRL (1,2), HAXP, HSDIP2/2024: I will be giving a master class on deep learning, reinforcement learning, and heuristic search at SoCS 2024.2/2024: One paper accepted to ICAPS 202409/2023: Awarded an NSF-MRI grant 05/2023: Awarded an ASPIRE-I grant from the Office of the Vice President for Research04/2023: Awarded a MADE in SC grant from the South Carolina EPSCOR program06/2022: One paper published in Nucleic Acids Research06/2022: One paper published in the AAAI 2022 - Demonstration Track02/2022: One paper published in Nature Communications04/2021: Awarded two ASPIRE-II grants from the USC VPR03/2021: One paper published in Neural NetworksAll Updates Research Gallery AllPreviousNextClose Make your own site - Click here",
