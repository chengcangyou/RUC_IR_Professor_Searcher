During Summer 2022 I was a visiting researcher at the Institute of Informatics and Telecommunications at the National Centre for Scientific Research \"Demokritos\" in Athens, Greece. I earned my PhD from the School of Computer Science in College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), advised by Ada Gavrilovska. At Georgia Tech, my research introduced system-level support for the resource management of extremely heterogeneous hardware. In particular, my dissertation adds machine intelligence to hybrid memory management. This graduation profile featured in GT Computing news and the Daily Digest nicely summarizes my academic journey. During my PhD, I have interned at DellEMC in Santa Clara (CA, USA), VMWare in Palo Alto (CA, USA) and AMD Research in Bellevue (WA, USA), where part of my work has been patented. Prior to PhD, I received an undegraduate Diploma in ECE, majoring in Computer Science, from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at National Technical University of Athens in Greece. In 2024, I received the 'César Nombela' award grant. IMDEA News In 2021, I received the 'Juan de la Cierva' award grant. IMDEA News In 2020, I was selected as a Rising Star in EECS. Link GT News I am passionate about mentoring and taking actions to promote diversity, equity and inclusion in academia, working towards bridging the gender gap in STEM. I am serving as a treasurer for the ACM-W Greece Chapter, elected for the 2025-2026 term. I am a member of the organization team of Greek Women in STEM. I am a member of the organization team of the MAR chapter of Women in HPC (High Performance Computing). Listen to my career and life journey: - Researcher's Night in Greece | Podcast in Greek - A Seat at the Table Podcast | Podcast in English The Muse Lab I lead the Muse lab (ML), where we are working at the research intersection of Machine Learning and Operating System(MLSys). Check out our GitHub page and publications below. [Systems for Machine Learning] Build systems software that improves the inference performance and efficiency of machine learning applications, such as Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs).
