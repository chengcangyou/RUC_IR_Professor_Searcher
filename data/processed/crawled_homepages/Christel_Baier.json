From the University of Mannheim she received her Diploma in Mathematics in 1990, her Ph.D. in Computer Science in 1994, and her Habilitation in 1999. She was an associate professor for Theoretical Computer Science at the University of Bonn from 1999 till 2006. Since September 2022, she holds an honorary doctorate (Dr. rer. nat. h.c.) from RWTH Aachen. She is dean of the Faculty for Computer Science at TU Dresden (2025-2027) and served as vice-dean in the period 2019-2024.
