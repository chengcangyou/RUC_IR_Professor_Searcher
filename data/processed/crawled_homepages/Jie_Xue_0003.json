Before joining NYU Shanghai, I was a postdoctoral scholar at University of California, Santa Barbara, hosted by Prof. Subhash Suri and Prof. Daniel Lokshtanov. I obtained my PhD degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics at University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Ravi Janardan. Here is my CV. My research mainly focuses on some branches of theoretical computer science including computational geometry, algorithms, data structures, graph theory, etc. A list of my publications can be found via the \"Publications\" link on the left side. Besides computer science, I have a general interest in (both pure and applied) mathematics. My knowledge in mathematics mainly distributes in branches of algebra and topology (e.g., commutative algebra, homological algebra, algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, etc.) and branches strongly related to computer science (e.g., combinatorics, probability theory, graph theory, etc.). My Erdős number is 3. I have a strong inclination in Chinese traditional culture (especially philosophy and literature). I like poetry, calligraphy, I Ching, guqin, etc. I am a disciple of Laotze and his philosophical Taoism.",
