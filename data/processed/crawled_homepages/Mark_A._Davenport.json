Davenport Professor and Associate Chair for Graduate Affairs School of Electrical & Computer Engineering Center for Signal and Information Processing Center for Machine Learning Georgia Institute of Technology Contact information CV || Biography || Academic genealogy I am a Professor and the Associate Chair for Graduate Affairs in the School of Electrical & Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am a member of the Center for Machine Learning and the Center for Signal and Information Processing. My research interests lie in the intersection of the fields of signal processing, high-dimensional statistics, and machine learning. I am particularly interested in the fundamental role that low-dimensional models and optimization play in these fields. News Received the Richard M.
