I am also an affiliate of the Data Science Institute at UW-Madison. My main research interests are in the area of large-scale optimization. I am also interested in applications of optimization methods, particularly within machine learning. Prior to joining UW-Madison, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Berkeley's Foundations of Data Analysis (FODA) TRIPODS Institute, where I primarily worked with Mike Jordan. In Fall 2018, I was a Microsoft Research Fellow at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, associated with the program on Foundations of Data Science. Prior to starting the postdoctoral position at UC Berkeley, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at the Department of Computer Science, Boston University, where I worked with Lorenzo Orecchia. I completed my Ph.D. at the Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, where I was co-advised by Gil Zussman and Cliff Stein. Some of my publications are under my maiden name -- MaraÅ¡eviÄ. Prospective students: I am receiving a large volume of email and cannot respond to individual requests. All of the graduate students in the CS program at UW-Madison are admitted by the department, not by individual faculty. Thus, I can only respond to requests from students who are already admitted to UW-Madison. I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Sciences and (by courtesy) the Department of Statistics at UW-Madison. I am also an affiliate of the Data Science Institute at UW-Madison. My full CV can be found here. My maiden name is MaraÅ¡eviÄ. Research Interests First-order convex and non-convex optimization algorithms; momentum-based methods Variational inequalities and fixed-point iterations Optimization in learning applications; Width-independent algorithms (optimization on a relative scale) Lower bounds in optimization Selected Honors & Awards Google ML & Systems Junior Faculty Award (2025) NSF CAREER Award (2025) AFOSR Young Investigator Program award (2024) UW-Madison Provost's Award for Mentoring Undergraduates In Research, Scholarly, and Creative Activities (2023) Simons-Berkeley Research Fellowship and Microsoft Research Fellowship (2018) Morton B.
