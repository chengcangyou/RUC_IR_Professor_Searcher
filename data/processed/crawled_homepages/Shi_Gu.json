Professional Bio: I am now a tenured associate professor at the Zhejiang University, where I am leading the Brain and Intelligence group at the State Key Lab of Brain Machine Intelligence. I completed my Ph.D. degree under the supervision of Dr. Dani S. Bassett from the Complex System Group at the University of Pennsylvania. Before that, I spent four years (2007-2011) in Tsinghua University for my undergraduate degree in the Academic Talent Program, majoring in mathematics and physics. Research Interests: Our main interest is the Brain-inspired Alignment Intelligence, i.e. modelling brain-like structure, learning through plasticity, and reasoning towards alignment. Specially, it covers computational neuroscience, brain inspired intelligence, medical imaging analysis, neural encoding and decoding, and spiking neural networks. I am looking for self-motivated students, postdoctoral researchers, and research assistants to join our team. If you are interested in working with me, welcome to send me an email or fill in Application to Brain and Intelligence Lab. I am open to exploring remote collaborations as well.
