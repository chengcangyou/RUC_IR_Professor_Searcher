Previously, I was a postdoc at New York University hosted by Oded Regev and Subhash Khot, and a research fellow at Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing. I received my PhD from Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by Venkatesan Guruswami and my thesis won the Edmund M. Clarke Doctoral Dissertation Award. I was supported by Samsung Scholarship and Simons Award for Graduate Students in TCS. With Nicole Wein, I am organizing Michigan Theory Seminar. Please reach out any of the organizers if you would like to give a talk! Email (First name with eight letters) at umich dot edu Teaching EECS 598-010.
