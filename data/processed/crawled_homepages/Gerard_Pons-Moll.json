Current computer vision algorithms can detect people in images or estimate 2D keypoints to a remarkable accuracy. However, people are far more complexâ-we effortlessly sense other people's emotional state based on facial expressions and body movements, or we make guesses about people's preferences based on what clothing they wear. Our goal is to build virtual humans that look, move and eventually think like real ones.
