CHEUNG (張成志) Chair Professor of Computer Science and Engineering CASTLE Research Group Department of Computer Science and Engineering The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Shing-Chi (S.C.) Cheung received his Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the University of Hong Kong, and his PhD degree in Computing from the Imperial College London. After doctoral graduation, he joined the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) where he is a Chair Professor of Computer Science and Engineering. He founded the CASTLE research group at HKUST and co-founded in 2006 the International Workshop on Automation of Software Testing (AST). He is a Senior Associate Editor of the ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM). He serves on the editorial board of Science of Computer Programming (SCP) and Journal of Computer Science and Technology (JCST). He was an editorial board member of the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE, 2006-9) and Information and Software Technology (IST, 2012-5). He participates actively in the program and organizing committees of major international software engineering conferences. He chaired the 19th Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference (APSEC) in 1996, 1997 and 2012. He was the General Chair of the 22nd ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE 2014). He is an extended member of the ACM SIGSOFT executive committee. He owns seven patents in China and the United States. His research interests focus on the use of advanced testing, analysis, AI techniques and empirical experimentation techniques for the detection, diagnosis and repair of faults in dependable and intelligent software systems. He is an ACM Distinguished Member and an IEEE Fellow. Note: Traveling direction to our campus is available here. Campus lift plan is available here. (Virtual campus tour / Google Map of HKUST) Research interests Software engineering - To enhance software quality and process using generative AI, benchmark constructions, testing, fault detection, program repair, synthesis and software analytics. Target applications include AI applications, open-source projects, deep learning systems, mobile apps, web applications, blockchain applications (including smart contracts and DApps), and spreadsheets.

Big congrats to Jialun! I am recruiting highly devoted PhD students who are interested in software testing and analysis, software security, software engineering for AI, and AI for software engineering. Qualified applicants must be competent Java and C++ programmers with strong motivation to conduct basic research and empirical experiments. They should have solid knowledge on software engineering, testing, compilers, algorithms, concurrency and data mining/machine learning. Experience in the participation of open-source projects is particularly welcome. Please send me an email with your resume and a recent photograph if you are interested. First year PhD students of Computer Science & Engineering (HKUST) who have not yet identified their supervisors are also welcome. Elite PhD students recruited may also consider to join our dual PhD degrees program with the University of Waterloo. The students will be co-supervised by me and my research collaborator in the University of Waterloo. Are you occupied by worries? Look at the birds flying around: they do not sow seeds, gather a harvest and put it in barns; yet your Father in heaven takes care of them! Aren't you worth much more than birds? Can any of you live a bit longer by worrying about it? Instead be concerned above everything else with the Kingdom of God and with what your Father requires of you, and he will provide you with all these other things. So do not worry about tomorrow; it will have enough worries of its own. There is no need to add to the troubles each day brings.
