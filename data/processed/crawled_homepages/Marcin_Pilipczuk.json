In the academic year 2022/23 I am on sabbatical at BARC, Copenhagen. During Fall 2015 I was a research fellow at Simons Institute for Theory of Computing for the Fine-grained complexity and algorithm design program. In the academic year 2014/15 I was a post-doc at University of Warwick. In the academic year 2013/14 I was a post-doc at University of Bergen. I co-authored a textbook \"Parameterized Algorithms\" (Springer 2015).Go to a webpage of the book where you can download a free personal PDF copy. My research interests lies mostly in algorithmics, especially fixed parameter tractability and exact computations of NP-hard problems, as well as structural graph theory. Sometimes I study approximation algorithms. I am the PI of a National Science Centre SONATA BIS grant Structural and algorithmic properties of hereditary graph classes that starts in July 2023. I was the PI of two other grants: ERC Starting Grant CUTACOMBS, Cuts and decompositions: algorithms and combinatorial properties. Homing grant, Recent trends in kernelization: theory and experimental evaluation. Member of the Editorial Board of SIAM Journal on Computing and ACM Transactions on Algorithms.
