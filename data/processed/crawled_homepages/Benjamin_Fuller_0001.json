Close UConn University of Connecticut Search University of Connecticut Search UConn A to Z Index UConn A to Z Index Site A-Z UConn A-Z About me I am an associate professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Connecticut. I'm a co-director of the Connecticut Advanced Computing Center. Prior to joining UConn I was a cryptographic researcher building secure systems at MIT Lincoln Laboratory from 2007-2016 in the Secure, Resilient Systems and Technology Group. I completed my Ph.D. at Boston University. While at BU I contributed to the BUSEC group.  You can follow me on twitter at @fuzzycrypto My primary research area is cryptography spanning from complexity/reduction-based cryptography, information theory, and applied cryptography necessary to deploy systems. Ideally, I'm able to take a real problem, develop a theoretically sound approach, and work with others to implement a proof of concept. The CSE and ECE departments jointly organize a security seminar.  Please contact me to join the mailing list.  We're always looking for exciting speakers. I also work with UConn's cyber security club. I encourage interested students to attend a meeting or talk to me about possible problems in cyber security. I keep my CV up to date and I try and include all updates on this site as well.  My google scholar page is also a good reference for my research. Office Hours I am in the office most days and hold advising hours 11am on Fridays (schedule through nexus.uconn.edu).
