As this technology convergence continues, it will become possible that computers integrated with sensing and communication can interact with humans and environments in fine-granular real-time. With such fine-granular real-time interactions, computer systems can provide intelligent and proactive services such as real-time autonomous driving and flying for future smart mobility, real-time monitoring and assistance for the elderly, detecting and caring for mental health problems of young students, which makes our daily lives more secure and enjoyable. To realize such real-time ubiquitous systems, we are conducting theoretical and practical research including resource scheduling and optimization for autonomous vehicles, safety and efficiency guarantee for UAM (Urban Air Mobility), and mental health care AI based on K-12 students' daily digital activities.",
