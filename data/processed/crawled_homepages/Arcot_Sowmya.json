She obtained her PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay  in 1992. Dr Sowmya teaches courses in computer vision and learning , pattern recognition and robotics.  These courses are at the third and fourth year level, which are advanced electives at the fourth year level. Dr Sowmya's research is in two areas: image analysis and recognition, and software engineering. The first area focuses on segmentation and classification of images, with techniques drawn from machine learning, pattern recognition and statistical data analysis. A major application focus has been on feature extraction, recognition and understanding of high resolution images, in particular satellite and aerial images and medical images. Motion segmentation and classification in video images in another major application area, in particular motion tracking in AVIE at the iCinema centre, and face tracking. Past and current research projects include road network extraction from high resolution aerial images and digital maps, symbolic learning techniques for object recognition, real-time resampling and tracking algorithms  and motion tracking and recognition for interactive cinema and medical image understanding and diagnosis on HRCT images of the lung. The second area of interest focuses on formal methods of specification, verification and design of real-time, reactive and distributed systems. Techniques are based on process algebras, temporal logic, simulation and deduction. Past and current projects include  verification of statecharts using logic-based techniques, real-time (robot) control software development using Esterel, design reuse techniques for component-based embedded system development and protocol modelling and verification for on-chip communication protocols as well as web service protocols.",
