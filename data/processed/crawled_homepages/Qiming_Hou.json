I received my BS degree in Academic Talent Program and PhD degree in computer science, both from Tsinghua University. As a part of my PhD program, I spent four years in Microsoft Research Asia as an intern researcher. I've been working on GPGPU programming languages and tools, rendering systems and GPGPU applications. My current research interest is vector graphics rendering, face-tracking, and light transport simulation.
