MacKay (1922-1987). My current research is in Theology and Science, and Analytic Theology. I am an Honorary Research Fellow at ETS (and on the ETS Senate, and Seminary Board). I am also a singer and obtained a diploma from Trinity College London (LTCL) in 2014. I give recitals, and am building up my portfolio.

While there I completed an M.Sc. by research in an area of Artificial Intelligence. This led me to pursue an academic career, to which end I undertook a PhD in the Intelligent Systems Laboratory at Heriot-Watt University on the topic of Fuzzy Qualitative Reasoning. My first academic appointment was in the University of Wales, Aberystwyth  (1997 – 2002), where I extended my research interests to include Scientific Discovery. After that I returned to Aberdeen as a SL in Computing Science. I was promoted to Reader in 2009, and to a Chair in 2011. At Aberdeen I have had a number of roles. I was Head of Computing Science (2010-2014); Director of Research and a Deputy Head of the School of Natural and Computing Sciences (2015 – 2018). I have served on a several committees in the institution including the Academic Standards Committee (Post-graduate), the Quality Assurance Committee, and the Research Policy Committee. I have also done a few stints on Senate.
