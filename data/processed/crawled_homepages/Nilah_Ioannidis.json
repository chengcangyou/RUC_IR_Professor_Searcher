Her group works on computational methods to analyze and interpret personal genomes, including machine learning and deep learning methods to predict the clinical impact of genome variation and to model variation in gene expression and other molecular and cellular phenotypes.View recent publications: Google ScholarDr. Ioannidis was previously a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Biomedical Data Science at Stanford University, where she worked on several machine learning tools to predict the pathogenicity of single nucleotide variants, including the ensemble predictor REVEL for missense variants. During her PhD in Biophysics at Harvard University, she worked in the Department of Biological Engineering at MIT and developed methods to analyze the dynamics of intracellular particles using hidden Markov modeling and Bayesian inference. She also previously served as Research Director at the Jain Foundation, a non-profit foundation focused on the rare genetic disease dysferlinopathy.Recent awards:Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Investigator Award (2022-2027)Computational Transformation Fellow, UC Noyce Initiative (2022-2023)Okawa Foundation Research Grant (2021)NIH K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award (2017-2022) Education 2013, Ph.D., Biophysics, Harvard University Research Areas Biosystems & Computational Biology (BIO) Artificial Intelligence (AI) Research Centers Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab (BAIR) Center for Computational Biology (CCB)",
