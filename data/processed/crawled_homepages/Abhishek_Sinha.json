Prior to joining TIFR, I was with the Dept. of Electrical Engineering at IIT Madras as an Assistant Professor. I recieved my Ph.D. from MIT, where I designed the first efficient and throughput-optimal algorithm for the generalized network flow problem. At MIT, I was advised by Prof. Eytan Modiano at the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems. Our work was recognized with two best paper awards at top-tier international venues. I spent two wonderful summers at Bell Labs (Murray Hill, NJ) and Microsoft (Redmond, WA), working on resource-allocation problems. After my Ph.D., I worked at Qualcomm Research, San Diego, on efficient scheduling algorithms for 5G systems. I obtained my Master's degree from the Electrical Communication Engineering department at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, and a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engg. from Jadavpur University, Kolkata.
