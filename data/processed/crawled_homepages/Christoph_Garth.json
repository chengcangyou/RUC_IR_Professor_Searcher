After studying Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Kaiserslautern and obtaining a Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2007, Christoph was a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Data Analysis and Visualization at the University of California, Davis. Since 2011, he has been an assistant professor in Computer Science at the University of Kaiserslautern, and became a full professor in 2017. Christophâs research agenda encompasses large-scale data analysis and visualization, in-situ visualization, topology-based methods in visualization, and interdisciplinary applications of visualization. His goal is to develop theoretical insights into relevant and practical visualization techniques. He has helped pioneer Lagrangian techniques in flow visualization and demonstrate their utility in in situ scenarios. Christoph has received an Award for Excellence in Postdoctoral Research, multiple best paper awards. Over the past ten years, he has been a frequent reviewer for leading international journals (IEEE TVCG, IEEE CG&A, Computer Graphics Forum, etc.) and conferences (IEEE Visualization, ACM Supercomputing, etc.). Christoph has served as general chair and paper chair of TopoInVis, and is a member of the TopoInVis workshop series steering committee. He currently serves as a co-chair for the IEEE Symposium on Large Data Analysis and Visualization.

The tracking of workpieces through their production process, for example, unlocks a detailed understanding of timings, patterns, and bottlenecks. While research mostly focuses on technological advancements, the analysis of the generated data is often left unclear. We propose a visual analysis framework based on ultra-wide-band (UWB) RTLS tracking data of material flow for this purpose. With this, we present an analysis and define a practical approach for how factory-level data can be analyzed. Advanced algori",
