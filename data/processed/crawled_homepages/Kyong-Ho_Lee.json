Students Alumni Dr. Kyong-Ho Lee ì´ê²½í¸ Professor I have joined the Computer Science department at Yonsei University since 2002. I received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from Yonsei University in 1995, 1997, and 2001, respectively. Before joining Yonsei University, I worked as a researcher in the IT Laboratories at NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), Maryland USA. I was a visiting professor at the School of Information and Computer Sciences of University of California at Irvine, during my sabbatical leave from Sep. 2008 to Aug. 2009. My research focus is mainly on Knowledge Representation and Learning and I am leading the Internet Computing lab in the Computer Science department. Specifically, during the past five years, I tried to contribute a lot to the development of the theoretical and technical foundations of knowledge graphs. Recently, I am doing research on constructing and completing knowledge graphs by extracting and predicting factual knowledge from unstructured sources. Another line of research is to utilize knowledge graphs to a variety of downstream tasks like recommender systems and dialogue models. As academic community services, I have been working as editorial board members in international and domestic journals as well as frequent reviewers of journals and magazines. I have also worked as a member of the program or organizing committee of international conferences such as WWW, AAAI, SIGIR. 02 2123 5712 khlee89@yonsei.ac.kr",
