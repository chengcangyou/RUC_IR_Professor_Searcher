My research group is part of the Distributed Systems Laboratory, the Security and Privacy Laboratory, and The Warren Center for Network and Data Sciences. I'm the recipient of an NSF CAREER Award, a JPMorgan Faculty Award, the ACM SIGOPS Dennis M. Ritchie Dissertation Award, and the Bert Kay Best Dissertation Award. I was previously at Microsoft Research. My work is on distributed systems, operating systems, and applied cryptography. Projects I'm working on include: ZK Languages: Building zero-knowledge proof systems for optimization, search, and parsing tasks, as well as building languages for implementing zero-knowledge proof systems. Serverless: Make serverless correct, fault tolerant, and efficient. LDOS: Designing the next generation of OSes that automatically adapt to applications and their environment. TIDES: Building a privacy-preserving cross-organization data integration service.
