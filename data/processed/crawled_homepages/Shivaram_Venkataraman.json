My research interests are in designing systems and algorithms for large scale data analysis and machine learning. My dissertation research looked at abstractions that make it easier to express new machine learning algorithms and systems that can improve their performance. Before coming to Madison, I was a post-doctoral researcher in the Systems Research Group at Microsoft Research in Redmond. Previously, I completed my PhD from UC Berkeley where I was advised by Ion Stoica and Mike Franklin. I also have a Masters from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and worked in the Systems Research Group, with Prof. Roy Campbell.
