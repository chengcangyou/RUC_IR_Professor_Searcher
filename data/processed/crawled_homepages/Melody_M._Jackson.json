Dr. Jackson holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech (1998).  Her dissertation work in user interface reengineering combined the areas of Human-Computer Interface and Software Engineering, and her minor was Postsecondary Education.  Dr. Jackson also holds a B.A. in Computer Science with a minor in Business Administration from The University of Texas at Austin (1980), and the M.S. of Information and Computer Science from Georgia Tech 1988). Prior to returning to Georgia Tech in January 2006, Dr. Jackson was an Associate Professor in the Computer Information Systems Department at Georgia State University, where she created and directed the GSU BrainLab.  Before GSU, Dr. Jackson was a Senior Research Scientist at Georgia Tech for nine years, creating and directing the Open Systems lab, and teaching Software Engineering. Before coming to academia, she worked for nine years in industry as a professional software engineer developing real-time embedded systems, secure operating systems, networking, and compilers. Companies included Texas Instruments, Sperry, and National Semiconductor. Research Interests Biometric Interfaces and Brain-Computer Interfaces My current major research focus is on direct control of computers and devices from human brain signals.  Working with our collaborators, we have experience with both invasive (implanted) techniques and noninvasive (scalp electrode) techniques. Our immediate goal is to provide people with \"locked in syndrome\" (completely paralyzed and unable to speak) a means of communication and environmental control.  Eventually we hope that we may be able to use the brain signals to restore motion to paralyzed limbs. I direct the GT Brainlab which involves students and faculty from Georgia Tech and Georgia State University. Our current sponsors include the National Science Foundation, NIDRR, and the National Institutes of Health.  Current projects include: BioGauges - a toolset to measure human abilities with biometric systems to determine the best fit for each individual Neural Internet - a suite of tools that provide neurally-controlled internet access for BCI users. The Aware 'Chair - a neurally-controlled wheelchair that provides environmental control and communications based on contextual information, such as who is in the room, time of day, user habits and routines, and conversational history. Functional Near Infrared (fNIR) imaging - studying user interfaces for direct brain interfaces based on changes in blood volume and oxygenation Steady State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) - studying the possibilities of information from the visual cortex User Interface Reengineering Another ongoing research focus is in reengineering and transitioning legacy information system user interfaces to new environments. The Model Oriented Reengineering Process for HCI (MORPH) technique and toolset support migration from character-oriented user interfaces to graphical user interfaces. A rule base is employed with pattern-matching techniques to detect and build a model of the legacy user interface. A knowledge base is used to represent the user interface domain model and also to store the user interface models and assist in transforming the application model to the new environment.

For information on the CCI Southeast region, check out the Southeast Region Website. Horses have always been a passion of mine and I have taught hunter/jumper and dressage for twenty years, owning a riding school in Dallas 1980-1985.   I currently ride dressage with my daughter.
