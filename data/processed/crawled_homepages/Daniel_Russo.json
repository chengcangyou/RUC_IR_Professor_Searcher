Start Today How I can Help Contact Me About Me My path in tech began long before titles or academic roles. I’ve always been curious about how things work and why some ideas take shape while others fade. That curiosity eventually led me to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Bologna, a place where I learned not just to research, but to ask better questions. After completing my doctorate, I followed opportunities that pushed me to explore new ways of thinking and collaborating. Each step shaped the way I approach software engineering today, blending research with real-world impact. Now, as a tenured Associate Professor at Aalborg University in Copenhagen, I focus on bringing clarity and structure to complex problems. I rely heavily on a scientific mindset, not as a slogan, but as a daily habit. It guides how I work with teams, mentor students, and build ideas that last. Over the years, my work has received awards and has been shared across both academic and industry settings. But what motivates me most is seeing how thoughtful research can help people build better technology, make smarter decisions, and create solutions they’re proud of. Connect on LinkedIn → Research Interests: Solving Challenges with a Scientific Mindset My research centers on applying scientific inquiry to address critical issues in software engineering and AI. Key focus areas include: Effective Software Teams: Understanding the dynamics that make high-performing teams. AI Adoption within the software development lifecycle: Enhancing software processes with human-centered AI solutions. Diversity and inclusion within software engineering teams: Creating equitable and productive team environments. Pandemic transformation and its impact on software development: Investigating how global events reshape software practices. Advanced research methodologies in software engineering: Leveraging robust methods to produce actionable insights. Through my research, I strive to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical applications, empowering organizations to innovate with confidence. My Research Academic Contributions I have published over 50 peer-reviewed journal articles, conference papers, and book chapters. My notable works include studies on AI adoption in software engineering, the effectiveness of agile scaling approaches, and the well-being and productivity of developers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, I serve as a member at the Danish Young Academy of Technology, Science, and Innovation, contributing to the advancement of research and technology at a national level. My Research Professional Engagements: Driving Impact Through Collaboration My professional activities are rooted in driving transformation through a scientific mindset, enabling collaboration between academia and industry: The Annual Copenhagen Symposium on Human-Centered Software Engineering AI:Funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the Carlsberg Foundation, this annual event connects experts to discuss the future of AI and software engineering, culminating in the Copenhagen Manifesto. Software Engineering Incubator:A bi-annual gathering in Copenhagen that bridges the gap between academic researchers and technology decision-makers, fostering collaboration and actionable innovation. Consultancy for the Private Sector:I offer evidence-driven consultancy services, helping organizations implement tailored processes and tools for software engineering and AI transformation. By leveraging scientifically validated methodologies, I deliver measurable improvements that align with organizational goals. Whether through research partnerships, workshops, or consultancy, my goal is to use the scientific mindset to create meaningful, scalable solutions. The Copenhagen Symposium Software Engineering Incubator Consultancy & Advisory Teaching and Mentorship: Inspiring the Next Generation At Aalborg University, I offer academic courses at all levels, including bachelor, master, and PhD programs. My teaching portfolio are in the area of software engineering. At a graduate level, I teach a PhD course on Structural Equation Modelling, for which I have co-authored the methodological guidelines for the computing community, and a PhD course on Human-Centered AI, grounded in the Copenhagen Manifesto that I curated. I am deeply committed to guiding the next generation of software engineers and researchers, supervising numerous student projects. As an advocate of Liberating Structures (LS), I integrate these powerful methods into my teaching to foster innovative, inclusive, and highly interactive learning environments. Liberating Structures enable students to engage more deeply, think creatively, and collaborate effectively, breaking down traditional barriers to participation and unlocking the full potential of every individual in the classroom. My Teaching Embrace the Scientific Mindset At the heart of my work lies a commitment to the scientific mindset—the practice of making decisions rooted in evidence, analysis, and critical inquiry rather than personal anecdotes intuition alone. By leveraging this approach, we can transcend guesswork, unlock deeper insights, and create solutions that are not only innovative but also robust and sustainable in this era of AI Transformation. Whether you’re investigating interesting challenges in academia or driving change in industry, adopting a scientific mindset empowers you to tackle complexity with clarity and purpose. I invite you to explore its transformative potential. Together, we can advance software engineering, harness the possibilities of AI, and shape the future of innovation.
