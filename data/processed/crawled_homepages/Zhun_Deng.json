I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University, hosted by Toniann Pitassi and Richard Zemel. I completed my Ph.D. in the Theory of Computation group at Harvard University under the guidance of Cynthia Dwork. Prior to Harvard, I received my B.Sc. in Mathematics from Chu Kochen Honors College, Zhejiang University. I am broadly interested in problems at the frontier of machine learning, statistics, and theoretical computer science. My goal is to introduce rigorous theoretical tools to establish practically useful frameworks for efficient, safe, and responsible machine learning.News09/2025 - Two papers accepted by NeurIPS 2025: statistical inference under performativity and performative risk control. 05/2025 - Two papers accepted by ICML 2025: auto-evaluation of tail behaviors of LLMs and conformal tail risk control for LLM alignment. 01/2025 - I start as an assistant professor at UNC CS!Click here for older newsGoogle SitesReport abuseGoogle SitesReport abuse",
