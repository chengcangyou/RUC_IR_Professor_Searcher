Before joining UMSI, Jiayu was a professor of computer science at Michigan State University. Jiayu received his Ph.D. degree in computer science at Arizona State University in 2014. Jiayu has a broad research interest in large-scale machine learning, generative AI, AI+Health and broad AI+X (integrating AI with application domains denoted by \"X\" to enhance, innovate, or transform the domain). To Prospective Students: ILLIDAN Lab is always looking for motivated Ph.D. students and post-doctoral researchers on machine learning research and AI+X. Interested candidates please email your CV and transcripts. Note: I may not be able to reply and confirm every application email, but you will be notified for an interview if you are shortlisted. Research Highlights Jiayu's research is anchored in the vision of Unified Knowledge Integration - an innovative approach that harnesses AI to unify insights from large-scale, noisy, multimodal, and heterogeneous datasets. By seamlessly integrating domain knowledge with novel machine learning and generative AI techniques, we aim to transform various real-world domains, enhance decision making for data science through establishing the closed-loop flow of informatics among key components of human, data, and analytics. Please visit ILLIDAN Lab for projects, publication and research activities. Machine Learning and AI+X Foundation: Knowledge Transfer and Integration Jiayu has been working in the area of transfer learning which integrates domain knowledge from multiple sources to improve the generalization performance of machine learning models. His research focuses on multi-task learning, i.e., performing inductive knowledge transfer between multiple related learning tasks and improving the generalization performance simultaneously for all different tasks. Jiayu is the author of multi-task learning open-source software MALSAR. Machine Learning and AI+X Foundation: Fusion of Information from Multiple Sources In health informatics, complex underlying factors often contribute to events of interest, such as mortality, disease progression, and readmission. These events can be correlated to various variables from different sources. Jiayu's lab has been developing information fusion approaches that integrate multiple data sources/views as well as domain knowledge and information diffusion algorithms that transfer predictive knowledge between related analytics tasks. Machine Learning and AI+X Foundation: Consolidating Data from Different Locations A main obstacle to data analytics in the field of health informatics is the scattered nature of medical data, which is often dispersed across various locations. Distributed medical data presents critical challenges. Jiayu's lab has developed a suite of federated learning algorithms that provide privacy-preserving and fair predictive modeling from multiple collaborating parties with heterogeneous data distributions. AI+Health: Early Diagnosis of Dementia Jiayu has developed advanced disease progression models for Alzheimer’s, integrating data from electronic medical records (EHR) and brain imaging. These models effectively tackle challenges such as data sparsity, inconsistency, and high-dimensional features by combining multiple imaging modalities and leveraging insights from other neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, Jiayu's team explore how to leverage large-language models (LLMs) to improve early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s. Check out the preprint on exciting and surprising results based on a study using EHR from 2.5 million patients. AI+Health: Language Markers and Chatbots for Dementia One major research direction of Jiayu is to create digital biomarkers from conversations and daily behavior, offering affordable and accessible tools for early dementia screening. His team has also developed a chatbot to quickly gather language markers, significantly enhancing early-stage dementia prediction. Recently, his team is developing a chatbot that provides therapeutic treatment using Large-Language Models. AI+Health: Drug Discovery Jiayu's lab has been developing deep-learning models that can predict new therapeutic drug candidates by utilizing existing drug profiles from related disease models and identifying new drug targets. Jiayu's lab developed data-driven molecular fingerprint that leverages domain knowledge and enables cost-effective drug discovery through the virtual screening of chemical compounds, and a framework to search new molecules with desired properties. His lab is working on multi-modal foundation models that enables collaborative drug discovery with human experts. Teaching Jiayu is developing new curriculums at both undergraduate and graduate levels, that incorporate the state-of-the-art machine learning research into classroom.

Some words keep me moving forward A job well done is its own reward. You take pride in the things you do, not for others to see, not for the respect, or glory, or any other rewards it might bring. You take pride in what you do, because you're doing your best. If you believe in something, you stick with it. When things get difficult, you try harder. Last updated on Jan 2024",
