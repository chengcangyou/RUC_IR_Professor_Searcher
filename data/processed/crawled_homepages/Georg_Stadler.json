Presently, my main driving applications are in climate modeling and inference, fusion, and geophysics. Activities/Roles: Teaching: In fall 2023 I’ll teach Scientific Computing, and co-teach a PhD-level class on Computational PDEs. Organization: I’m co-organizing Courant’s Computational Mathematics and Scientific Computing Seminar Funding: My research was supported by NSF (DMS-1723211 and is currently supported by an ONR Muri and the Simons Foundation. Group: Current PhD students: Sonia Reilly (NYU). Former PhD students: Chen Li, Shanyin Tong, Melody Shih, Karina Koval, Yair Daon (NYU), Tobin Isaac and Johann Rudi (both at UT Austin, co-advised with Omar Ghattas). Current postdocs at NYU: Fortino Garcia, Gabriel Provencher-Langlois. Recent former postdocs at NYU: Andrew Giuliani, Matt Dunlop, Florian Wechsung, Andy Davis, Huy Dinh. Postdoc/student opportunities: We are always looking for motivated PhD students and postdocs to join the group. PhD students should apply through Courant’s Mathematics (or CS) PhD program. If you are interested in working in my group as a postdoc (and have read some of my work), please email me. I am in the process of updating this site (as of Dec 2022). © G.St.",
