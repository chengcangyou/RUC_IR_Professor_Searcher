These are forces of change that my research impacts. I investigate climate responsive design techniques at both the city and the neighborhood scales to help cities become more resilient in the face of climate change. My research examines the relationship between urban agriculture, urban form, and urban heat by investigating ways to integrate urban agriculture into the fabric of American cities. I aim to investigate design techniques that make ecological processes visible to urban residents through the use of distributed infrastructure and multipurpose green infrastructure. I further explore the intersection of environmental sensing and community empowerment and look forward to using everyday pervasive technologies to help individuals turn their local environmental data into knowledge. \"I fundamentally believe that it is essential for everyone to have access to local environmental information and be provided with an understanding of how their environment impacts their health.\" To that end, my work focuses on generating new types of environmental data and making those data comprehensible and available to the public with the goal of catalyzing action to improve the environmental health and wellness of citizens. From data to knowledge to action, my aim is to demonstrate that providing access to environmental information can empower communities to collectively engage with and improve their environmental health and wellness I am an Assistant Professor at Indiana University's School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering. My research explores strategies that make cities more sustainable and resilient in the face of climate change and other environmental challenges. With my design background, I bring a spatial perspective to analyzing environmental data and develop creative solutions to environmental challenges. My strength as a researcher is in the ability to work across multiple disciplines, from climate science to public health to design to public policy, in order to develop and evaluate innovative solutions to complex environmental problems facing our cities and communities. I have conducted CDC, NSF, EPA, and non-profit supported research in climate change, public health, and urban food systems. My current research focuses on making environmental data visible, accessible, and understandable to local communities with the goal of empowering residents to take ownership of their environment, their community, and their environmental health.
