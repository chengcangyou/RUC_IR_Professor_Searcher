I thus won't be on campus reliably and will not be holding office hours. We do plan for CS 167 to be taught in the spring of 2026, probably by Prof. Lenore Cowen. If you need to contact me for another purpose, I can be reached through my Tufts email address. Senior advisees: If you are looking to collect my signature on your graduation paperwork, click here for departmental instructions. TL;DR: I don't need to sign, but what you do need to do varies by program and school, so check the link for details.
