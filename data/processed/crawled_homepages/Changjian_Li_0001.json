I am also a member of ELLIS – the European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems. My research focuses on Computer Graphics and Computer Vision, particularly in the areas of 3D Generation and Analysis. This includes, but is not limited to, sketch-based 3D modeling, CAD modeling, 3D animation, video generation, and point cloud processing. I am also actively exploring interdisciplinary applications, such as medical image processing and modeling. Before joining University of Edinburgh, I worked at Inria as a Starting Researcher working with Dr. Adrien Bousseau and did my postdoc in the Smart Geometry Processing Group at University College London (UCL) working with Prof. Niloy Mitra. I got my Ph.D. degree from the University of Hong Kong in 2019 supervised by Prof. Wenping Wang and got my Bachelor degree from Shandong University in 2014. During my PhD, I interned at MSRA and had the privilege of working with Prof. Hao Pan. Our collaboration has continued ever since. Accepting Students: I am looking for highly motivated students, feel free to drop me an email with your CV. There are plenty of PhD scholarships available within School of Informatics and the whole Europe, see below: • ELLIS PhD Program: call for application • Graduate School Scholarship: call for application • CDT-D2AIR: call for application • CDT-MLSystem: call for application • CDT-AI4BIO:call for application News • 10/24, 2025: Congratulations to Lei Zhong for receiving the Google PhD Fellow 2025!
