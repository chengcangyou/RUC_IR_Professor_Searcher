My research interest is software security, especially program analysis on binary code, software obfuscation/de-obfuscation, malware analysis, program similarity analysis, and model checking. Before joining UNH, I obtained my Ph.D. from the Pennsylvania State University. I received my master's degree at University of Science and Technology of China and bachelor's degree at Jilin University.
