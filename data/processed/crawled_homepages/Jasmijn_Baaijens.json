She develops algorithms and software for reconstruction of microbial genomes from sequencing data, and applies these methods to characterize pathogen diversity in patient or community samples. After completing her MSc degree in mathematics, Jasmijn was drawn to the field of bioinformatics for her PhD research in viral genomics at the Dutch institute for mathematics and computer science (CWI). She then extended her expertise to bacterial genomics as a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard Medical School. Jasmijn joined the Bioinformatics Lab at TU Delft in September 2021 as an assistant professor, and she is excited to collaborate with theoretical and experimental research groups interested in microbial genomics and pathogen surveillance.
