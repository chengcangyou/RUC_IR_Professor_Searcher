In the theoretical side, my work has used tools from probability to assess the effectiveness of certain convex optimization algorithms. The problems I study originate from consideration of real world applications. As such, they motivate the construction of a mathematical model and the design of algorithms that could handle noisy/incomplete data. A common thread in my research is a theoretical analysis of convex approximations and a principled design of algorithms for possibly large scale problems.Some of my research topics are:1. Algorithms for the distance geometry problem with the goal of determining 3D protein structure2. Fast convex algorithms for the graph matching problem3. Theoretical analysis of deep learning in certain applications.",
