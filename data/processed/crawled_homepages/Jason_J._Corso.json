If you receive an email that purports to be from me---yet fails to actually originate from the umich.edu domain---and says there is a need to hire you for something like $400 per week, it's fraud. This email will ask you to text some number (not mine) with your details. It's fraud. Stop. Do not pass Go. Do not do what the email says. Immediately forward that email to reportphish@umich.edu. I will never personally post a job announcement; no faculty would ever have you then text them. It's ridiculous.

Corso is currently a Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science at The Johns Hopkins University in 2005. He is a recipient of the NSF CAREER award (2009), ARO Young Investigator award (2010), Google Faculty Research Award (2015) and on the DARPA CSSG. He is also the Co-Founder and CEO of Voxel51, a computer vision tech startup that is building the state of the art platform for video and image based applications. His main research thrust is high-level computer vision and its relationship to human language, robotics and data science. He primarily focuses on problems in video understanding such as video segmentation, activity recognition, and video-to-text. From biomedicine to recreational video, imaging data is ubiquitous. Yet, imaging scientists and intelligence analysts are without an adequate language and set of tools to fully tap the information-rich image and video. He works to provide such a language; specifically, he primarily studies the coupled problems of segmentation and recognition from a Bayesian perspective emphasizing the role of statistical models in efficient visual inference. His long-term goal is a comprehensive and robust methodology of automatically mining, quantifying, and generalizing information in large sets of projective and volumetric images and video.
