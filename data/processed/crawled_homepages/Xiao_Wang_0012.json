My research interests broadly cover computer security, privacy, and cryptography. Recently, I’ve been working on practical multi-party computation, zero-knowledge proof, and lattice-based cryptography, as well as their applications in machine learning, databases, formal methods, health informatics, and the legal domain. I like building real systems based on advanced cryptographic techniques and pushing their limits of practicality.Fun-Time Photo",
