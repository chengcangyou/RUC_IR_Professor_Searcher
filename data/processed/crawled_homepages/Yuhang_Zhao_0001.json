My research interests include Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), accessibility, augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), and AI-powered interactive systems. I design and build intelligent interactive systems to enhance human abilities. Via my research, I seek to understand the challenges and needs of people with diverse abilities, and design systems and interaction techniques to empower them in real life activities as well as the emerging virtual worlds. I received my Ph.D. degree from Cornell Tech, Cornell University, and B.E. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from Tsinghua University. NEWS Feb 19, 2025 Our lab has three papers accepted to CHI 2025! Congratulations to my students Ruijia Chen who worked on VisiMark, an AR sysetm that augments landmarks for low vision people in indoor navigation, Kexin Zhang who worked on creating inclusive avatar design guidelines for people with disabilities, and Kassie Povinelli and Hazel Zhu who worked on understanding the goal exploration process in gender-affirming voice training. Feb 14, 2025 Glad to receive the Grant Accelerator Program (GAP) Award from the McPherson Eye Research Institute to work on intent-aware visual augmentation systems for people with low vision! Nov 27, 2024 We will be hosting the first AI-assisted Vision Mini-Workshop to discuss the opportunities, challenges, and collaborations on suitable AI-powered assistive technology for the blind and low vision communities. Nov 25, 2024 Invited to give a talk on AI-assisted Vision: Context-Aware Systems to Empower People with Low Vision at the CS seminar at the University of Rochester Oct 13, 2024 Our paper CookAR received the Belonging & Inclusion Best Paper Award at UIST 2024. Sep 12, 2024 We received an NIH Smart Connected Health (R01) award to work on scene-aware AR systems to support people with low vision in activities of daily living. The project is in collaboration with Prof. Yapeng Tian from the University of Texas at Dallas, Prof. Jon E. Froehlich from the University of Washington, and Dr. Sanbrita Mondal from the Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Jan 18, 2024 My Students Ru Wang and Daniel Killough have their work on GazePrompt—a gaze-aware reading system for low vision users—accepted to CHI 2024! Jan 18, 2024 My students Kexin Zhang and Ruijia Chen’s research on exploring the design space of AR head-mounted displays for first responders accepted to CHI 2024! Dec 16, 2023 Kassie Povinelli’s work on voice changers in social VR for transgender users is accepted to IEEE VR 2024!!! Sep 07, 2023 My research, collaborated with Prof. Yaxing Yao, on social VR inclusion and safety for people with disabilities is funded by NSF. RECENT TALKS",
