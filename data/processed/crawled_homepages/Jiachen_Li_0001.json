I am the Director of Trustworthy Autonomous Systems Laboratory (TASL) and a core faculty of the Center for Robotics and Intelligent Systems (CRIS), UC Riverside Artificial Intelligence Research and Education Institute (RAISE), and the Center for Environmental Research and Technology. Before joining UCR, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at Stanford University working with Prof. Mykel J. Kochenderfer at Stanford Intelligent Systems Laboratory (SISL), Stanford Center for AI Safety, and Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL). I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the University of California, Berkeley working with Prof. Masayoshi Tomizuka at Mechanical Systems Control Laboratory, Berkeley AI Research (BAIR), and Berkeley DeepDrive (BDD). I have interned at Waymo, Toyota Research Institute, and Honda Research Institute. Attention! I am actively looking for multiple highly motivated Ph.D. students (fully funded, starting in Fall 2026), master students, undergraduate students, and research interns to join my lab. If you are interested, please follow the application instructions HERE. Please feel free to send me an email if any questions. My Lab Website: HERE E-mail: jiachen.li AT ucr.edu UC Riverside Profile: HERE Google Scholar: HERE LinkedIn: HERE Twitter: HERE Research Interest My research interest lies in the broad intersection of robotics, trustworthy AI & ML, reinforcement learning, control, and computer vision and their applications to intelligent autonomous systems (e.g., autonomous vehicles, mobile robots, drones, cyber-physical systems). I am particularly interested in human-robot interactions and multi-agent systems. Please refer to my lab website for more details about our recent research! I am open to research discussion and collaboration, please feel free to get in touch! News Please check my lab website for the latest news about myself and my lab!
