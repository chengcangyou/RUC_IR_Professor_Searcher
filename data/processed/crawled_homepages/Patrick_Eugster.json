I'm a full professor at USI where I lead the Software Systems (SWYSTEMS) group. SWYSTEMS is part of USI's Computer Systems Institute, of which I am a founding member and current director. Prior to that I was a regular faculty member at Purdue University (2005 - 2016) and TU Darmstadt (2014 - 2017). I have also been a visiting faculty member at MIT (2012/2013). Throughout the years I had the pleasure to collaborate with, and receive support from, several corporate partners including Amazon, Cisco, Facebook, Google, HP, IBM, NetApp, and SAP. I'm interested in various aspects of distributed software systems. Distribution is here to stay as it is a choice often made consciously to address limitations of single computers (e.g., to parallelize computations), but, more importantly, it is frequently a given with applications allowing humans to interact directly or indirectly through respective devices. Challenges arise from the need of achieving efficiency without forfeiting consistency in corresponding applications, in the presence of failures and security threats.
