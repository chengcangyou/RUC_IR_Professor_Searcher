The proof, the whole proof, and nothing but the proof! Sapere aude! (\"Dare to know!\") Observations: The Peter Principle: Employees tend to rise to their level of incompetence. The Vardi Amendment: But when managers reach their level of incompetence, they are simply promoted to a higher level in a different organization, as this is the easiest way to get rid of them. Theory and Practice: What is the difference between theory and practice? In theory, not much, but, in practice, quite a lot. Murphy's Law: If anything can go wrong, it will! The Vardi Amendment: Anything that human beings can do, someone will do! Vardi's Principle of Emotional Intelligence : People are fully responsible for their own emotions, but that does not give you permission to be inconsiderate of their emotions. Moshe Y. Vardi Moshe Y. Vardi is faculty member at Rice University. He is a University Professor, the Karen Ostrum George Distinguished Service Professor in Computational Engineering at Rice University, a Professor of Computer Science, a member of the Ken Kennedy Institute for Information Technology, and a Fellow for Science and Technology Policy at the Baker Institute for Public Policy. At Rice, he is leading an Initiative on Technology, Culture, and Society. His research interests focus on automated reasoning, a branch of Artificial Intelligence with broad applications to computer science, including machine learning, database theory, computational-complexity theory, knowledge in multi-agent systems, computer-aided verification, and teaching logic across the curriculum.
