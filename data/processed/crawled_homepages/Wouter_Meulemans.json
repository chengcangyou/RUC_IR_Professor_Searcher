Box 513 5600MB Eindhoven The Netherlands I'm an assistant professor in the Algorithms cluster at TU Eindhoven, with research broadly captured as algorithmic visualization. Research interests My research revolves around the intersection of algorithms and information visualization. That is, to study how we can automatically compute high-quality visualizations of data. My research therefore applies methods and techniques from algorithms, computational geometry and graph drawing in the areas of information visualization, automated cartography and geographic information science. My focus within this intersection lies with designing and optimizing objective measures of visualization quality. This measured approach I use to study how we can best compute visualizations of high quality, low visual complexity or that make a trade-off between various aspects. Showcasing such aspects, a central theme throughout my research is schematic geovisualizations. In such schematizations, the data is not made to fit the (geo)spatial dimension, but rather the other way around. That is, space is seen as a deformable tool that we can use to give focus, provide context and highlight structures of the data.
