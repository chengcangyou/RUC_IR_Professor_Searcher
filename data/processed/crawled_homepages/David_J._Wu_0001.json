In Fall 2025, I will be teaching an undergraduate course on cryptography (CS 346: Cryptography). Previously, I was an assistant professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of Virginia (UVA). I received my PhD in computer science at Stanford University in 2018, where I was advised by Dan Boneh. I received my MS and BS in computer science from Stanford University in 2013. My research interests are in cryptography and computer security. My work has been generously supported by a Sloan Research Fellowship (2025), an Amazon Research Award (2025), a Google Research Scholar Award (2022), a Microsoft Research Faculty Fellowship (2021), and an NSF CAREER Award (2021).
