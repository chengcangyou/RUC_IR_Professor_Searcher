I was a Postdoctoral Scholar in Stan Leibler's group group in 1998-1999 (when he was at Princeton University). I was a graduate student in John Hopfield's group from 1994-1998 (when he was at Caltech) and in Al Barr's group from 1992-1994 at Caltech. As a graduate student, I also spent time in John Abelson's lab (at Caltech) and in Ned Seeman's lab (at NYU), and I collaborated with Len Adleman (at USC). Hence: ---(old defunct molecular computation pages)--- and: ---(old SIRDS page)---. From 1991-1992, I worked with Stephen Wolfram and Matthew Cook. I was an undergraduate at the University of Chicago from 1987-1991, during which time I spent half a year doing math in Budapest. I went to Evanston Township High School and the best math summer camp ever. First science teacher: Dad. His 1964 essay on \"The Scientist as Poet\". A nice essay about going to grad school that quotes my dad at the end. Artistic Activities Sometime I shall see the world, my first poem, age 8, although I was trying to write a rock song. Now with DALL-E illustrations. God Music, a short story that I wrote back around 1990, inspired by Arthur C Clarke's 1957 short story Ultimate Melody. Collaboration with an exceptional painter: Ann Erpino. A Carpet of Algorithms, a whimsical play about a visit to a scientific museum, with illustrations related to our paper. She Dreams of Molecules, a poem for my wife on the occasion of her tenure, with DALL-E illustrations. (Chinese) The Rain in Seattle, a poem for my mother and step-father on the occasion of their 40th anniversary, with DALL-E illustrations. Coming of Age Ceremony of the Dream Siblings, a poem with DALL-E illustrations. (HTML) An Incompleteness Theorem, a drunken poem and DALL-E illustration. Now What? Three Worlds, a poem for John Hopfield on the occasion of his receiving the Nobel Prize, with DALL-E illustrations. My collected poetry in plain text. State of mind, Memory, Nico's song, Hold on change, Don't no one know why, and Faultline, my brother's songs with my DALL-E powered videos. My own songs as performed by Suno AI. Family The love of my life, Lulu Qian. My sister, Rachael Winfree. My father, Art Winfree. My mother, Trish Woollcott. My step-father, Phil Woollcott. My brother, Chris Woollcott. My bonus sisters Johanna Woollcott and Corinne Nassen. My brother-in-law Qing Dong. My uncle Bob Winfree's experience as artist-in-residence for the National Parks in Alaska. He and his wife have an art studio. His son Kyle Winfre. My cousins Kristin Laidre and Mark Laidre. My cousins Carrie Walter and Ingo Walter and Steve Walter.
