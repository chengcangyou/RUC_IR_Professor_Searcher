From January 2016 to August 2017, I served as a Program Director at the National Science Foundation, with responsibilities in the Information Integration and Informatics (III), Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC), and BIGDATA programs. I received my Ph.D. from Texas A&M University in 2006 and my B.S. from Peking University, China in 2001, both in computer science. My research focuses on data analytics and information privacy/security, and is currently supported by National Science Foundation, Army Research Office, and Qatar Foundation. My work has received several awards, including the NSF CAREER award in 2008, Best Paper Awards from IEEE ICC 2013 and IEEE NAS 2010, the Best Student Paper Award from ACM CIKM 2013, and a Best Paper Nomination from IEEE ISI 2015. My work on technology transfer was also recognized by the GW Technology Transfer Innovation Price and the first place finish at the GW Business Plan Competition, both in 2012.
