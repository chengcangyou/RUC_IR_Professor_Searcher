Before that, I was an Assistant Professor in the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University Bloomington from 2021 to 2022, a Hartree Postdoctoral Fellow in the Joint Center for Quantum Information and Computer Science (QuICS) at the University of Maryland from 2020 to 2021, supervised by Dr. Andrew Childs, and a Postdoctoral Fellow at UT Austin from 2018 to 2020, working under the supervision of Dr. Scott Aaronson. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering at Penn State University, where I was fortunate to have Dr. Sean Hallgren as my advisor. I received my Bachelor's degree from National Taiwan University. My research interests include quantum algorithms, quantum complexity, and quantum cryptography. I am devoted to understanding quantum computing's capabilities, limits, and how it could change computer science. Most of my research is focusing on dealing with the following two questions: First, which computational tasks can have quantum advantages, and what are the limits and minimum quantum resources for quantum advantages on these problems? Second, how does quantum computing change the landscape of computer science?Outside academics, I love playing various sports, including baseball, soccer, badminton, basketball, swimming, etc. Well, I am certainly not good at all of them. I joined the soccer team and softball team in college and had wonderful memories with my teammates. Besides, I enjoy cooking, reading history, and listening to music or radio.     \"We are trying to prove ourselves wrong as quickly as possible because only in that way we can find progress.\" - Richard FeynmanHiringI’m seeking highly motivated PhD students for Fall 2026 in quantum computing theory, with particular interest in quantum complexity theory and quantum cryptography.News! [11/2025] Our work Adversarially robust quantum state learning has been accepted as a contributed talk at QIP2026[11/2025] Our work A Catalyst Framework for the Quantum Linear System Problem via the Proximal Point Algorithm has been accepted as an oracle presentation in AAAI2026[7/2025] Our work Adversarially robust quantum state learning has been accepted to FOCS2025[6/2025] Our work Quantum State Learning Implies Circuit Lower Bounds has been accepted to COLT2025[4/2025] I am serving on the PC of ISAAC2025.  Look forward to seeing your amazing works in theory of computer science![5/2024] Our work Quantum State Learning Implies Circuit Lower Bounds has been accepted to TQC2024[5/2024] I am serving on the PC of Asiacrypt 2024.
