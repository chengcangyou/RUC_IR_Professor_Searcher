Paper Overview: Classifying Driver Workload Using Physiological and Driving Performance Data: Two Field Studies Paper Overview: Dynamic Difficulty Using Brain Metrics of Workload Erin T. Solovey, Ph.D. Dr. Erin Solovey is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute and was a 2024-25 Harvard-Radcliffe Institute Fellow at Harvard University. She studies human-computer interaction and human-AI interaction, exploring how people and intelligent systems can work together in both high-stakes and everyday environments in ways that are natural, empowering, and aligned with human goals and values. In her lab, Dr. Solovey and her students develop advanced interactive systems that help people think, learn, and work more effectively. To achieve this, they create new ways for people to engage with technology through emerging input technologies, including brain-computer interfaces, physiological and textile sensing, and radar-based input, and combine these with machine learning to create intelligent, adaptive systems. These systems address real-world challenges in education, accessibility, teamwork, decision-making, and safety-critical environments. Dr. Solovey is also deeply committed to improving STEM education and increasing participation in computing and AI. Dr. Solovey received her bachelor’s degree in computer science from Harvard College and her MS and PhD in computer science from Tufts University. She was a postdoctoral fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the Humans and Automation Laboratory and CSAIL. She served as the deputy editor of the International Journal of Human-Computer Studies from 2019-2024 and currently serves as an associate editor for ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction. She also regularly serves on such program committees as the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI) and was appointed to the National Academies Panel on Assessment of Humans in Complex Systems. Her research is funded by the National Science Foundation, and she has received several awards, including a Computing Innovation Fellowship, a Best Paper Award, and five Best Paper Honorable Mention Awards. Her work has been covered on WBZ CBS News, Worcester's Channel 3 News, in MIT Technology Review, Slashdot, Engadget, The Times and others. She also has conducted research at MIT Lincoln Laboratory and Microsoft Research. Previously, she was a software engineer at Oracle, and also has experience at several startups. NEWS & UPDATES November, 2025: On The WPI Podcast, I had the chance to talk about “thinking with AI,” a vision for building a more human-centered technology that works with us, not just for us; and that sees AI as more than a tool to automate tasks, but as a partner in helping us make better decisions.
