I am also a member of the Security and Privacy group in Informatics. I lead the Principles of Provenance group. From September 2018 to September 2023 I was a Turing Fellow and from 2018-2020 I was a Visiting Researcher at King's College, London. From October 2008 until December 2016 I held a Royal Society University Research Fellowship. From September 2004 until October 2008 I was a postdoctoral research associate in the Database Group. I have also been involved with the Digital Curation Centre and during 2008-2009 I organized a Theme Program on Principles of Provenance for the eScience Institute. I earned my PhD in Computer Science at Cornell University in August 2004. From January to May 2003 I visited Cambridge University's Computer Laboratory. In the summer of 2001 I worked at Intertrust on a summer internship. I have a BS in Computer Science and Mathematics (May 1998) and MS in Mathematics (August 1998) from Carnegie Mellon University. Before that I lived in Wisconsin, land of cheese. I maintain a research blog, which is updated sporadically. PhD opportunities: Right now I am open to supervising new students, but do not have funding at my immediate disposal. Please get in touch if you are interested in PhD study.
