Suen BiographyResearch areas Handwriting recognition Computer analysis and recognition of documents Detection of fake coins Design of license plates for automobiles Human personality Facial Beauty Dr. Ching Y. Suen is the Founder and Co-Director of CENPARMI and the Concordia Honorary Chair on AI & Pattern Recognition. He received his Ph.D. degree from UBC Vancouver) and his Master's degree from the University of Hong Kong. He has served as the Chairman of the Department of Computer Science and as the Associate Dean (Research) of the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science of Concordia University. He is the chief architect and donor of the CENPARMI Scholarship of Concordia. Prof. Suen has served at numerous national and international professional societies as President, Vice-President, Governor, and Director. He has given 45 invited/keynote and 300 regular papers at conferences and 200 invited talks at various industries and academic institutions around the world. He has been the Principal Investigator or Consultant of 30 industrial projects. His research projects have been funded by the ENCS Faculty and the Distinguished Chair Programs at Concordia University, FCAR (Quebec), NSERC (Canada), the National Networks of Centres of Excellence (Canada), the Canadian Foundation for Innovation, and the industrial sectors in various countries, including Canada, France, Japan, Italy, and the United States. Dr. Suen has published 8 conference proceedings, 16 books and more than 620 papers, and many of them have been widely cited while the ideas in others have been applied in practical environments involving handwriting recognition, thinning methodologies, font analysis and multiple classifiers. Dr. Suen is the recipient of numerous awards, including  IAPR 2020 King-Sun Fu Prize (highest honour in the field of Pattern Recognition, for pioneering research and exceptional contributions to handwriting recognition and document understanding in theory, practice, and education; enabling hundreds of millions of cell phone users to enter handwritten characters on the surface of cell phones), Elsevier Pattern Recognition Journal Award of Excellence (2016), Gold Medal from the University of Bari (Italy 2012), the IAPR ICDAR Award (2005), the ITAC/NSERC national award ($50,000 in 1992), and the \"Concordia Lifetime Research Achievement\" and \"Concordia Fellow\" awards (2008 and 1998 respectively), and the \"Teaching Excellence Award\" given by the Concordia Council of Student Life in 1995. Prof. Suen has supervised 130 doctoral and master's students to completion, and guided/hosted 100 long-term visiting scientists and professors. He is a fellow of the IEEE (since 1986), IAPR (1994), and the Academy of Sciences of the Royal Society of Canada (1995). Currently, he is the Emeritus Editor-in-Chief of the journal of Pattern Recognition, an Adviser or Associate Editor of 5 other journals, and Editor of a new book series on Language Processing and Pattern Recognition. Actually he has held previous positions as Editor-in-Chief, or Associate Editor or Adviser of 6 other journals. He is not only the founder of four conferences: ICDAR, IWFHR/ICFHR, ICPRAI, and VI, but has also organized more than 12 international conferences including ICPR, ICDAR, ICFHR, ICPRAI, ICCPOL, and as Honorary Chair of numerous international conferences. In 1997, he created the IAPR ICDAR Awards, to honour both young and established outstanding researchers in the field of Document Analysis and Recognition. He has always been fascinated by letters and characters, ever since he started his doctoral research on teaching the computer to read multi-font documents with a voice output for the blind.
