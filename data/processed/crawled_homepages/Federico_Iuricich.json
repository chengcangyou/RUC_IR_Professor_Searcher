I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Genova, Italy. From September 2014 to June 2016 I have been a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Maryland, at College Park. In July 2016 I joined the Geographical Sciences Department as a research fellow working in the Center for Geospatial Information Science focusing in geospatial data analysis and visualization. From January 2018 to July 2018 I have been a visiting researcher at Queens College (City University of New York), working with Dr. Chao Chen at the intersection of machine learning and topological data analysis. I direct the DataVis Lab where, together with my students, we focus on: Data visualization - scalar field and multivariate data analysis Topological Data Analysis - discrete Morse theory, persistent homology, multidimensional persistence Data structures - multiresolution models, simplicial complexes, spatial indexes For a complete and updated list of our work check out our group webpage",
