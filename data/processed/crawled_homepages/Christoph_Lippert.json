Innovative use of data promises to revolutionize clinical practice and to turn medicine into a data science. In the research group “Digital Health – Machine Learning”, headed by Christoph Lippert, we work on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence algorithms and novel applications in medicine. We develop models to detect disease patterns in images and molecular data and statistical models for the quantitative analysis of large cohorts.
