Current Courses (Fall 2025) CS558 Programming Languages Upcoming Courses (Winter 2026) CS410/510 Essentials of Compilation Brief Biography My research interests are in programming languages, verification, compilers, tools, and applications, with a focus on high-assurance software environments. I am currently investigating the use of metadata tagging mechanisms to perform security monitoring. My past publications, mostly about functional languages, include work on debugger implementation, garbage collection, compilation, integration with logic languages, and lazy functional algorithms. I teach courses in programming languages, compilers, semantics, and theorem proving.
