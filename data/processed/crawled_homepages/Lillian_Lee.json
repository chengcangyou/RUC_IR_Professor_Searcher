Cornell 1993, math and CS; Ph.D. Harvard 1997. The crudest curriculum vitae crows and flaps its wings in a style peculiar to the undersigner. I doubt whether you can even give your telephone number without giving something of yourself. –Nabokov, Nikolai Gogol Research, professional activities, and recognition Research summary Groups: my students :: NLP :: machine learning :: AI Papers: includes links to associated talk slides, data, etc. Other talk slides Awards, press, offices, editorial boards, outreach, etc. Interested in doing research with me or other NLP faculty? Cornell undergraduate/MEng/MS students seeking research/project positions: due to sabbatical, I'm afraid I have no new positions open until at least Fall 2026. Other resources: the ACSU's guide on how to find a research position (you'll need to click on the \"Research\" tab), the Bowers CIS page on undergrad research, ACSU's semesterly Research Night, the Psych department's internships google group (you'll need to request permission to join), CRA site on research opportunities Prospective graduate students: I'm really sorry to not be able to respond to individual inquiries, because I'm trying to devote as much time as I can to my current Cornell students. But please don't take my lack of response as lack of interest! I've had to settle on a blanket policy of not answering any such emails — but I do try to read them all. Cornell-external students seeking internships/visiting positions/committee membership and people inquiring after postdocs: I don't have any visiting research positions available any time from to summer 2026 inclusive, and I am unable to join any external thesis committees for the foreseeable future, due to my commitments to my current students. I am sorry, and I realize that this situation means that I am missing out on the opportunity to work with some fantastic people. My policies regarding requests for tenure/promotion letters (undergrads/masters/PhD students: to be clear, this section does not apply to you!) I decline requests from institutions that do not offer strong confidentiality promises, so as to feel more empowered to be candid in my letters. I decline requests for \"third-year review\"-like letters, meaning those that are for promotion but without tenure. Reason: to reserve sufficient time for letters regarding tenure cases. I would strongly prefer that candidates not contact me beforehand regarding my availability to write a letter, and reserve the right not to answer such queries. I understand this can put candidates in an awkward position when they are advised to make such pre-contacts by their institution, and I am sorry for that; I'm providing this public statement as protection for candidates in that case. But I would prefer to be able to state, should/as I write such letters, that I was not contacted by the candidate or did not promise the candidate anything, so as to provide more evidence of impartiality. Contact and availability info I am on sabbatical for academic year 2025-2026. I would like to take a break from Cornell business during this time, focusing on research instead.
