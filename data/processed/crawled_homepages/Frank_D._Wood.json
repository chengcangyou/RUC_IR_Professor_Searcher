I direct the Pacific Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence (PLAI) research group. I also am a founder of Inverted AI, a PLAI group spin-out focused on advanced simulation technology for the autonomous vehicle industry. I also lead the plaicraft.ai emodied AI research project. fwood@cs.ubc.ca Follow @frankdonaldwood I encourage visitors to check out both the PLAI research BLOG and the Inverted AI research BLOG for more information about research being conducted under my supervision. Research Interests My primary research areas include deep generative modeling, amortized inference, probabilistic programming, reinforcement learning, and applied probabilistic machine learning. My research interests range from the development of new probabilistic models and inference algorithms to real-world applications. My research contributions include probabilistic programming systems, new models and inference algorithms, and novel applications of such models to problems in autonomous driving, computational neuroscience, vision, natural language processing, robotics, and reinforcement learning.

Please visit the departmental web page for prospective students to apply. An excellent strategy for getting an offer to work with me is to propose research in your proposal that extends and explicitly cites recent work of my own. Better still, working with me beforehand is a major leg up. Direct email to me about becoming a student at UBC is unlikely to get a reply. Postdocs I am constantly looking for postdocs with strong programming languages, statistics, and applied machine learning skills. Please contact me directly including a brief (one paragraph or so) proposed research plan related to my recent research and funding (see my CV for current funding details). Contact without research plans is unlikely to get a reply. Entrepreneurs The intersection of Canada, British Columbia, Vancouver, and UBC is an amazingly interesting place to start a technology company. Contact me directly if you are interested in maintaining an academic affiliation while starting, while sitting beside a world-class machine learning team, a machine learning startup in Vancouver. Please familiarize yourself with MITACS Accelerate and explain where you will source initial investment in the first email. Contact without concrete and attainable funding plans is unlikely to get a reply. Highlights I was one of the initial developers of the Anglican probabilistic programming language and am a co-author of one of the first book length treatments of probabilistic programming, a pre-print of which is on arXiv.
