I also supervise computer science students in internship positions and students doing client based final year project Currently I am a board member of the Irish Platform for Patient Organisations, Science and Industry (IPPOSI). My current Research interests concern citizen and public engagement to capture and analyse citizen and public informed preferences for sharing and accessing health information. Novel research dissemination and engagement processes e.g. citizen Think-ins and Citizen Juries, are important to inform design of scalable EHR information models. These models are needed to represent interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary viewpoints and need to integrate with legacy as well as nascent technologies embedded in the complex world of healthcare. My strategy of working is a patient/citizen centered one as it is the patient/citizen who is in the unique position to view integration of their health information.
