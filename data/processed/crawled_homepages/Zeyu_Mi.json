I obtained my Ph.D. in computer science from SJTU, advised by Prof. Haibo Chen and Prof. Binyu Zang. My research interests include LLM systems, operating systems, and system virtualization. I obtained my bachelor degree in software engineering from Nanjing University. We are currently developing the next generation of edge-side large language model training, inference, and intelligent agent systems. If you are self-motivated and very eager to make an impact on the world through these systems, please feel free to email me. I will offer internship opportunities to you!
