I work on algorithm design and complexity theory, and I especially like using algebraic tools to solve problems throughout computer science. I was previously a Rabin Postdoc in Theoretical Computer Science at Harvard. Before that, I completed my PhD in Computer Science at MIT, advised by Ryan Williams and Virginia Vassilevska Williams. I spent the first half of grad school at Stanford until I moved to MIT with my advisors. I am happy to work with some fantastic PhD students at Columbia: Hantao Yu Sayak Chakrabarti Yizhi Huang Baitian Li My student(s) who have graduated: Kevin Yeo (now at Google NYC)",
