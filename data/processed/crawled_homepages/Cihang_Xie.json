My research interest lies at the intersection of computer vision and machine learning, with the goal of building human-level computer vision systems. I am particularly interested in securing model performance under distribution shifts, and developing deep representation learning with minimal supervision. I received my Ph.D. degree from Johns Hopkins University, advised by Bloomberg Distinguished Professor Alan Yuille. I have worked as a research intern with Kaiming He and Laurens van der Maaten at the Facebook AI Research (FAIR); Quoc Le at the Google Brain. I receive the 2020 Facebook Fellowship. To check the latest updates of my research, please visit our group page. Follow @cihangxie Hiring: I am co-leading the Vision · Learning · Assured Autonomy (VLAA) Lab with Professor Yuyin Zhou. Our lab has multiple openings for summer interns and visiting students with flexible starting times. If you are interested in these opportunities, please complete this form. Recent News [NEW] We release Recap-DataComp-1B, where we use a LLaMA-3-powered LLaVA model to recaption the entire 1.3 billion images from DataComp-1B. Our Recap-DataComp-1B shows higher textual quality, and can help to train stronger CLIP models and T2I models. [July 2024] Three papers are accepted by ECCV 2024. [May 2024] Congratulations to Xianhang Li on winning the Jack Baskin & Peggy Downes-Baskin Fellowship. Additionally, D-iGPT is accepted by ICML 2024 --- our strongest model secures an ImageNet top-1 accuracy of 90.0% with ViT-H. [April 2024] We release HQ-Edit, a dataset with high-resolution images & detailed and aligned editing instructions. Our fine-tuned InstructPix2Pix delivers superior editing performance. Additionally, two papers are accepted by TMLR. [March 2024] One paper is accepted by NAACL 2024, and one paper is accepted by TMLR. [February 2024] Three papers (AdvXL, MixCon3D, L2B) are accepted by CVPR 2024. [January 2024] Our Tuning LayerNorm in Attention is accepted by ICLR 2024 as a spotlight paper; our visual probing is accpted by EACL 2024. [NEW] Congratulations to Zijun and the team on winning the 2nd place in both the base model subtrack and the large model subtrack, Red Teaming Track, in NeurIPS 2023 Trojan Detection Challenge. We will release the code and the report soon. [December 2023] One paper is accepted by TMLR. Additionally, we release D-iGPT, which attains 89.5% ImageNet top-1 accuracy with ViT-L. Larger models are coming! [November 2023] CLIPA-v2 is accepted by NeurIPS 2023 R0-FoMo Workshop, and Sight Beyond Text is accepted by NeurIPS 2023 Instruction Workshop. [October 2023] Congratulations to Siwei and the team on winning the 2nd place in Task 4: Brain Metastases Segmentation of MICCAI 2023 BraTS Challenge. [September 2023] CLIPA is accepted by NeurIPS 2023. In addition, we release our best model, CLIPA-G/14, which attains 83.0% zero-shot ImageNet top-1 accuracy. [NEW] We release CLIPA, which enables CLIP training with limited computational resources. Furthermore, at a low cost of just $15,000, our CLIPA-v2 effectively elevates the zero-shot ImageNet top-1 accuracy to an impressive 81.8%. [July 2023] Three papers are accepted by ICCV 2023. [June 2023] Two papers are accepted by MICCAI 2023. [February 2023] DMAE is accepted by CVPR 2023. [January 2023] Two papers are accepted by ICLR 2023.
