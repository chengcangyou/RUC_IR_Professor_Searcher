My broad research area is software engineering, and my specific interests include formal software design modeling and analysis, software economics, software evolution and modularity. The questions that motivated my research include: how to design software that enable hundreds of developers to work collaboratively, concurrently, and independently from each other? how to make sure that modules in a software system can evolve independently? Does it worthwhile to refactor? How to detect software quality problems that incur tremendous maintenance cost but are not detectible using traditional V&V methods, such as extra dependencies and technical debts? I received my Ph.D. and M.S degrees in Computer Science from the University of Virginia in 2006 and 2002 respectively, advised by Professor Kevin Sullivan. I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Xidian University in 1996, advised by Professor Gong. Before I came to the US in 2000, I worked for North China Institute of Computing Technology, one of the top computer research institutions in China.
