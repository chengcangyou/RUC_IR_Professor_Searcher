Staff details Position Lecturer in Creative Computing Department Computing Email a.lomas (@gold.ac.uk) Website www.andylomas.com Andy Lomas is a computational artist, mathematician, Emmy award winning supervisor of computer generated effects, and lecturer in Creative Computing at Goldsmiths. His art work explores how the complex nature of form can be created emergently by simulating growth processes. He has exhibited internationally, including at the Pompidou Centre, V&A, Royal Society, Science Museum, SIGGRAPH, Japan Media Arts Festival, Ars Electronica Festival, Kinetica, Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery, Los Angeles Center for Digital Art, Centro Andaluz de Arte Contemporaneo, Watermans, and the ZKM. His work is in the collections at the V&A, the Computer Arts Society and the D'Arcy Thompson Art Fund Collection. In 2014 his work Cellular Forms won The Lumen Prize Gold Award. Production credits include Walking With Dinosaurs, Avatar, Matrix: Revolutions, Matrix: Reloaded, Over the Hedge and The Tale of Despereaux. He received Emmys for his work on The Odyssey (1997) and Alice in Wonderland (1999). Publications and research outputs Show/ExhibitionMorphogenetic Creations Lomas, Andy ORCID logo . 2016.
