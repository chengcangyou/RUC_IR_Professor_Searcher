Chinwendu Enyioha Assistant Professor of Electrical & Computer Engineering, and Computer Science at University of Central Florida Home Research Publications Teaching Funding Group Members Openings Chinwendu Enyioha Assistant Professor of Electrical & Computer Engineering, and Computer Science at University of Central Florida Home Research Publications Teaching Funding Group Members Openings Home Research Overview My research group conducts basic and applied research in the areas of distributed optimization and control of networked dynamic and cyber-physical systems. Given the growth in the number of connected devices, the need for higher channel capacity for information flow, and critical/integral nature of modern technical system, the overarching research objectives are to develop efficient tools and techniques for decision making in large-scale resource-constrained systems. Application areas include Cyber-physical systems (CPS) such as energy/power systems and multi-robot teams. Research Interests Optimization and control under communication constraints Safety and security in cyber-physical systems Reinforcement learning and AI-based control of networked autonomous systems. Bio Chinwendu Enyioha is an Assistant Professor in the EECS Department at the University of Central Florida (UCF). Prior to arriving UCF, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the EE Department at Harvard University and Tufts University. He completed the Ph.D. in Electrical and Systems Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, supervised by George Pappas and Ali Jadbabaie, in the areas of networked dynamical systems, and cyber-physical systems. At Penn, Dr. Enyioha was affiliated with the GRASP (Robotics) Lab and the PRECISE Center. Before that, he completed the BS in Mathematics (Summa Cum Laude) at Gardner-Webb University (GWU). Dr. Enyioha is a Fellow of the Ford Foundation, was named a William Fontaine Scholar at the University of Pennsylvania and has received the Mathematical Association of America Patterson award, amongst others. His research lies in the areas of optimization and resource-aware control of large-scale systems, with applications to multi-robot systems and cyber-physical networks.",
