Most recently, the focus of the research has been in the application of AI and digital technolpogies in healthcare settings to help reduce clinical burden and improve patient outcomes.  This has included AI applications in computational pathology, medical image analysis in surgery, radiotherapy planning, personal health monitoring in chronic care sysyems and predictive analytics in hospital care. The research adopts a socio-technical perspective and considers the interaction of ML based systems, clinical stakeholders and patients to achieve effective outcomes in a responsible and ethical manner. Beyond healthcare settings, I have broader interests in the future of hybrid work and how AI and digital technology are transforming the landscape of work across a variety of industries.  In particular the research seeks to explore these shifts and their implications by developing new systems that can be evaluated in real world contexts.
