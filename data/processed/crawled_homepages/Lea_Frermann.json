About I am a senior lecturer and DECRA 2023 fellow in natural language processing in the School of Computing and Information Systems, University of Melbourne. My research focusses on understanding how humans learn about and represent complex and evolving information in the context of large-scale and noisy environments; and on using these insights to develop fairer and more robust automatic systems. I combine methods from natural language processing, machine learning and computational cognitive modelling. Representative projects include scalable models of category and feature learning in children from noisy language data; and modeling the historical change of word meaning over centuries. My current research focusses on improving automatic understanding of narratives, both in fiction (e.g., inducing structured representations of novels; or movie summarization) and in reality, by analyzing framing and narrative strategies in (biased) news stories. Before joining Melbourne University, I was a postdoc / applied scientist at Amazon Core AI in Berlin, and before that a research associate in the Edinburgh NLP group , ILCC, University of Edinburgh, working with Mirella Lapata and Shay Cohen.
