It is a quite common German last name, well known for the author and poet Erich KÃ¤stner. The umlaut Ã¤ is relevant for the pronunciation. The valid ASCII spelling is Kaestner, not Kastner. To correctly typeset the name in LaTeX use K{\\\"a}stner. To create the ä in Windows enter 0228 while pressing the ALT key or simply copy it from this page. [close] Associate Professor Â· Carnegie Mellon University Â· Institute for Software Research I am an associate professor in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. My current interests are in software engineering for software systems with ML components (or teaching software engineering to data scientists, \"machine learning in production\"), open-source sustainability, and software-supply-chain security. I am generally interested in understanding the` limits of modularity and complexity caused by variability in software systems, which naturally brings me to questions of quality assurance, interoperability, and feature interactions. My research combines rigorous empirical research with program analysis and tool building.I currently serve as the director of the CMU Software Engineering Ph.D. Program.Profiles: Curriculum vitae, Google Scholar, ACM, dblp, Google+ .

Kaestner, S3D - TCS Hall 430, 4665 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA News  8 Apr. 2025Book releaseThe Machine Learning in Production book is finally out in print (and ebook) format. MIT Press has all the details: 7 Jan. 2025Talk: From Models to Products: On the Role of Software Engineering for Machine LearningI substantially updated my talk pitching better software engineering for building ML products with a focus on quality assurance both at the model and the system level. I originally gave this as a CAIN keynote in 2024 and several times since. Here is a recording of the talk at the University of Paderborn: 15 Jan. 2024Machine Learning in Production Book finished and submitted to publisherOver the last two years, I was writing and refining a book on software engineering for building products with machine learning components, based on our course Machine Learning in Production. I have released as chapters incrementally on Medium. I have finally declared the project as complete and handed over the manuscript to the publisher MIT Press and expect a formal release in about one year. The book remains under a creative commons license and the public (not yet finally copyedited) version of the book is now live at https://mlip-cmu.github.io/book/. Older News...   Research Overview Software Engineering for AI-Enabled Systems We explore how different facets of software engineering change with the introduction of machine learning components in production systems, with an interest in interdisciplinary collaboration, quality assurance, system-level thinking, safety, and better data science tools: Capturing Software Engineering for AI-Enabled Systems Â· Interdisciplinary Collaboration in Engineering AI-Enabled Systems Â· Developer Tooling for Data Scientists Sustainability and Fairness in Open Source We study the dynamics of open source communities with a focus on unstanding and fostering fair and sustainable environments. Primarily with empirical research methods, we explore topics, such as open source culture, coordination, stress and disengagement, funding, and security: Sustainability and Fairness in Open Source Â· Collaboration and Coordination in Open Source Â· Adoption of Practices and Tooling Quality Assurance for Highly-Configurable Software Systems We explore approaches to scale quality assurance strategies, including parsing, type checking, data-flow analysis, and testing, to huge configuration spaces in order to find variability bugs and detect feature interactions: Variational Analysis Â· Analysis of Unpreprocessed C Code Â· Variational Type Checking and Data-Flow Analysis Â· Variational Execution (Testing) Â· Sampling Â· Feature Interactions Â· Variational Specifications Â· Assuring and Understanding Quality Attributes as Performance and Energy Â· Security Maintenance and Implementation of Highly-Configurable Systems We explore a wide range of different variability implementation mechanisms and their tradeoffs; in addition, we explore reverse engineering and refactoring mechanisms for variability and support developers with variability-related maintenance: Reverse Engineering Variability Implementations Â· Feature Flags Â· Feature-Oriented Programming Â· Assessing and Understanding Configuration-Related Complexity Â· Understanding Preprocessor Use Â· Tracking Load-Time Configuration Options Â· Build Systems Â· Modularity and Feature Interactions Working with Imperfect Modularity We explore mechanisms to support developers in scenarios in which traditional modularity mechanisms face challenges; among others, we explore strategies to complement modularity mechanisms with tooling: Virtual Separation of Concerns Â· Awareness for Evolution in Software Ecosystems Â· Conceptual Discussions Variability Mechanisms Beyond Configurable Software Systems We explore how analyses developed for variability can solve problems in contexts beyond software product lines, such as design space exploration, that share facets of the problem such as large finite search spaces with similarities among candidates: Developer Support and Quality Assurance for PHP Â· Sensitivity Analysis Â· Mutation Testing and Program Repair Other Topics We have collaborated on a number of other software engineering and programming languages topics, including dynamic software updates, extensible domain-specific languages, software merging, and various empirical methods topics: Understanding Program Comprehension with fMRI Teaching PRG Paper Reading Group â Seminar Fall 2024 17-445/645 Machine Learning in Production Spring 2024 17-445/645 Machine Learning in Production / 11-695 AI Engineering Fall 2023 17-214 Principles of Software Construction: Objects, Design, and Concurrency Spring 2023 17-445/645 Machine Learning in Production / 11-695 AI Engineering Fall 2022 17-445/645 Machine Learning in Production Spring 2022 17-445/645 Machine Learning in Production / 11-695 AI Engineering See also the full teaching history.   Team Yining Hong (PhD student since 2024)Hao He (PhD student since 2023, coadvised with Bogdan Vasilescu)Yuan Lirong (PhD student since 2023, coadvised with Rohan Padhye)Courtney Miller (PhD student since 2021, coadvised with Bogdan Vasilescu)Chenyang Yang (PhD student since 2021, coadvised with Sherry Tongshuang Wu)Nadia Nahar (PhD student since 2020)Gabriel Ferreira (PhD student since 2014) FormerChu-Pan Wong (PhD 2014-2021, now at Facebook)Shurui Zhou (PhD 2014-2020, now Assistant Professor at University of Toronto)Miguel Velez (PhD 2016-2021, now at GoogleJens Meinicke (visiting scholar, 2014, 2016-2020, now at Google)Pooyan Jamshidi (postdoc 2016-2018, now Assistant Professor at University of South Carolina)Yuan (Cindy) Jiang (M.S. student, 2021)Waqar Ahmad (graduated MSc, 2016)FlÃ¡vio Medeiros (visiting scholar, 2014, now faculty at Federal Institute of Alagoas)Ètefan StÄnciulescu (visiting scholar, 2016-2017, now researcher at ABB)Kattiana Constantino (visiting scholar 2018-2019)Eduardo Figueiredo (visiting scholar, 2017-2018)Raman Goyal (visiting scholar, 2015, now at Epic)Htut Khine Htay Win (REU student, 2015)Prasad Kawthekar (visiting scholar, 2016, now graduate student at Stanford)Stefan MÃ¼hlbauer (visiting scholar, 2016, now PhD student at University of Weimar)Kyle McDonell (REU student, 2016)Xia Xiao (REU student, 2016)Jean Melo (visiting scholar, 2016-2017, now at Configit)Asher Trockman (REU student, 2017, now PhD student at CMU)Lukas Lazarek (REU student, 2017, now PhD student at Northwestern)Changming Xu (REU student, 2017)Hannah Reiling (REU student, 2017)Larissa Rocha Soares (visiting scholar, 2017-2018)Luyao Ren (REU student, 2018)Leo Chen (REU student, 2018, now PhD student at CMU)Kalil Garrett (REU student, 2018)Nga Huynh (REU student, 2018)Sophie Rosas-Smith (REU student, 2018)Annika Esau (REU student, 2019)Cassandra Overney (REU student, 2019, now PhD student at MIT)Naveen Raman (REU student, 2019)Sydney Covitz (REU student, 2019)Jerry Lu (REU student, 2020)Madison Janes (REU student, 2020)Mark Chen (REU student, 2020)Mehal Kashyap (REU student, 2020)Priscila Santiesteban (REU student, 2020;
