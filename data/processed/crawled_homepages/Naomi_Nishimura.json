Cheriton School of Computer Science University of Waterloo Research My main area of interest is in algorithms, especially for graph problems, specializing in parameterized algorithms, reconfiguration problems, and the confluence of the two. A survey on reconfiguration that I wrote for a special issue can be found here. Further resources on reconfiguration can be found here. Slides from an overview talk on reconfiguration, given at CanaDAM 2017, can be found here. To join our new mailing list for researchers interested in reconfiguration, please go to the following page: A list of my papers can be found at the Computer Science bibliography site.
