O'Connor Associate Professor, College of Information and Computer Sciences Associate Director, Computational Social Science Institute University of Massachusetts Amherst brenocon@cs.umass.edu, @brendan642, @brenocon.bsky.social Office: CSB W238, 140 Governors Drive, Amherst, MA 01003 I am an associate professor in the College of Information and Computer Sciences at UMass Amherst. My group is the SLANG Lab, part of UMass NLP. I am also an associate director of the Computational Social Science Institute, and affiliated with the UMass CogSci and the Centers for Data Science and Intelligent Information Retrieval. Links: CV, Bio, Teaching, Talks, Notes, Misc. Some current things: For Fall 2025, I'm teaching CS 685, Advanced Natural Language Processing. (See also my previous teaching.) Some current/recent collaborative projects: Co-Insights: Fostering community collaboration to combat misinformation. We are part of the UMass team, in a multi-site project with several other institutions. Understanding variation in African American Language: Corpus and prosodic fieldwork perspectives with Kristine Yu, Lisa Green, and Meghan Armstrong-Abrami; see also our earlier work in disparities in natural language processing. Analyzing Cross-country Bias in News Coverage of International Conflicts and Disasters, 2023 Interdisciplinary Research Grant Project, with Przemyslaw Grabowicz, Ethan Zuckerman, and Paul Musgrave. SaTC: Identifying the Demographic Representativeness of Social Media Polls, with Przemyslaw Grabowicz. Leveraging Large Language Models to Provide Clinically Feasible Tools for Assessing Discourse in Individuals with Communication Impairments, 2024 Interdisciplinary Research Grant Project, with Jacquie Kurland and Anna Liu. Research: What can statistical text analysis tell us about society? I develop text analysis methods that can help answer social science questions. I'm interested in statistical machine learning and natural language processing, especially when informed by or applied to areas like political science or sociolinguistics. My work often uses text data from news and social media. There is a rich set of other faculty at UMass interested in areas from computational social science to natural language processing. See the Computational Social Science Institute (CSSI) website, and UMass NLP affiliates. Background: I joined UMass after receiving my PhD from Carnegie Mellon University's Machine Learning Department. I have also been a Visiting Fellow at Harvard IQSS, and interned with the Facebook Data Science team. Before grad school, I worked on crowdsourced annotations at CrowdFlower / Dolores Labs, and natural language search at Powerset. I started studying the intersection of AI and social science as an undergrad/masters student in Stanford Symbolic Systems (cognitive science, more or less). Link: Full bio.
