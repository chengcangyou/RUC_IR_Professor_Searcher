My research interests are in distributed systems, storage, and operating systems. I co-direct the Distributed And Storage Systems Laboratory (DASSL) at UIUC. My work on distributed storage reliability has exposed many severe bugs in popular distributed systems. Ideas from my research on corruption-tolerant replication are implemented in a financial database. My work has appeared in top systems venues such as OSDI, SOSP, EuroSys, and FAST and has been recognized with best-paper awards at SOSP 24, FAST 20, and FAST 18 and a best paper award nomination at FAST 17. I am a recipient of a NSF CAREER award. I was selected for the Rising Stars in EECS workshop and a recipient of Facebook 2019 PhD Fellowship. Previously, I was an affiliated/postdoctoral researcher at VMware Research Group. I earned my PhD in Computer Sciences from the University of Wisconsin – Madison, working with Prof. Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau and Prof. Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau. Prior to starting my Ph.D., I was a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India in the Mobility, Networks, and Systems group. Before that, I graduated with a master’s degree from Indian Institute of Technology – Bombay. I am looking for PhD and Masters students interested in systems to work with me. If you are a student at UIUC reach out to me. If you are a prospective, please apply to the UIUC CS graduate program and mention my name in the application.
