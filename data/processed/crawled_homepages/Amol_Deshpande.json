Research Interests My research spans a spectrum of topics in \"big data\", including database query optimization, privacy adaptive query processing, cloud computing, sensor network data management, uncertain data management, and graph databases. Some of the current and past research projects include: Privacy-first Data Management Systems: In this recently started project, we are exploring how to redesign data management systems and data processing frameworks to support privacy-aware data management. DataHub: Collaborative Data Science and Version Management at Scale: In this project (joint with Sam Madden@MIT and Aditya Parameswaran@Berkeley), we have been developing a platform to enable collaborative data analytics over big data. Declarative Graph Querying and Analytics: In this project, we are building a graph data management system and a suite of tools aimed at supporting real-time and historical querying and analytics over very large, dynamic, heterogeneous, and noisy graphs. I recently wrote a blog post for ACM SIGMOD Blog on Graph Data Management. Probabilistic Databases: In this project, we are investigating techniques for managing, querying, and performing inference over, very large probabilistic databases, and for Robust Uncertain Data Management. Energy Efficiency in Databases and Data Centers: In this project, we are investigating the issues of energy efficient computing in databases and in data centers. Sensor Networks: We are investigating data management and energy efficiency issues in wireless sensor networks.

[abstract] Analyzing interconnection structures among underlying entities or objects in a dataset through the use of graph analytics has been shown to provide tremendous value in many application domains. However, graphs are not the primary representation choice for storing most data today, and in order to have access to these analyses, users are forced to manually extract data from their data stores, construct the requisite graphs, and then load them into some graph engine in order to execute their graph analysis task. Moreover, in many cases (i.e. when the graphs are dense) these graphs can turn out to be significantly larger than the initial input stored in the database, making it infeasible to construct or analyze such graphs in-memory. In this paper we address both of these challenges by building a system that enables users to \"declaratively\" specify graph extraction tasks over a relational database schema and then execute graph algorithms on the extracted graphs. We propose a declarative domain specific language for this purpose, and pair it up with a novel \"condensed\", in-memory representation that significantly reduces the memory footprint of these graphs, permitting analysis of larger-than-memory graphs. We present a general algorithm for creating such a condensed representation for a large class of graph extraction queries against arbitrary schemas. We observe that the condensed representation suffers from a \"duplication\" issue, that results in inaccuracies for most graph algorithms. We then present a suite of in-memory representations that handle this duplication in different ways and allow \"trading off\" the memory required and the computational cost for executing different graph algorithms. We also introduce several novel \"deduplication\" algorithms for removing this duplication in the graph, which are of independent interest for graph compression, and provide a comprehensive experimental evaluation over several real-world and synthetic datasets illustrating these trade-offs.
