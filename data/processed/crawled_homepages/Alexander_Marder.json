Previously, I was a research scientist at CAIDA/UCSD focusing on analyzing and improving the security, resiliency, and performance of the Internet through empirical measurements. Before that, I was a postdoc at CAIDA/UCSD in 2020 and received my PhD at the University of Pennsylvania in 2019. My CV can be found here: CV I can be reached at amarderATjhu.edu. Research Interests My research uses empirical analyses to improve the security, resilience, and performance of networked systems. I bring a unique skill set to network analysis and design, with a deep understanding of Internet topology, creative approaches to gathering data, and extensive experience measuring network properties. My data-driven approach naturally applies to a wide breadth of problems, including securing 5G communication against adversary nation-states, revealing physical resilience and security weaknesses in critical networks, and detecting performance bottlenecks that lead to broadband inequities. Current Research Efforts NSF Convergence Accelerator Joint NSF/DOD Phase 2 AVOID 5G: Automatic Verification Of Internet Data-paths for 5G ($5,000,000) Alexander Marder (PI), kc claffy, Ricky Mok, Kyle Jamieson, Erik Kline We were one of 5 teams chosen to continue our work in Phase 2. This project is a collaboration between Johns Hopkins, UCSD/CAIDA, Princeton, and USC ISI. NSF Convergence Accelerator 2022 Joint NSF/DOD Phase 1 5G Traffic Sovereignty: Operating Through an Adversarial Internet ($750,000) Alexander Marder (PI), Ricky Mok (Co-PI), kc claffy (Co-PI) This is one of 16 commercial or university-led projects funded in response to the joint solicitation by NSF and DOD to allow DOD operators to securely communicate with 5G devices in commercial networks. Our project synthesizes recent advances in Internet measurement and programmable data planes to automatically send traffic along verified safe paths. Project description 5G wireless technology has the potential to transform DOD mission-critical operations, but taking full advantage of this opportunity requires new techniques to operate through commercial networks worldwide. Connecting mission-critical devices to commercial 5G networks will transform DOD communications, but it also increases the attack surface for sensitive and critical communications by exposing the traffic to the Internet at large. Nation-states have nearly inexhaustible resources to disrupt traffic or passively recognize communications patterns via network infrastructure under their control, and the verified-trust paradigm in a zero-trust architecture cannot prevent these attacks. Any secure communication solution in the 5G space must account for adversarial Internet paths that traverse networks and routers that are potentially controlled by adversary nation-states. In essence, operating through 5G networks requires not just focusing on the wireless last hop, but also the Internet paths to reach the last hop. This project combines three components to create an unprecedented ability to leverage commercial 5G networks for secure and resilient communication. The first component takes advantage of programmable data planes to facilitate path measurements – and shift communications onto trustworthy paths – without modifying DOD applications, existing network devices, or third-party networks. Component 2 creates an automated measurement application that interfaces with the router from Component 1 to identify router-level paths that avoid adversaries, as well as verify in real-time that communication paths for active flows behave as expected. Component 3 will recommend ways for DOD to expand the availability of secure communication paths to 5G networks. This last component will identify high-value networks whose inclusion in an industry zone-of-trust could benefit DOD, and apply existing geopolitical influence frameworks to evaluate trustworthy communication paths between DOD and geographic regions. Tackling this problem requires convergence research across six areas of expertise: network measurement for path assessment; 5G communication and transport; programmable switch implementation; realistic evaluation platforms; security constraints of 5G-connected infrastructure; and geopolitical influence and strategy in the cyber domain. This interdisciplinary and cross-sector collaboration targets a persistently unsolved challenge that the 5G ecosystem amplifies in importance: automatic selection of communication paths with 5G devices to avoid networks, locations, or hardware potentially controlled by a nation-state adversary. This project will provide broad impact by complementing zero-trust architectures and secure 5G implementations, and by offering a transformative approach to how DoD and critical infrastructure can operate through the exploding yet dangerously opaque 5G ecosystem. Analyzing the Performance of the Cloud-Centric Internet The shift to running user-facing applications in the public cloud providers requires us to similarly shift measurement focus to the cloud networks. But, the cloud also provides the unprecedented opportunity to colocate our measurement infrastructure in the same data centers and networks as popular applications. These project address our current shortcomings in empirical measurements and take advantage of the enormous opportunity that public cloud afford performance analyses. NSF CNS Medium: Detection and Analysis of Infrastructure Bottlenecks in a Cloud-Centric Internet ($1,200,000) Ricky Mok (PI), Alexander Marder (Co-PI), kc claffy (Co-PI) Project description The CoVID-19 pandemic and associated quarantine has accelerated the Internet’s fundamental shift from a peer-to-peer to a cloud-centric model. Our entire lives have moved online, now predominantly mediated by services in the cloud, and public clouds are rapidly evolving to meet increasing requirements and demands from customers and end users. The importance of the clouds in the modern Internet triggers questions regarding how well existing Internet backbone networks support the applications and content now served from the clouds. Cloud providers can afford the infrastructure upgrades to support the needs of low latency or high throughput applications, but their ability to adapt infrastructure to application demands ends at their network border. The economics of deploying and operating transit backbone infrastructure combine with the surge in traffic toward cloud services to induce performance bottlenecks in the changing Internet landscape. This project proposes an ambitious effort to design measurement and analysis tools that can transform our understanding of cloud connectivity performance and reachability in the U.S. and around the world. Researchers currently lack the measurement ability to even identify such bottlenecks at scale, much less assess their impact on Internet users. The project is structured as two tasks that will combine to reveal performance bottlenecks outside the cloud networks where the high cost of deployment and operations leads to infrastructure bottlenecks for cloud applications. The first task will develop novel techniques to identify performance bottleneck links between cloud datacenters and thousands of publicly accessible speed test servers, by synthesizing active measurements with TCP flows. The second task will analyze the bottleneck links we identify with comprehensive path measurements from cloud datacenters to the entire public Internet, and we will develop new techniques to support inference of the geographic locations of bottleneck links by geolocating where paths exit cloud networks. The intellectual merit of this project stems from the innovative methods we will develop and validate to conduct accurate, scalable, and reliable topology and performance measurements of a critical component of the modern Internet, overcoming cost barriers that have prevented measurement studies from the cloud. The measured features and labels the project generates will provide an ideal basis to address the persistent challenge in applying machine learning techniques to network infrastructure research. The project will also have broader impacts outside of the scientific research agenda. The tools and data the project generates will be valuable to enterprises and application developers deploying into the cloud, as well as policy-makers seeking to understand bottlenecks in U.S. Internet infrastructure. The data, tools, and analyses can also lead to the discovery of broadband performance inequities in the U.S. and inform future public investment in infrastructure. Experience with cloud applications and measurements will be incorporated into an undergraduate data science course and undergraduate research mentorships. NSF CRII: Measurement Capabilities for the Modern Internet ($175,000) Alexander Marder (PI) Project description The growing deployment of low-latency and high-throughput applications, the upfront and maintenance costs of computing resources, and constantly evolving security threats make it increasingly complex and costly for organizations to host services and applications themselves. Public cloud providers, like Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), ease that burden by allowing organizations to build and scale their applications on networks and hardware managed by the cloud provider. As applications shifted into the clouds, the Internet fundamentally changed from peer-to-peer to a cloud-centric model. The importance of the clouds in the modern Internet necessitates understanding the paths between cloud applications and users to better inform public policy and network operations, and we propose an ambitious effort to directly observe and interpret these cloud application paths at the router leve",
