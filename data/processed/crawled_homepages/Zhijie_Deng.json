I obtained the Ph.D. degree from Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University in June 2022, under the supervision of Prof. Bo Zhang and Prof. Jun Zhu. Before that, I received the B.S. degree from Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University in 2017. I was a visiting scholar from July 2016 to September 2016 in Machine Learning Department, Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof. Eric P. Xing. My principal research interests lie in the development of machine learning and statistical methodology, spanning generative models, spectral methods, Bayesian inference, etc. The developed methods have been applied to scenarios such as image/language/video generation, Embodied AI, semi-/self-/un-supervised learning, PDE solving, uncertainty quantification, and trustworthy ML. Openings I am looking for interns, visitors, and postdocs who have a strong background in mathematics/physics/computer science and are eager to get involved in cutting-edge, fundamental AI research (especially in fields of text, image, and multi-modal content generation and efficient LLM inference). If you are interested, feel free to drop me an email. Selected Publications [More] * equal contribution. † corresponding author.
