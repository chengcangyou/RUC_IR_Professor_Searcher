Teaching CS2610 Cloud Fundamentals and Web Programming (in spring semester) CS4610 Virtualization and Cloud Systems (in fall semester) CS4740 Big Data Technologies (spring 2015) CS7700 Cloud and Enterprise Systems (in spring semester) Research My research is in distributed systems and cloud computing with a current focus on performance, scalability, security of large-scale web applications and IoT stream processing. My research is motivated by the essential requirement of simultaneously achieving good performance and high utilization for cost efficiency in cloud computing environments. Good performance (e.g., fast response time) is critical for the business of e-commerce web applications like Amazon. High utilization through virtualization and hardware resource sharing is essential for cloud vendors for a high return on investment. However, both practitioners and researchers have experienced large response time fluctuations or unpredictable performance in the cloud, especially when the utilization becomes high. To solve this problem, my research has been focusing on two aspects: first, investigate various system-level factors that cause the performance unpredictability of systems running at moderate to high resource utilization; second, design, implement and evaluate practical solutions to mitigate the negative impact of those factors and achieve the performance predictability at high resource utilization.
