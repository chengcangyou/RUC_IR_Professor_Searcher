Since 2020, I serve in the Editorial board of reviewers of the Journal of Machine Learning Research. I served (or will be serving soon) on the program committees of the following conferences: ESA 2024, ICALP 2023, SODA 2022, WADS 2021, SODA 2020, ESA 2019 and WAOA 2014. I was the main organizer of the 11th Israeli CS Theory Day. To Top Teaching Currently, I am in a sabattical, and do not teach. In past semesters, I tought the courses Data Structures (in Spring 2022, Spring 2023, Spring 2024 and Winter 2024-2025). Combinatorial Optimization (in Spring 2020, Spring 2021, Spring 2023 and Winter 2024-2025,). Design and Analysis of Algorithms (in Winter 2019-2020, Winter 2020-2021, Winter 2021-2022, Winter 2022-2023, Winter 2023-2024, Spring 2025). Sublinear Time Algorithms (in Spring 2022 and Spring 2024). Seminar in Online Algorithms (in Winter 2020-2021, Spring 2022 and Winter 2023-2024). Previously, at the Open University of Israel, I served as an instructor in the seminars Research Seminar: Algorithms and Theory and Seminar in Algorithms; and also developed a distance learning course named Algorithms for Big Data. The book appearing below was written as part of the development process of the course, and serves as the textbook of the course. To Top Book The book covers the topics of data stream algorithms, sublinear time algorithms and Map-Reduce algorithms from a theoretical point of view, and was designed for self-study. More information about the book is available at the publisher's website. An erratum with a few very minor errors in the book is available here. To Top",
