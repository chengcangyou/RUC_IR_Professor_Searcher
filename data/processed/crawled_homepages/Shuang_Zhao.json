I am an Associate Professor at the Siebel School of Computing and Data Science of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Before joining UIUC, I served as an Associate Professor at the University of California, Irvine (UCI). I earned my PhD from Cornell University in 2014, where I was advised by Kavita Bala. I was also honored to receive the NSF CAREER Award in 2023. Research focus: My group works broadly in 3D computer graphics and vision. We focus on devising numerical algorithms to simulate physical phenomena, such as light transport in complex environments. Additionally, we develop efficient solutions for inverse problems, specifically centering on the inference and optimization of geometric and material properties.
