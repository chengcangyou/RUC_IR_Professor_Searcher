He lectured electronics courses at the University of Belgrade from 1992 to 1996. He spent two years with Silicon Systems, Inc., Texas Instruments Storage Products Group, San Jose, CA, working on disk-drive signal processing electronics. In 1999, he joined the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California at Berkeley, where he is now a Professor. His research activities include digital and analog integrated circuit design and VLSI implementation of communications and signal processing algorithms. He is co-author of the book Digital Integrated Circuits: A Design Perspective, 2nd ed, Prentice-Hall, 2003.Dr. NikoliÄ received the NSF CAREER award in 2003, College of Engineering Best Doctoral Dissertation Prize and Anil K. Jain Prize for the Best Doctoral Dissertation in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of California at Davis in 1999, as well as the City of Belgrade Award for the Best Diploma Thesis in 1992. or work with his students and colleagues, he has received the best paper awards at the IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference, the Symposium on VLSI Circuits, the IEEE International SOI Conference, the European Solid-State Device Research Conference, the European Solid-State Circuits Conference, the IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference, the S3S Conference, the Design Automation Conference, and the ACM/IEEE International Symposium of Low-Power Electronics.From 2014 to 2015, he was a Distinguished Lecturer of the IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society. He was a Technical Program Chair for the 2022 Symposium on VLSI Technology and Circuits, and a General Chair for the 2024 IEEE Symposium on VLSI Technology and Circuits.
