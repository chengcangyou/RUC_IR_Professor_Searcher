Prior research experience in image analysis, machine learning, or other related areas is a plus. Programming background in Python or C/C++ is preferred. If you are interested in joining us, please send Dr. Zhang an email along with your CV in advance. About Me I am an assistant professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science at University of Virginia. My research work focuses on developing novel models at the intersection of statistics, mathematics, and computer engineering in the field of medical and biological imaging. More specifically, my current research projects include developing machine learning methods in image registration, segmentation, and statistical shape analysis, with applications to cardiovascular imaging, neuroimaging, and computer-assisted surgery. Before joining UVA, I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at University of Utah and worked as a postdoctoral associate at Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I received the Young Scientist Award 2014 and was a runnerup for Young Scientist Award 2016. I am a member of MICCAI society and have been actively serving as an area chair for MICCAI, ISBI, and MIDL.
