Before joining NJIT, I received my Ph.D. degree from Rutgers University, where I was advised by Dr. Yingying Chen. My research interests span Applied Machine Learning, Security and Privacy for Mobile Systems, and Robust and Trustworthy ML/AI. My research work has been published at top-tier security, mobile sensing, and ML/AI venues (e.g., IEEE S&P, ACM CCS, ACSAC, ACM MobiCom, ACM MobiSys, ACM SenSys, ACM MobiHoc, ACM UbiComp, ICCV, AAAI, ECCV).

(Acceptance rate: 17%) Recent Research Work My current research focuses on designing machine learning and sensing solutions to address real-world problems, including user authentication, 3D skeleton posture reconstruction, smart healthcare (e.g., examining the risk of COVID-19), indoor localization, activity/gesture recognition, etc. I am also interested in revealing security vulnerabilities in emerging machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI), augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR), and voice assistant platforms, with the hope of addressing the inherited security issues and bringing trustworthiness to end users. Privacy Leakage via Speech-induced Vibrations on Room Objects through Remote Sensing [ACM CCS 2023] ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security PDF We revisit the problem of speech eavesdropping and show that a remote, long-distance, and even thru-the-wall speech eavesdropping attack is possible. We discover a new form of speech eavesdropping attack that remotely elicits speech from minute surface vibrations upon common room objects (e.g., paper bags, plastic storage bin) via mmWave sensing, signal processing, and advanced deep learning techniques. Privacy Leakage via Unrestricted Motion-Position Sensors in the Age of Virtual Reality [IEEE S&P 2023] IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy PDF / Demo Video Virtual Reality (VR) has gained popularity in numerous fields. In this project, we conduct a comprehensive study to assess the trustworthiness of the embedded sensors on VR, which embed various forms of sensitive data that may put users' privacy at risk. We find that accessing most on-board sensors (e.g., motion, position, and button sensors) on VR SDKs/APIs requires no usecurity permission, exposing a huge attack surface for an adversary to steal the userâs privacy. Audio-domain Position-independent Backdoor Attack via Unnoticeable Triggers [ACM MobiCom 2022] Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking PDF Deep learning models have become key enablers of voice user interfaces. We investigate an effective yet stealthy training-phase (backdoor) attack in the audio domain, where hidden/unnoticeable trigger patterns are injected through training set poisoning and overwrite the model's predictions in the inference phase. An attacker can play an unnoticeable audio trigger (e.g., bird chirps, foot steps) into live speech of a victim to launch the attack. Robust and Imperceptible Backdoor Attack against Compact DNN [Springer ECCV 2022] European Conference on Computer Vision PDF / Code Recently backdoor attack has become an emerging threat to the security of deep neural network (DNN) models. In this project, we propose to study and develop Robust and Imperceptible Backdoor Attack against Compact DNN models (RIBAC). By performing systematic analysis and exploration on the important design knobs, we propose a framework that can learn the proper trigger patterns, model parameters and pruning masks in an efficient way. Privacy Leakage via Subtle Facial Dynamics Captured by AR/VR Headsets [ACM MobiCom 2021] Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking PDF / Demo Video We show a serious privacy risk of using voice interfaces while the user is wearing the face-mounted AR/VR devices. We design an eavesdropping attack, Face-Mic, which learns speech-associated subtle facial dynamics captured by zero-permission motion sensors in AR/VR headsets to infer highly sensitive information of live human speech. 3D Skeleton Posture Reconstruction Leveraging mmWave Radar [Elsevier Smart Health] PDF Human skeleton posture reconstruction is an essential component for human-computer interactions (HCI) in various application domains. Traditional approaches usually rely on either cameras or on-body sensors, which induce privacy concerns or inconvenient practical setups. This project proposes a low-cost contactless skeleton posture reconstruction system, mPose, which can reconstruct a userâs 3D skeleton postures by learning on 3D cloud points collected with a single mmWave radar. Monitoring Vital Signs of Multiple People Leveraging a Single Phased-MIMO Radar [IEEE J-ERM] IEEE Journal of Electromagnetics RF and Microwaves in Medicine and Biology PDF Vital sign monitoring plays a critical role in tracking the physiological state of people and enabling various healthrelated applications (e.g., recommending a change of lifestyle, examining the risk of COVID-19). Traditional approaches rely on hospitalization or body-attached instruments, which are costly and intrusive. In this paper, using an off-the-shelf Texas Instrument automotive FMCW radar, we design and implement a time-division multiplexing (TDM) phased-MIMO radar sensing system that allows high-precision vital sign monitoring of multiple people. Detecting Machine-induced Audio Attacks with Microphone Array [ACM CCS 2021] ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security PDF With the popularity of intelligent audio systems in recent years, their vulnerabilities have become an increasing public concern. Existing studies have designed a set of machine-induced audio attacks1, such as replay attacks, synthesis attacks, hidden voice commands, inaudible attacks, and audio adversarial examples. This project builds a holistic solution for detecting machine-induced audio attacks leveraging multi-channel microphone arrays and learning spatial information in speeches via deep neural networks.
