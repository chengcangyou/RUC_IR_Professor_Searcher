From September 2015 to January 2019, I was a Software and Research Engineering in Google's network infrastructure team. Before that, I received my PhD degree from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of Purdue University in August 2015, advised by Prof. Xiaojun Lin. Research Interests Network for AI: Building Hybrid Optical/Electrical Data Center networks for AI Clusters. On the network side, we cover topology, routing and protocol design; on the host side, we focus on RDMA, collective communication, container networking, etc. AI for Network: Build a scalable and robust AI model to support the design of network topology, routing, communication algorithm, job scheduling, etc. News [June 2025]: One paper is accepted by ToN.
