I am also a research affiliate at MIT CSAIL, where I continue to work with the program analysis and compilation group (PAC) of Martin Rinard, where I was also a postdoctoral researcher. I received my PhD in February 2018 at University of Zurich (Switzerland) where I primarily worked on software runtime analytics. During my PhD, I was a research intern at IBM Watson Research Center in New York. I received my master's and bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Technical University of Vienna. Recent News I joined the faculty of TU Wien as a tenure-track assistant professor where I lead the IPA Lab Paper Unified Configuration Setting Access in Configuration Management Systems accepted at ICPC'20 Paper Monitoring-aware IDEs with TU Delft accepted at FSE'19 Paper Interactive Production Performance Feedback in the IDE accepted at ICSE'19 Our research on continuous and incremental performance modeling has received a Facebook Research Award New paper Performance Issues? Hey DevOps, mind the uncertainty! accepted at IEEE Software Our research on synthesizing security patches using supervised machine learning has received an IBM Research Award New paper We're doing it live: A multi-method empirical study on continuous experimentation accepted at IST journal Research Interests My current research interests are in programming languages and how they relate to computing and industrial infrastructure. I am interested in developing approaches to produce reliable infrastructure through synthesis and verification techniques.
