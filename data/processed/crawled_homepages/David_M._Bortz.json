Frequently, we apply these methods to biological systems, including collective and individual motion in wound healing, structured population dynamics, and disease ecology and epidemiology. However, more recently, we have expanded the applications to include atmospheric fluid models and computational plasma physics in the context of fusion. These projects have been financially supported by NSF, NIH-NIGMS, AFOSR, DOE, and CDPHE.Group MembersNora Heitzman-BreenCristian López (joint with Stephen Becker)Rainey LyonsSeth Minor (joint with Vanja Dukic)Nic Rummel (joint with Stephen Becker)Moyi Tian (joint with Nancy Rodriguez)April TranCollaboratorsStephen BeckerJeff CameronBeth CarltonYoungsoo ChoiAndrew ChristliebGreg DwyerVanja DukicXuedong LiuDan MessengerNancy RodriguezActive Funding9/2025-8/2028 PI: NSF eMB DMS-25275329/2023-8/2028 PI: NIH-NIGMS MIRA R35GM1493359/2022-8/2027 CU PI: DOE ASCR MMICC DE-SC00233467/2021-6/2026 PI: NSF MODULUS MCB-2054085Press:2025September 30 - Unveiling What’s Under the Hood in AI Weather Models - Eos (AGU news magazine)2024October 1 - The Weak Form is Stronger Than You Think - SIAM News (front page!)2023October 23 - Researchers strive to help models learn from ‘noisy’ data - Colorado Arts & Sciences MagazineJuly 24 - Dan Messenger selected to attend Heidelberg Laureate Forum2022October 26 - New study shows how to learn the equations of cell migration - CU Boulder TodayOctober 19 - CU Boulder joins national effort to advance nuclear fusion research - Colorado Arts & Sciences Magazine2021September 21 - 1 in 99 people in Colorado estimated to be infectious with COVID-19 - Colorado NewslineMarch 1 - Model suggests COVID-19 may have been in Colorado as early as January 2020 - KDVR FOX31December 15 - The first COVID-19 case likely in Colorado way before March - UCHealth Today2020October 8 - Coronavirus Hit the U.S. Long Before We Knew - Wall Street JournalSeptember 1 - So You Think You Had COVID-19 Before March? - 5280 MagazineJune 16 - What Colorado is getting right about reopening - PoliticoJune 12 - CU Mathematician on the front lines of Colorado’s coronavirus response - CU Boulder TodayMay 6 - Scientists shed light on essential carbon-fixing machinery in bacteria - CU Boulder TodayMarch 23 - Even single-celled organisms need their space: Squished bacteria may shut down photosynthesis - CU Boulder TodayApril 10 - Colorado’s slowdown in coronavirus growth a sign that social distancing has worked, doctors say - Colorado Springs GazetteMarch 28 - Coronavirus in Colorado: Experts begin sharing stark predictions - Colorado Springs Gazette",
