My main research area is information security. My research focuses on cryptographic algorithms and protocols as well as their applications to computer and network security and mobile communications. My favourite research topics are hash functions, MAC algorithms, stream ciphers and block ciphers. I am still working on my book on hash functions (is my PhD thesis on this subject is out of print but here is finally an electronic version from 1993). I hope to complete it by late 2013. My favourite hash function is RIPEMD-160 (more details at this site). My favourite MAC is MDx-MAC (click here for the paper ). I am teaching cryptology, network security, coding theory, and discrete applied algebra at the K.U.Leuven. I have been visiting professor at the Technical University Denmark, the Ruhr Universitaet Bochum (Germany), the Graz University of Technology (Austria), the University of Bergen (Norway), and the Universiteit Gent (Belgium). In '93-'94 I was a research fellow at the University of California at Berkeley. I have contributed to the growth of COSIC, a research group in cryptology and its applications.  The last time I counted, there were 12 postdocs and 40 PhD students or researchers. My colleagues in COSIC are Prof. Claudia Diaz, Prof. Vincent Rijmen, Prof. Joos Vandewalle and Prof. Ingrid Verbauwhede. I am Erasmus+ coordinator for the Electrical Engineering Department.  I am responsible for the incoming and outgoing students. I have organized IPICS 2006 and co-organized WISSEC 2006. I have also organized the ESAT-COSIC biennial Summer School on cryptography. The main strength of this course (first edition in 1989) is that it provides speakers with a widely varying background, varying from well-known researchers in cryptology to experts in its applications from the banking and telecommunication world.  The last edition had close to 80 participants. The next edition of this course is planned for the first week of June 2013. In addition to the 12 Summer Schools in Leuven, I have lectured at about 30 intensive courses in Austria (2), Brazil, China, Denmark, Estonia, Finland (6), France (2), Greece (4), India, Lebanon, Poland (2), Spain, Sweden, Tunesia (2), UK, USA (2). Currently, I am project manager of the Network of Excellence ECRYPT II (Cryptology) (2008-2013). Together with Ingrid Verbauwhede I am managing BCRYPT BCRYPT (Belgian Fundamental Research on Cryptology an Information Security) (2007-2011). I am charge of the COSIC participation to the IBBT (Interdisciplinary Institute for BroadBand Technology. I am also in charge of adapID (ADvanced APplications for the Belgian eID card) which is a GBO project sponsored by the IWT. I have been project manager of STORK, and NESSIE, which stands for New European Schemes for Signatures, Integrity and Encryption also sponsored under the IST programme. More information about our research projects (here), To fill my days, I do some consulting for the financial and ICT industry and I participate to the work of ISO/IEC JTC1/SC27/WG2. I am President of the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) and Co-founder and chairman of LSEC vzw (Leuven Security Excellence Consortium). I am Member of the Steering Committee of the Workshop Fast Software Encryption (since 1993), International Workshop on Information Security, Korea (since 2002); I also served on the steering committee of RSA Security Cryptographer's Track, USA, (2001-2004). My favourite book on cryptography is the Handbook of Applied Cryptography. My favourite book on cryptography politics is Privacy on the Line. The Politics of Wiretapping and Encryption, Updated and Expanded Edition, 2007. My favourite journal is the Journal of Craptology.
