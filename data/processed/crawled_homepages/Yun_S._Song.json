I work at the interface of AI/ML, statistics, and biology. I am currently serving as the Director of the Center for Computational Biology. I am an IGI Investigator and also a core member of the UCSF/UC Berkeley Joint Program in Computational Precision Health and the Center for Theoretical & Evolutionary Genomics. A note on my name: There are only 7 characters in my first and last names combined. Despite this seeming simplicity, a number of people have shown their creativity in misspelling my name. Some examples include \"Sun Yong, Yun Sun, Yun Sung, Yung Son, Yon Song, Yun Soon, Jun Song\", and just plain \"Yum\" and \"Yup.\" My first name is Yun, pronounced \"Yoon\" [ audio ]; please don't spell it that way, though. Also, my middle name is not Sing. Of Reflections © 2008 Yun S. Song. All rights reserved.",
