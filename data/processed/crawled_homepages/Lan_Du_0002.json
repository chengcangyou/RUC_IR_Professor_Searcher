He is strongly interested in cross-disciplinary research involving machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to solve real-world problems in different disciplines. He believes that the key to unlocking the full potential of AI lies in bridging the gap between advanced AI research and its practical application. As an Australian leading researcher in text analytics, he is best known for his research on learning and understanding the semantics of free language texts. Specifically, his research interest lies in the joint area of machine/deep learning and natural language processing, which includes (but is not limited to) Active learning: both theories and applicationsUncertainty Estimation for NLP and CV on either uni-modal or multimodal dataKnowledge distillation in CV and NLPMulti-view/modal learningAnd their applications in cross-disciplinary areas, including public health, marketing, etc. Monash teaching commitmentDr Lan Du has experience as the Chief Examiner for the following units in the Faculty of IT: FIT5149 Applied data analysisFIT5196 Data wrangling Lan Du has experience as the Lecturer for the following units in the Faculty of IT: FIT5149 Applied data analysisFIT5196 Data wrangling Expertise related to UN Sustainable Development Goals In 2015, UN member states agreed to 17 global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all.
