I build computer systems to train and deploy large-scale ML models. My research focuses on end-to-end ML pipelines, aiming to improve their scalability, efficiency, and security by co-designing the many interacting systems that comprise them. My interests span the computing stack – including systems, databases, architecture, and security – and their intersection with machine learning. I completed my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, advised by Christos Kozyrakis. I was a Visiting Researcher in the FAIR and infrastructure teams at Meta from 2020-2022, where I built data systems for Meta’s ML training pipelines. I received my B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Cornell University, where I worked with Ed Suh. Prospective Students: I have multiple PhD openings in my group. I am also looking for motivated graduate students and undergraduate researchers at CU Boulder. Please reach out!",
