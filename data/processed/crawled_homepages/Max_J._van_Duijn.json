My main interest is in language and stories in relation to cognition and Artificial Intelligence. In my academic I work seek to combine approaches and methods from both the sciences and humanities. Outside the university, my writing and talks cover storytelling, language, evolution, AI, and practical applications of these topics in business and society. Footer Banner Section E-MAIL © 2021",
