Before joining Meta, I was a Sr. Research Scientist at Amazon Alexa/AGI, working on foundation models for audio/music. Before moving to industry, I was a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in AI at the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London (UK) and a Turing Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute (UK). At QMUL, I co-led the Machine Listening Lab at the Centre for Digital Music. Before that, I was a Lecturer in Computing at the School of Computing, University of Kent (UK) and a postdoctoral researcher in the CIBIM lab at the Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford. I did PhD (summa cum laude) in Computer Science at the Institute for Signal Processing, University of Lübeck (Germany) under the supervision of Prof. Alfred Mertins. My PhD thesis on audio event detection was awarded the Bernd Fischer Award for the best PhD thesis in 2018. In 2021, I was awarded IEEE-EMBS Best Paper Award 2019-20. I investigate topics in the fields of machine learning/deep learning and signal processing. I am particularly interested in speech/audio processing, biosignal analysis, and healthcare applications.
