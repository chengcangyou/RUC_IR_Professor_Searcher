Previously I was a professor at Rutgers from Fall 2018 – Spring 2024. I received my Ph.D. from Columbia University (2010–2016), with Cliff Stein as my advisor. My research has been generously supported by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, Charles S. Baylis endowment from NYU, Google Research (Research Scholar Program), and the National Science Foundation (NSF) (Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award: CCF-1942010). Interests:  Design and analysis of algorithms, especially graph algorithms. Specific topics include sublinear algorithms (e.g. streaming/parallel), dynamic graph algorithms, online algorithms, distributed algorithms, and approximation algorithms. NYU Theory: I am part of the theory group at NYU, which spans both CS@Tandon and CS@Courant. Prospective PhD Students: I am hiring PhD students for Fall 2026. I am specifically looking for students with a strong  background in math or theoretical computer science. If you are interested in working with me, apply to NYU and mention me in the application! (The PhD programs at NYU Courant and NYU Tandon have been merged into a single PhD program. So you just have to send one application to NYU Computer Science. See the theory page for more info.) Advising: I am fortunate to have advised the following PhD students — Vikrant Ashvinkumar (at Rutgers, co-advised with Jie Gao, 2021–now) — Zach Langely (2019–2024). — Aditi Dudeja (2017–2023).
