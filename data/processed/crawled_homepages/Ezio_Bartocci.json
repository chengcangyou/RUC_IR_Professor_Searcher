Farsag) Follow me on LinkedIn I am a Full Professor at TU Wien, where I lead the Trustworthy Cyber-Physical Systems (TrustCPS) Research Group within the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Research Unit. My research focuses on developing formal methods and computational tools that ensure the safety, security, energy-efficiency and correctness of AI-based CPS with a strong emphasis on sustainability. I earned my B.S. in Computer Science, M.S. in Bioinformatics, and Ph.D. in Information Science and Complex Systems from the University of Camerino, Italy. From 2010-2012, I conducted postdoctoral research at Stony Brook University (NY, US), contributing to the American NSF-funded CMACS project (coordinated by the Turing-Award Winner Prof. Edmund Clarke) on computational cardiac dynamics. Since joining TU Wien in 2012 as University Assistant, I became tenure-track Assistant Professor in 2015, Associate Professor in 2019, and I was appointed Full Professor in 2020. I am currently Vice-Chair of the Marie SkÅodowska-Curie COFUND doctoral programme LogiCS@TUWien and Coordinator of the TrustCPS Special Interest Group within the TU Wien Cybersecurity Center (CySec). Since 2024, I have been the Chair of the Doctoral College on Trustworthy Autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems, and since 2025, I am serving as Research Focus Coordinator for Computer Engineering at the Faculty of Informatics, TU Wien. My research achievements have been recognized through multiple Best Paper Awards at EMSOFT 2025, QEST 2022, ADHS 2021, and RV 2011, along with the Radhia Cousot Young Researcher Award (SAS 2022) and the EASST Best Software Science Award (ETAPS 2022).
