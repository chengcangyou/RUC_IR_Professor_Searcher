My primary research interests include Autonomous and Autonomic Systems, Context-Aware Systems, Distributed Systems, and Self-Adaptive Systems. My work focuses on automated approaches for developing correct-by-construction practical solutions grounded in theoretical understanding and well-established architectural principles. I have gained extensive experience working across diverse countries and contexts, actively engaging with the international research community. I also have consolidated experience in National and European Union projects and collaborate with various companies worldwide. Recently, I have focused on: Ethical-aware Autonomous Systems Automated context-aware ethics-based negotiation in the autonomous vehicle and robot domains. Self-adaptive Multi-robot Systems Automated synthesis for handling uncertainty through mission adaptation and enforcing correctly distributed coordination. Cloud-to-Autonomous-Vehicles Continuum Enabling the cloud-to-autonomous-vehicles continuum for future industrial applications. Microservice Architecture Automated migration of monoliths to scalable and correctly coordinated microservice-oriented distributed systems. Distributed Software Synthesis Automated reasoning and synthesis techniques for correct-by-construction solutions, such as fully decentralized coordination and mission/protocol adaptation. About Me I am an Associate Professor at the Department of Information Engineering, Computer Science, and Mathematics (DISIM), University of LâAquila. I graduated with honors in Computer Science at the University of LâAquila in April 2004, and I received my Ph.D. in April 2008 with the highest distinction. I collaborate with various companies and international research groups worldwide. I have consolidated experience in European Union and Italian research and development projects, serving as principal investigator, scientific and technical project leader, research unit coordinator, and work package leader. I am the (co-)author of approximately 120 publications in international journals, conference proceedings, book chapters, and editorials. I serve as a reviewer for several international conferences, workshops, and top-tier international journals. I am also an associate editor and a member of the editorial board for several international journals. Additionally, I act as the lead guest editor for various special issues and thematic series and am actively involved in the organization of workshops and conferences in the field of Software Engineering. My research focuses on the application of automated software engineering techniques and practical formal methods to the modeling, architecture, analysis, and automatic synthesis of complex systems, spanning from theory to practice. The overarching goal is to simplify inherent system complexity for developers by leveraging expressive yet usable specification notations and languages, enabling automated reasoning and synthesis for correct-by-construction composition, coordination, and adaptation. My primary research contributions lie in the domains of distributed self-aware systems that support autonomic self-management operations and autonomous self-adaptive behaviors, including multi-robot and (micro)service-oriented systems. These systems involve distributed computing resources endowed with self-managing and decision-making capabilities, adapting dynamically to unpredictable changes, emerging goals, changing contexts, and, more recently, end-user ethical preferences. I released a number of software tools and platforms in connection with research projects and publications. Research100% Services100% Students100% Responsibility100% SoSy Lab I serve as the head of the Software Synthesis Lab, where I coordinate all research and development activities. The Software Synthesis Lab (>>> go to Laboratory Web Site) focuses on automated software synthesis approaches for the modeling, verification, and analysis of complex self-aware distributed systems that support autonomic and autonomous self-adaptive behaviors, including multi-robot and (micro)service-oriented systems. The aim is to simplify the inherent complexity for developers through the use of practical specification formalisms, enabling automated reasoning and synthesis for correct-by-construction composition, coordination and adaptation. Targeted systems involve distributed computing resources equipped with autonomic self-management and autonomous decision-making capabilities, enabling dynamic adaptation to unforeseen goal and mission changes, evolving operational contexts, and end-user ethical preferences.
