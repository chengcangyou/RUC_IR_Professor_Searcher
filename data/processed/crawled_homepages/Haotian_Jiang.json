Create yours today.Get Started​Haotian JiangI am an assistant professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of Chicago. ​ Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Algorithms Group at Microsoft Research, Remond. I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Washington where I was part of the theory group in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering. I was fortunate to be advised by Yin Tat Lee. ​ ​DOWNLOAD FULL CVI am looking for self-motivated PhD students interested in theoretical computer science/applied mathematics. If you are interested in working with me, please consider applying to the UChicago CS PhD program and mention my name in your application. ​ResearchI work broadly in theoretical computer science and applied mathematics. In particular, currently I am interested in convex optimization, submodular function minimization, discrepancy theory, high dimensional probability, and their applications. ​ See here for a full list of publications. TeachingTeaching at the University of Chicago CMSC/MATH 39600-1: Geometric Discrepancy Theory (Aut'24) CMSC 31801-1: High-Dimensional Probability (Aut'24, Spr'26) CMSC 27200: Theory of Algorithms (Win'25, Win'26) ​​Contact Information Email: ​​jhtdavid at uchicago dot edu Office: Room 239, John Crerar Library, 5730 S.
