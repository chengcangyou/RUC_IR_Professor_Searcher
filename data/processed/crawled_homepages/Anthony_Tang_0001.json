I'm passionate about Human-Computer Interaction and other weird things. Twitter G. Scholar Github e-Mail Howdy ho! I am an Associate Professor in the School of Computing and Information Systems at the Singapore Management University. I direct the RICELab (Rethinking Interaction, Collaboration and Engagement) research group. Previously, I was at the Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto, and in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Calgary. My current research explores the design, implementation and evaluation of novel systems for: human-AI interaction (human intention expression; AI feedback) mixed reality interfaces for collaboration and learning, prototyping ubiquitous computing environments, and interfaces for AI/robot supported activity. Broadly, I am interested in User Experience Design, Human-Computer Interaction, and the sub-disciplines of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), and Ubiquitous Computing. In my spare time, I enjoy cooking, watching cooking videos on YouTube, watching movies, and running after my kid. In my previous life (i.e. before kiddo), I was an avid video game player, volleyball player (in real life), and aspired to be an awesome programmer.",
