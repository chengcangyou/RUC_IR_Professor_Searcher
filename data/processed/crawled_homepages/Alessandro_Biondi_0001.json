In March 2017 I received the PhD in Emerging Digital Technologies (curriculum Embedded Systems) at Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, where I worked at the ReTiS Lab under the supervision of Prof. Giorgio Buttazzo. In 2016 I visited the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems - Kaiserslautern (Germany), where I worked with Björn Brandenburg. Previously, I graduated cum Laude in 2013 in Computer Engineering at University of Pisa, within the excellence program. In 2023, I received the IEEE TCCPS Early Career Award and, in 2019, I received the ACM SIGBED Early Career Award. I'm Associate Editor of IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing (TETC) Springer Real-Time Systems - The International Journal of Time-Critical Computing Systems Leibniz Transactions on Embedded Systems (LITES) I'm also a member of the Technical Committee on Factory Automation of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society, and part of the Steering Committees of the ACM SIGBED International Conference on Embedded Software (EMSOFT) and the International Conference on Real-Time Networks and Systems (RTNS). In 2018, my PhD dissertation was honored with the EDAA Outstanding Dissertation Award in the area \"New directions in software design and optimization for embedded, cyber-physical and secure systems\". I'm CTO and co-founder of Accelerat, a startup company working on software solutions for safe, secure, and predictable cyber-physical systems. In the past, I've also been a co-founder of Wriggle Solutions (IP now acquired). Research interests My research is focused on Real-Time Embedded and Cyber-Physical Systems. In particular I'm working on: Real-time operating systems: design and implementation; Cyber-security and virtualization for embedded systems; Real-time schedulability analysis; Safe and secure machine learning for CPS; Synchronization protocols.
