Previously, I was on the faculty in the Department of Computer Science at UNC Charlotte. I received my doctorate in Computer Science at Washington University in St. Louis. My research involves the application of machine learning techniques to computer vision problems. Specifically, I focus on providing intuitive methods for querying video data, with applications to biomedical image analysis and human activity understanding. This interdisciplinary research involves collaborations with architects, anthropologists, and clinicians in radiology and trauma surgery and has resulted in publications in highly-competitive venues (e.g., CVPR, ICCV, and MICCAI) and multiple best paper awards.
