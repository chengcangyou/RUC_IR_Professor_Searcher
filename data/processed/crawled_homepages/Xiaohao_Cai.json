He received his PhD degree in mathematics from The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2012. He afterwards was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Mathematics of the Technische Universitat Kaiserslautern in Germany. After that he was a Wellcome Trust Research Fellow and Isaac Newton Trust Research Fellow, affiliated with the Department of Plant Sciences, and Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge. Thenceforth, before joining Southampton, he was a Research Fellow in the Mullard Space Science Laboratory (MSSL) at University College London (UCL). >> Personal homepage click here Research Research groups Member of: Vision, Learning and Control Institute for Life Sciences Centre for Robotics Research interests Image/signal/data processing Computer vision Machine learning Optimisation Current research Xiaohao Cai has broad multi-disciplinary research interests in applied mathematics, statistics, and computer science, with main focus and applications in image/signal/data processing, computer vision, machine learning and optimisation.
