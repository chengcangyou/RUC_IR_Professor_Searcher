Jim was an active researcher in technology-enhanced learning and artificial intelligence. He held a number of grants, supervised more than 30 graduate students, and published more than 140 refereed papers. Jim’s record of administrative service to the University of Saskatchewan is highly distinguished. He was a long-standing champion of teaching and learning at USask. Jim had tremendous influence on the careers of many staff who consider themselves privileged to have worked within the scope of his influence and leadership. In his last few years, Jim found new ways to lift up the University of Saskatchewan as a leader in teaching and learning through his work as a Senior Strategist in Learning Analytics. Jim’s work in the areas of big data and early alert was outstanding and left a path for his colleagues to continue.
