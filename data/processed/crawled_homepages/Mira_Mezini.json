After completing her PhD at the University of Siegen in Germany, Mezini was an assistant professor at Northeastern University (USA) before joining TUDa in 2000. She serves on the board of the National Research Center for Applied Cybersecurity ATHENE and co-directs hessian.AI, the Hessian Center for Artificial Intelligence. Mezini held various leadership positions at TUDa, including Dean of Computer Science (2013-2014) and Vice President roles (2014-2019). She has held visiting professorships at Lancaster University (UK) and Università della Svizzera Italiana (Switzerland).Mezini has held significant roles in research funding and scientific governance. Among others, she has been member of the Computer Science Panel of the German Research Foundation (DFG) and of the Computer Science Consolidator Grant Panel of the European Research Council (ERC), of the international START / Wittgenstein Jury of the Austrian Science Fund, and of the Executive Committee of ACM SIGPLAN – Special Interest Group for Programming Languages – of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). She has also been member of the BMWi jury of experts for the EXIST Transfer of Research Program and of the supervisory board of the Cyberagency of the German Federal government. Currently, she is member of the ERC Scientific Council’s selection committee and the DFG Senate.Mezini’s research focuses on three main areas: programming systems for reliable distributed software and AI, automated software analysis, and foundational code models. With over 200 frequently cited peer-reviewed publications in top venues in software engineering and programming languages, her work has gained significant recognition. She has chaired or is chairing major software engineering and programming languages conferences (ECOOP, OOPSLA, FSE, and ICSE) and has received several awards and other recognitions for her work. Her awards include two IBM Eclipse Innovation Awards (2005 and 2006), a Google Research Award (2017), and the second prize in the Horst Görtz Foundation’s IT Security Award (2014). In 2012, Mezini received an ERC Advanced Grant, the EU’s most prestigious research funding award. A member of the German Academy of Engineering Sciences and the Academia Europaea, Mezini was recently named an ACM Fellow and elected to the National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina, further cementing her status as a leader in the field of computer science.Mira Mezini was awarded the Dahl-Nygaard Prize 2025. The prize is one of the most prestigious in the field of programming and software engineering. She is also co-spokesperson of the Excellence Cluster “Reasonable Artificial Intelligence”.
