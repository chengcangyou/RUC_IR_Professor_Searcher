At the same time, I am also a research member of the Software Engineering Group (SEG) led by Prof. Xuandong Li , my Ph.D. supervisor. I received the B.Sc. (CUMT), M.Eng. (NJU) and Ph.D. (NJU) degrees in Computer Science in 2001, 2004 and 2009, respectively. From Sep 2007 to Sep 2008, I worked in the INRIA AtlanMod team led by Prof. Jean Bézivin, my co-supervisor in France. Currently, I am working at SnT of Luxembourg University as a visiting scholar in the SVV Lab led by Prof. Lionel Briand. The visiting period is from March to September, 2013. Teaching Concepts of Computer Programming Languages, 2014 to 2023 (for undergraduates) Software Engineering, with Prof. Xuandong Li, Prof. Linzhang Wang, 2010 to 2023 (for undergraduates) Comprehensive Experiment of Software Engineering, with Prof. Chun Cao, Prof. Linzhang Wang, 2015 to 2023 (for undergraduates) Software Construction, Spring 2009 (for undergraduates). Software Methodology — Model Driven Software Development, 2009 to 2023 (for postgraduates). Research Interest My overall research interests relate to model driven aspects of software engineering, with the aim of facilitating the rapid and reliable development and maintenance of both large and small software systems. My recent work is focusing on MDE based embedded systems, including patterns driven MDE development, bridging heterogeneous models, formal support for design and analysis.
