This work includes developing languages on collections of data (tensors, relations, graphs, and objects embedded in space) and developing meta-compilers that generates compilers for different languages and machines. In particular, we have developed compilers for sparse tensor algebra and other array operations on sparse data, which lets us build tensor algebra and array libraries and languages that are polymorphic over different data structures. This work includes the TACO compiler, the Simit Programming Language, the Burrito compiler, the Distal and Legate Sparse systems, the Sparse Abstract Machine, the Etch Indexed Stream compiler, the RECUMA recurrence compiler, and the Scorch sparse extension to the PyTorch library. We have also developed the Copy-and-Patch compiler technology that makes it possible to derive from LLVM lightning fast online compilers for different ISAs, which have no runtime dependencies on LLVM. My thesis on Sparse Tensor Algebra Compilation is a good place to start reading about the ideas behind the tensor algebra compiler (taco) and sparse iteration model.
