My main research interests are in distributed systems and multi-core systems. I’m particularly interested in: Building fault-tolerant storage and database systems. Building tools to ease concurrent programming for developers. Verifying correctness of distributed systems and algorithms. I am looking for motivated PhD/MS/Undergrad students. If you are interested, email me a brief resume. News (see all) Sep 2025, AutoMan accepted to SOSP ‘25! Sep 2025, Tiga accepted to SOSP ‘25! Jul 2025, Mako appeared at OSDI ‘25!
