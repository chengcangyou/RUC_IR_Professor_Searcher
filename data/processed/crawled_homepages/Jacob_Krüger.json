Variant-rich systems exist in different customizable variants and have become the most widely existing form of software systems in all areas of society. My goal as a researcher is to improve our foundational understanding of how the respective software evolves, focusing on the interplay of human cognition and software quality. Evolving variant-rich systems is particularly challenging for developers and has been the focus of my PhD, which I obtained in 2021 from the Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg under the supervision of Prof. Thomas Leich and Prof. Gunter Saake. My dissertation (external reviewers: Prof. Jan Bosch and Prof. Rick Rabiser) focused on providing an empirics-based understanding of the re-engineering of variant-rich systems to support developers in the decision whether to rely on unsystematic or systematic software reuse. During these studies, I found that developers’ comprehension of their system is the most important factor to engineer high-quality (variant-rich) software. This topic has fascinated me ever since. Checkout my research and publications sites (also on my personal website) or ask me if you want to learn more about my research and find preprints of all my papers. If you are interested in collaborating or are looking for thesis projects in this area, please drop me a mail.
