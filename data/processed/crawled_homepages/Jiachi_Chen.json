I received my Ph.D degree at the Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Australia, under the supervision of Prof.John Grundy, Dr.Xin Xia and Dr.Jiangshan Yu. Prior to joining Monash University, I spent two years at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University as a research assistant advised by Dr. Daniel Xiapu Luo. My research interests include web3, smart contracts, LLM security, mining software repository, software security, and empirical study. Looking for highly motivated students in the areas of Web3/Blockchain/Smart Contract, LLM Security, and Software Engineering. Please contact me if you have interests.
