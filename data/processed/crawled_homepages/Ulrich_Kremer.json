He graduated with highest distinction (ausgezeichnet) with a Diplom in Informatik from the University of Bonn, Germany. He went on to receive a M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science from Rice University under the supervision of Ken Kennedy . His research interests include compilation techniques and interactive programming environments for multiprocessor systems, compiler support for power and energy management, programming models and optimizations for dynamic networks of resource constrained devices (e.g.: smart phones), and novel programming architectures for autonomous robots such as autonomous underwater vehicles.
