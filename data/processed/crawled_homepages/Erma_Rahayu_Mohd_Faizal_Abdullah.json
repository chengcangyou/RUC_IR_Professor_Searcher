ERMA RAHAYU BINTI MOHD FAIZAL ABDULLAH Department of Artificial Intelligence Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology ermaum.edu.my View CV View 1-Page CV Publons Biography I am Erma Rahayu Mohd Faizal Abdullah, the Head of the Department of Artificial Intelligence at Universiti Malaya. My passion lies in advancing the fields of computer vision, machine learning, and their applications in areas such as healthcare, education, and manufacturing. As an academic, I’ve had the privilege of shaping the AI curriculum at Universiti Malaya, including designing courses like Artificial Intelligence: Principles & Techniques and NextGen Software Development. My goal is to ensure students are equipped with the knowledge and skills to thrive in the evolving AI landscape. My research focuses on solving real-world problems through AI. One of my proudest projects is UMFit, a real-time monitoring app for cardiac patients that aims to improve healthcare accessibility and reduce clinical burdens. I’m also actively involved in using CBCT data for dentistry research and collaborating with Perodua to enhance automation and quality systems in manufacturing. Ethical AI is a significant part of my work. As an IEEE CertifAIEd™ Authorized Assessor, I focus on promoting algorithmic fairness, transparency, and privacy. I also apply explainable AI (XAI) tools, such as SHAP, to ensure my AI models are interpretable and trustworthy. Education is my passion, and I strive to empower students with high-order thinking skills and innovative approaches to learning. I also enjoy collaborating with international scholars, such as hosting Nishitani Aoi from Ehime University, and incorporating dynamic topics like intelligent agents and Data Intelligence into the curriculum. I strongly believe in building bridges between academia and industry. Collaborations with global leaders like Zhipu AI and Alto AI have brought valuable resources to my department, ensuring we remain at the forefront of AI research and innovation. I am driven by a vision of creating impactful AI solutions and nurturing the next generation of AI experts. My journey continues to be fueled by curiosity, collaboration, and a commitment to ethical innovation.
