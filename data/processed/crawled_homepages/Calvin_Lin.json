I do research in compilers and computer architecture, with interests in security. I have written a textbook with Larry Snyder called Principles of Parallel Programming. (Errata for the first printing.) More recently, Akanksha Jain and I have written a book, Cache Replacement Policies, which is part of Morgan & Claypool's Synthesis Lectures on Computer Architecture.
