After his graduation he worked as a software developer for Siemens and Trium Analysis Online. In 2007 he continued his studies of computer science under the supervision of Tom Friedetzky at Durham University. During this time he spent seven months at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver. After earning his PhD degree, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Paderborn and the University of Mainz. Since 2017 he is a lecturer at Loughborough University. Lars Nagel's main interests are in theoretical computer science and computer systems. His research focuses on combinatorial optimisation and the design and analysis of algorithms, data structures and random processes. His research has applications in cloud, edge and high-performance computing, storage systems and green computing.
