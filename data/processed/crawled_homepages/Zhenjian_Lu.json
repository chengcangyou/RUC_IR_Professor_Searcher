I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Victoria. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Warwick (hosted by Igor Carboni Oliveira), a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford (hosted by Rahul Santhanam), and a Research Fellow for the Meta-Complexity program at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing. I obtained my Ph.D. from Simon Fraser University, where I was advised by Valentine Kabanets and Andrei Bulatov. I did my Bachelor's in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia.
