Congratulations Dr. Lambert! 2025 Nov. 6th: RaphaÃ«l Perraud's work on metrics for estimating perceptual distances between interfaces and collaboration with Gilles Bailly on the the role of social interactions in the discovery of keyboard shortcuts have respectively received best Work-in-progress and best paper awards at the 36th IHM conference. Great job guys! 2025 Mar. 3rd: Looking forward to CHI 2025 in Yokohama, where Eva Mackamul will present her paper on interaction discoverability (she also received a Honorable mention award! Congrats), Alice Loizeau her TOCHI paper on interaction interferences, Xinrui Fang his Late-Breaking-Work on scientific bibliography practice, and Kazuhiro Shinoda will demonstrate his work on tactile design. I will also take part in the Meta-HCI workshop to collectively reflect on how HCI can refine its methodologies. Really can't wait! I am a research scientist (ChargÃ© de Recherche, HDR) at Inria, in the Loki group, currently visiting Prof. Koji Yatani 's' Interactive Intelligent Systems Laboratory at the University of Tokyo as a JSPS Invited fellow . Prior to that, I was a post-doctoral researcher at the University College London and at the University of Canterbury (New-Zealand). I did my Ph.D. at TÃ©lÃ©com ParisTech, and passed my Master Degree at UPMC in Artificial Intelligence with a speciality in HCI. I am also an adjunct assistant professor at the University of Waterloo, Canada (2021-2028). My research interests are in the areas of human-computer interaction (HCI), with additional focus on designing interactive systems and interaction techniques that can be easily discovered and learned by novice users, while still yielding high performance to more practiced users. More generally, I am highly interested in how interaction can be communicated to the user to foster its discovery. If you are curious about my research, giving a look at the selected recent publications below should provide a decent overview. I currently am the Principal Investigator of the ANR JCJC Discovery project (2020-2025) that investigates the design of Graphical User Interfaces that would better support the discovery of their interactive principles.
