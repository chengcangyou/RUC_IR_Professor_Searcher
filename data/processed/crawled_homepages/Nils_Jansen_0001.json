We conduct broad foundational and application-driven research. Our vision of neurosymbolic AI combines the fields of machine learning and formal methods, with a particular focus on formal verification. We tackle problems that are inspired by autonomous systems and planning problems in robotics. The following goals are central to our efforts: Increase the dependability of AI in safety-critical environments. Render AI models robust against uncertain knowledge about their environment. Enhance the capabilities of formal verification to handle real-world problems using learning techniques. We are interested in various aspects of dependability and safety in AI, intelligent decision-making under uncertainty, and safe reinforcement Learning. A key aspect of our research is a thorough understanding of the (epistemic or aleatoric) uncertainty that may occur when AI systems operate in the real world.
