Biography Dr Taylor joined The Australian National University (ANU) in January 2016. She spent the previous six months working on a UN âbig dataâ project with Australian Bureau of Statistics, after 20 years at CSIRO as a principal research scientist in the polyonymous IT research division. She has also worked as an IT practioner in consulting, publishing, education and government, in Sydney, Montreal and Oxford. Her research has focused on data management, integration, mining and machine learning in interdisciplinary contexts, especially employing logic-based and semantic approaches. Much of her recent work addresses data arising from IoT. She has lectured in logic programming, networking, software engineering and agile project management. Currently she lectures in data mining and convenes the ANU postgraduate programs in applied data analytics. From 2015-2017 she co-Chaired the joint Spatial Data on the Web working group of the W3C and the OGC.
