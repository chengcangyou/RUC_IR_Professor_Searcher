She is also a member of the Digital Education Research Group at Monash and an associate scholar of the Centre for Research in Digital Education and the Centre for Research in Education Inclusion and Diversity at the University of Edinburgh. Before joining Monash, she was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Edinburgh (2016-2020) where she had a lead role on several multi-national projects, collaborating with a wide range of partners in Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Australia. She is particularly known for her achievements on an award-winning project, SHEILA (Supporting Higher Education to integrate Learning Analytics), which has informed policy development for learning analytics in over 200 higher education institutions around the world. During her time in Edinburgh, she was affiliated with the Centre for Research in Digital Education and was first based in the Moray House School of Education and Sport before moving to the School of Informatics. Yi-Shan holds a PhD and an MPhil degree in Education from the University of Cambridge where she focused her research on children's engagement with multimodal texts including picturebooks and comic books. Prior to working in the higher education context, she worked extensively with children aged between 9 and 15 as a school teacher. Yi-Shan's current research aims to enhance learning, teaching, and educational environments with the adoption of digital and data technologies. In particular, she investigates social-technical issues and pedagogical implications around the use of data and digital technologies in education from multi-stakeholder perspectives. She is also interested in developing effective data-driven feedback and literacy based on educational theories and storytelling principles. She is one of the early pioneers on feedback analytics, which apply learning analytics techniques to track learner engagement with feedback and provide personalised support to scaffold feedback literacy. As an interdisciplinary researcher, she has research expertise in areas including learning analytics, digital education, feedback, multimodal literacy, and reading cultures. Yi-Shan has participated as a PI or co-PI in several research grants internally and externally funded grants totalling over AUD$11M. Yi-Shan is a Fellow of UK Higher Education Academy (FHEA)(Advance HE). She was an Honorary Fellow at the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh (2019 -- 2024). She served as an executive member of the Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR) between 2019 and 2024, and had the honour to hold positions including Vice President and the Communication Working Group Chair. During her service on the SoLAR committee, she started a podcast programme (SoLAR Spotlight: Conversations on Learning Analytics) and established the SoLAR ECR Grant Programme to support early career researchers.Supervision interestsAreas: social informatics, learning analytics, digital education, digital humanities Learning analytics specific topics: learning analytics-based feedback processesfeedback literacyinstitutional adoption strategy and policyapplications of storytelling methodshuman-centred learning analyticsMonash teaching commitmentFIT4005 - IT research and innovation methods FIT5125 - IT research and innovation methods FIT2002 - Project management FIT5057 - Project management FIT3174 - IT strategy and governance FIT5102 - IT strategy and governance ITO5005 - Educational theories and processes in learning analytics ITO5006 - Human-centred learning analytics Expertise related to UN Sustainable Development Goals In 2015, UN member states agreed to 17 global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all.
