AboutBiographyYunpeng Li is a Visiting Reader at the Surrey Institute for People-Centred AI (PAI). He is a Reader in AI & Digital Oral Health at King's College London. He was a Lecturer (2018-2021) and a Senior Lecturer (2021-2024) in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Surrey, a Postdoctoral Research Assistant in Machine Learning working with Steve Roberts in the Machine Learning Research Group, University of Oxford (2017-2018), and a Junior Research Fellow at Wolfson College, University of Oxford (2018). He completed his Ph.D. in electrical engineering with Mark Coates at McGill University in Montréal, Canada in 2017.His research interests are in the design and development of machine learning solutions that improve human life. His ongoing and past research efforts particularly focus on high-dimensional, data-adaptive uncertainty quantification methodologies, as well as applications in the areas of AI for health such as dental disease detection with radiography, breast cancer detection with RF sensors, and device-free target tracking in sensor networks. His work on malaria-vectoring mosquito detection using low-cost mobile phones has received media coverage from BBC, the Guardian, New Scientist, Digital Trends, and MIT Technology Review, among other venues.
