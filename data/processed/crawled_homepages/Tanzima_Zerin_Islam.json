Her research develops software tools and data-driven analysis techniques to automatically identify performance problems of scientific applications running on High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. She has received two prestigious and highly selective early-career awards: the NSF CAREER Award and the Department of Energy's (DOE) Early Career Research Program (ECRP) Award. The impact of her research has been recognized nationally and internationally through awards such as the R&D 100 award, the Science and Technology award from LLNL, and TXST's Presidential Award. DOE, NSF, TXST, AMD, and various national laboratories have generously funded Dr. Islam’s research.Dr. Islam is also the co-founder of Bangladeshi Women in Computer Science and Engineering (BWCSE)—a pioneering platform launched in 2014 to support Bangladeshi women pursuing degrees in computing. Through a combination of mentoring, research guidance, and resource sharing, BWCSE has empowered hundreds of students to elevate their scholarly achievements, connect with national and international opportunities, and launch their graduate and professional careers.
