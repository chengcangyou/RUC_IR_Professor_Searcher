My recent research interests are applied cryptography, decentralized systems, and zero-knowledge proofs.I received my CS Ph.D. at UC Berkeley RISE Lab, where I was co-advised by Raluca Ada Popa and Alessandro Chiesa.I received my Bachelor's degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2017, where I was a member of the ACM Honored Class.I am a co-author of arkworks, an ecosystem for developing and programming with zkSNARKs.Selected PublicationsDFS: Delegation-friendly zkSNARK and Private Delegation of ProversYuncong Hu, Pratyush Mishra, Xiao Wang, Jie Xie, Kang Yang, Yu Yu, Yuwen ZhangUSENIX Security 2025 (34th USENIX Security Symposium)HuRef: HUman-REadable Fingerprint for Large Language ModelsBoyi Zeng, Lizheng Wang, Yuncong Hu, Yi Xu, Chenghu Zhou, Xinbing Wang, Yu Yu, Zhouhan LinNeurIPS 2024 (38th Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems)A Succinct Range Proof for Polynomial-based Vector CommitmentRui Gao, Zhiguo Wan, Yuncong Hu, Huaqun WangCCS 2024 (31st ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security)Hadamard Product Argument from Lagrange-Based Univariate PolynomialsJie Xie, Yuncong Hu, Yu YuACISP 2024 (29th Australasian Conference on Information Security and Privacy)A Verifiable and Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning Training FrameworkHaohua Duan, Zedong Peng, Liyao Xiang, Yuncong Hu, Bo LiTDSC 2024 (IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing)Gemini: Elastic SNARKs for Diverse Environments(alphabetical order authors) Jonathan Bootle, Alessandro Chiesa, Yuncong Hu and Michele OrrùEurocrypt 2022 (41st Annual International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques)Merkle^2: A Low-Latency Transparency Log SystemYuncong Hu, Kian Hooshmand, Harika Kalidhindi, Seung Jin Yang, Raluca Ada PopaS&P 2021 (42nd IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy)Marlin: Preprocessing zkSNARKs with Universal and Updatable SRS(alphabetical order authors) Alessandro Chiesa, Yuncong Hu, Mary Maller, Pratyush Mishra, Noah Vesely, and Nicholas P.
