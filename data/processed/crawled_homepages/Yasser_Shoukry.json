Before joining UCI, I spent two years as an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park. Before that, I was a joint postdoctoral associate at the University of California, Berkeley, University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of Pennsylvania working with Prof. George J. Pappas, Prof. Sanjit A. Seshia, and Prof. Paulo Tabuada. I received my Ph.D. from the Electrical Engineering Department at the University of California, Los Angeles in 2015 under the supervision of Prof. Paulo Tabuada and Prof. Mani Srivastava. My research goal is to develop algorithms and tools to reason about the resilience, security, and privacy of Artificial Intelligence (AI) controlled Cyber-Physical Systems and Internet-of-Things (IoT), in general, and robotic systems, in particular, providing a scientific basis to understand their fundamental properties and guide their design. My work spans both theoretical and experimental aspects of CPS and draws on tools from formal methods, embedded systems, control theory, and machine learning.
