Before joining OSU, I did postdocs at UT Austin, University of Haifa, and IIT Kanpur. I completed my Ph.D. in computer science at Caltech in 2017, under Chris Umans. My research interests include pseudorandomness, coding theory, algebraic complexity theory, and applications of algebraic methods in theoretical computer science. My work is supported by the NSF CAREER Award. Research Debordering Closure Results in Determinantal and Pfaffian Ideals Anakin Dey and Zeyu Guo To appear in ITCS 2026.
