My research is in the area of cybersecurity and applied cryptography. Recently, I am working on zero-knowledge proofs, secure multiparty computations and their applications in blockchain and machine learning to enhance privacy, fairness and scalability. My research has been generously supported by the NSF CAREER award, Air Force Research Lab, DARPA, Facebook Research Award and Latticex Foundation. Before joining UIUC, I spent 4 great years at the Computer Science and Engineering department of Texas A&M University. I was a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley hosted by Dawn Song. I obtained my PhD from University of Maryland and my advisors are Charalampos Papamanthou and Jonathan Katz. I co-taught a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) on Zero-Knowledge Proofs in Spring 2023.
