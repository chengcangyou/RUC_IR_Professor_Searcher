He received an M.A. (1965) and Ph.D.(1968) in applied mathematics from Harvard University in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (then the Division of Engineering and Applied Physics). Professor Fischer's current research interests include Theory of distributed systems Crytographic protocols Electronic voting systems Theoretical issues in scalable parallel computing Analysis of algorithms and data structures Teaching Professor Fischer has recently taught CPSC 163b From Pictograph to Pixel: Changing Ways of Human Communication (was CPSC 290b; with Beatrice Gruendler and John Darnell) CPSC 223b Data Structures and Programming Techniques CPSC 427b/527b Object-Oriented Programming CPSC 435b/535b Internet-Scale Applications (with Richard Yang) CPSC 461b/561b Foundations of Cryptography CPSC 467a/567a Cryptography and Computer Security Publications His CV and publication list is available as a PDF file. Here are some old hard-to-find technical reports that are now available electronically. TR-1104: Lecture Notes on Network Complexity, June 1974. TR-416: A Robust and Verifiable Cryptographically Secure Election Scheme (Extended Abstract). Josh D. Cohen and Michael J. Fischer, July 1985. This paper subsequently appeared in Proc. 26th IEEE Sympos. Foundat. Comput. Sci. (Oct. 1985), 372-382. TR-273: The Consensus Problem in Unreliable Distributed Systems (A Brief Survey), June 1983. The following papers are available online. More are coming soon (he hopes). Appraising Two Decades of Distributed Computing Theory Research: M. J. Fischer and M. Merritt. Preprint of paper published in Distributed Computing 16:239-247, 2003. Counting Predicates of Conjunctive Complexity One: M. J. Fischer and R. Peralta, Yale TR-1222, February 2002. Optimal Layout of Edge-Weighted Forests: M. J. Fischer and M. S. Paterson. Discrete Applied Mathematics, 90 (1-3): 135-159, January 1999. Lambda-Calculus Schemata (prepublication draft): M. J. Fischer, Lisp and Symbolic Computation 6(3/4):259--288, November 1993. Downloads Along with research papers, he is also beginning to release under the GPLv3 license some programs, originally written for other purposes, in the hopes that others might find them useful. A heap implementation in C of a priority queue (download). This implementation allows multiple heaps to be created with different data types as elements and different priority rules.
