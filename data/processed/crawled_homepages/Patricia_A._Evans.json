Evans Faculty of Computer Science University of New Brunswick P.O. Box 4400, Fredericton, NB CANADA E3B 5A3 Tel: (506) 458-7276 Fax: (506) 453-3566 Office: ITC322 (Information Technology Centre) email: pevans@unb.ca For information on our graduate program, please refer to our information pages. CS4983 / CS4997 Projects Projects in Algorithms, of use to substring or substructure analysis or other aspects of Computational Biology, or relevant to other activities (such as Programming Contests) are especially welcome. I am also interested in technical reports that investigate various topics in nonstandard computing (DNA computing, membrane computing models, quantum computing or anything else unusual). Here are some suggested project descriptions. They can be customized and scaled appropriately. 2020-21 Teaching Activities On Sabbatical. Research Interests Computational Biology, Algorithm Design and Analysis, Bioinformatics, Problem Analysis, Computational Complexity, Parameterized Complexity, Learning Theory, Graph Theory Past and current projects include the design and implementation of algorithms for RNA comparison using secondary structures, haplotype inference for pedigrees, biological network comparison, and parallelization techniques for dynamic programming. See my research page for more information about the activities of my research group, and this partial list of publications from the DBLP Biobliography Server.
