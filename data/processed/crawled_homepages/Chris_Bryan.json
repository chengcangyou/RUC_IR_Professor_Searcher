Are you a student interested in Vis research? Read the Lab Policies page first! CV (last updated January 2025) About I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence at Arizona State University, which is located in the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering at Arizona State University. I lead the Sonoran Visualization Laboratory (SVL @ ASU). I am also an affiliate faculty with ASU's Global Security Initiative. I received my Ph.D. at the University of California, Davis as a part of the VIDi lab. My research spans the areas of data visualization, human-computer interaction, augmented and virtual reality, and data science. Broadly, I develop novel algorithms, models, techniques, and interaces that help humans make sense of data. My research group regularly works with complex and real-world data, and develops advanced interactive visual analytics and data pipelines, including exploring advanced data in new ways, modeling and interpreting machine learning and artificial intelligence, and explaining or storytelling with data. See the Research page for more details, and the Publications page for our group's published papers.

Recent News September 2025 We have one paper accepted to this year's IEEE VIS conference, by first year PhD student Zhuojun Jiang: The Hue-Man Factor: An Empirical Evaluation of Visualization Perception and Accessibility Across Color Vision Profiles, and three papers, led by recently graduated MS students Shubham Chawla and Utkarsh Singh, accepted to HICSS 2026. April 2025 We have two papers accepted to this year's EuroVis 2025 conference: Modeling and Measuring the Chart Communication Recall Process and VeCNA: Visual Exploration, Comparison and Analysis of Reconstructed Spatiotemporal Scientific Simulation Data. We were awarded an Honorable Mention in this year's PacificVis Visual Data Storytelling Contest for our shortlisted entry entitled The Story of Wagyu: Bringing Charm of Japan's Pride to the World (link). 🏆🇯🇵🐄 January 2025 We had two papers accepted this month: (1) PromptAid: Visual Prompt Exploration, Perturbation, Testing and Iteration for Large Language Models has been accepted to IEEE Transactions in Visualization and Computer Graphics. This paper develops a human-in-the-loop pipeline to support iteratively prompting LLMs. (2) Lost in Translation: How Does Bilingualism Shape Reader Preferences for Annotated Charts? has been accepted to CHI 2025. This study explores how presenting annotated text on top of visualizations in different languages (e.g., Arabic and Tamil) impacts reader preferences and cognition for users who are non-native English speakers. December 2024 My former students Drs. Jinbin Huang and Anjana Arunkumar walked at the Fall 2024 Convocation (picture). Dr. Arunkumar also received the Dean's Dissertation Award. 🏆 This is the highest honor that can be bestowed on a graduating Ph.D. student in ASU's Fulton Schools of Engineering, and recognizes excellence in research, innovation, and potential for societal impact. Anjana was the only student from SCAI to receive this honor, and it is well deserved based on the fantastic work she did here in the SVL! September 2024 Huge congratulations to Drs. Aditi Mishra and Jinbin Huang, who both successfully defended their dissertations this month! Dr. Mishra's dissertation, entitled Unlocking Artificial Intelligence: Interactive Visualizations for Novice Users to Explore, Understand, and Trust, and Dr. Huang's dissertation, entitled Understand AI and Go Beyond: Designing Interactive Visual Analytics Systems for Efficient Deep Learning Interpretability and Development, both develop several advanced techniques and tools for interrogating AI models and processes. 👨‍💻 📊 🧠 Dr. Mishra will soon join Fujitsu Research as a Research Scientist, and Dr. Huang will join Epsilon as a Data Scientist. Congratulations to both of you, and all your hard work in our group!!! 🎉 🎉 🎉 We will have a paper at this year's International Workshop on Data Analysis and Reduction for Big Scientific Data (DRBSD, co-located with Supercoputing 2024). The work, entitled Filling the Void: Data-Driven Machine Learning-Based Reconstruction of Sampled Spatiotemporal Scientific Simulation Data, is based on research Aditi conducted with scientists Los Alamos National Laboratory. August 2024 Led by my SCAI colleague Rakibul Hasan, I'll be part of an NSF SaTC EDU project to study novel technology-enhanced pedagogies for privacy education: NSF #2350036: Investigating the Role of Storytelling Visualization in Privacy Education (link). July 2024 We will have two full papers at this year's IEEE VIS conference: Mind Drifts, Data Shifts: Utilizing Mind Wandering to Track the Evolution of User Experience with Data Visualizations, led by recent SVL graduate Anjana Arunkumar, and Defogger: A Visual Analysis Approach for Data Exploration of Sensitive Data Protected by Differential Privacy, conducted in collaboration with Nankai University in Tianjin, China. I have received a \"2024 Top Five Percent Faculty at the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering\" award. 🏆 June 2024 Kannak has been awarded a Fulton Schools of Engineering MORE position for the Fall semester. Congrats Kannak! 🥳 May 2024 Anjana successfully defended her dissertation, 🦆 The D.U.C.K. Bridge: Empowering Non-Experts in Data Visualization 🦆. A huge congratulations to Dr. Arunkumar, who will begin a PostDoc at Northeastern University this summer! 🥳 🥳 🥳 August 2023 Michael's paper Comparing Collaborative Visualization Behaviors in Desktop and Augmented Reality Environments has been accepted to ACM VRST 2023. We explored how two-person teams (aka, dyads) communicate and interact when using Hololenses to analyze 3D visualizations in augmented reality. July 2023 Anjana's paper Image or Information? Examining the Nature and Impact of Visualization Perceptual Classification has been accepted to IEEE VIS 2023. This project explores how we cognitively internalize data visualizations: as images, or as information? We created a dataset of 500 annotated visualizations and then conducted a pair of large-scale experiments to investigate the nature of such internalization and explore how memory encoding affects it retrieval. This work was done in collaboration with fellow ASU professor Gi-Yeul Bae and Northeastern professor Lace Padilla. June 2023 Congrats to Anjana, Aditi, and Jinbin on passing their comprehensive exams and dissertation proposals this spring! 🎉  🎉  🎉 Lots of good work going on in the SVL right now!
