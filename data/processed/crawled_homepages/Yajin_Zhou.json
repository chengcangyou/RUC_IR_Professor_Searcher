You need enough pizza and Diet Coke to stick in your refrigerator, a cheap PC to work on, and the dedication to go through with it.\" â John Carmack About I am a ZJU 100âYoung Professor at the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from North Carolina State University in 2015 (Advisor: Prof. Xuxian Jiang) and subsequently served as a Senior Security Researcher at Qihoo 360. I am also a coâfounder of BlockSec, a company providing blockchain security and compliance solutions. I have published 70+ papers with 10,000+ citations (see Google Scholar). One of my papers was included in the normalized list of Topâ100 Security Papers since 1981, and I received the Most Influential Scholar Award for contributions to Security and Privacy. I currently serve as Chief Scientist (PI) of a National Key R&D Program funded by China's Ministry of Science and Technology, a PC member/reviewer for IEEE S&P, USENIX Security, and ACM CCS, and an expert reviewer for funding programs in Singapore, France, and Hong Kong. AtâaâGlance 70+ publications; 10,000+ citations Topâ100 influential security paper (normalized list) Most Influential Scholar Award (Security & Privacy) PI/Chief Scientist, National Key R&D Program PC: IEEE S&P, USENIX, CCS, FC Funding program reviewer: Singapore, France, Hong Kong Founding BlockSec, a blockchain security and compliance startup company backed by top-tier investors and serving 500+ global clients including exchanges, regulators, and enterprises. Research My research spans system and blockchain security, including software security, operating system security, and hardware-assisted security, with an increasing focus on emerging areas such as smart-contract security, DeFi security, and the underground cybercrime. I continue to advance problems across traditional system security while building end-to-end protection for modern blockchain ecosystems. Impact Many of my academic results have been adopted into productionânot only at BlockSec, but earlier at Qihoo 360. This includes our early Android security work that advanced mobile security: techniques for malware detection and anti-repackaging/anti-piracy were productized and deployed at scale. Our blockchain research has helped prevent multi-million-dollar attacks and support on-chain investigations for regulators and law-enforcement worldwide. A tight two-way loop between industry and academia turns security incidents and real-world needs into sharper research questions, while academic inquiry abstracts root causes and opens new directions that feed back into productsâsustaining true academy-industry synergy.
