On the abstract end, I work on coalgebra -- a unifying theory for the analysis of various transition systems and automata, based on category theory -- and in particular on behavioural semantics, traces, and the combination of probability and nondeterminism. On the more concrete side, I work on probabilistic systems (probabilistic automata) and concurrency theory.  Among my contributions to probabilistic systems, is also my work on convex algebras.My interests are broad: I have also contributed to engineering areas in computer science like memory management and real-time systems, and I have made a contribution to security on probabilisitc anonimity. The most exciting research that I worked on, besides coalgebra, is on concurrent data structures and their semantics.Some (recent) community activities:          • PC member for FoSSaCS'24, iFM'23, TbiLLC'23, MFPS'23, QUALOG'23, ESOP'23, CSL'23, RAMiCS'23, CAV’22, CONCUR’22, CSL’22, FORMATS’22, FORTE’22, FoSSaCS’22, MPC’22, TbiLLC’22, POPL’21, FACS’21, MFCS’21, FASE’20, CONCUR’20, FORMATS’20, MFPS’20, CMCS’20, TTCS’20, FoSSaCS’19, FM’19, FORTE’19, FORMATS’19, LICS’18, CONCUR’18, CMCS’18, VMCAI’18, RTEST’18, QAPL’18, ERC member of ISMM’18, PC member of CAV’17, CALCO’17, MFPS’17, FORMATS’17, FORTE’17, FMCAD’17, ICE’17, ICTI’17, QAPL’17, ERC member of CAV’16, PC member of CONCUR’16, FM’16, ICTI’16, ICE’16, CONCUR’15, CALCO’15, ICE’15, PSC’14 (PC co-chair), CMCS’14, FORMATS’14, FORTE’14, ICE’14 (PC co-chair and ICEcreamer), MFPS XXIX, ICE'13 (PC co-chair and ICEcreamer), CMCS'12, ICE'12 (ICEcreamer), CORCS'12, ICE'11, CORCS'11, ICE'10, ICE'09, CORCS'09, DATICS'09, DTVCS'09, CORCS'08, DATICS'08, DTVCS'08, co-organizer of Coalgebra Day 2006, helped in the local organization of EuroSys 2011 • (Co-)Organizer of Dagstuhl Seminar 22492 - Formal Methods and Distributed Computing: Stronger Together             December 4 - 9, 2022          • PC chair of MFPS’21.
