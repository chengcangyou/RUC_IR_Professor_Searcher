Summa Cum Laude, Tufts University, Medford, United States Biography Mark Hempstead is a Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Tufts University. His research group, the Tufts Computer Architecture Lab, investigates methods to increase energy efficiency across the boundaries of circuits, architecture, and systems. His research has been applied to a range of platforms from embedded systems, IoT, chip multiprocessors, and high performance computing. Currently, they are exploring systems support for machine learning; design exploration of non-volatile memories; contention and memory management; thermal hotspots on chip; the security implications of the thermal-side channel; methods to automatically generate shared hardware accelerators from source code; privacy-aware databases; and quantum computer architecture or ion-trap systems. He leads an interdisciplinary effort applying engineering tools to human subject's research such as education. His group has published in several different research communities including high-performance computer architecture, workload characterization, design automation, mobile-systems, embedded systems, quantum computing, and Internet-of-Things (IoT).Dr. Hempstead received a BS in Computer Engineering from Tufts University and his MS and Ph.D. in Engineering from Harvard University, working with Professors David Brooks and Gu-Yeon Wei. Prior to joining Tufts University in 2015, he was an Assistant Professor at Drexel University. He received the NSF CAREER award in 2014. He was honored for his achievements in teaching with the 2014 Drexel University Allen Rothwarf Award for Teaching Excellence given to one junior faculty member a year. He was the winner of the industry-sponsored SRC student design contest in 2006 and Best Paper Nominee in HPCA 2012. He has spent time in the research divisions of Intel, ARM, and, more recently, at Facebook FAIR SysML as a visiting research scientist. He is a Senior Member of the IEEE and the ACM.",
