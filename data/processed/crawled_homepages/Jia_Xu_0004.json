Previously, I served as an Associate Professor at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and as an Assistant Professor and Ph.D. advisor at Tsinghua University. I earned my Ph.D. from RWTH Aachen University under Prof. Hermann Ney, with research visits to Microsoft Research and IBM Watson. My work includes approximately 50 publications, 12 patents and provisional patents, and contributions to 18 top-ranking teams in major NLP competitions, including second place in the Amazon Alexa Prize Social Bot Challenge. I am currently a Visiting Professor at Rutgers University, advancing collaborative research while continuing my faculty role at Stevens Institute of Technology.
