Prior to joining Zhejiang University, I was a Chief Expert of the Software Engineering Application Technology (2021 - 2025) and the director of Software Engineering Application Technology Lab (2021 - 2024) at Huawei, China. I got my Ph.D degree in June 2014 from the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, China. I was very fortunate to work under the supervision of Prof. Xiaohu Yang and Prof. Jianling Sun. From July 2012 to January 2014, I was a visiting student of Prof. David Lo at Singapore Management University. I am an ACM Distinguished Member and received the ACM SIGSOFT Early Career Researcher Award in 2022. To help developers and testers improve their productivity, my current research focuses on data science for software engineering, i.e., mining and analyzing rich data in software repositories to uncover interesting and actionable information. I have employed and customized structured and unstructured data analytics techniques – including data mining, information retrieval, natural language processing, search-based algorithms, and program analysis – to transform passive software engineering data into automated tools and new insights.
