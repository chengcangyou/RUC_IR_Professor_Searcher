His research in nonlinear and stochastic dynamics of complex systems focuses on adaptive biological systems, especially evolution and the brain. Methods range from nonlinear dynamics and applied mathematics to statistical physics, control theory, delay equations, information theory, and neural and evolutionary computation. Evolutionary dynamics in finite populations and neural models related to consciousness and sleep have been major lines of research, complemented by complex systems approaches and data science methodology. He is also interested in socio-economic systems and network science, including unraveling what comprises complexity of networks and how to define complexity of a graph.
