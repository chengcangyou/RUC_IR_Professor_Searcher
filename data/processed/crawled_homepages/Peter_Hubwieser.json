His novel didactical approach triggered the introduction of computer science as a compulsory subject at Bavarian college preparatory high schools (Gymnasium) in 2004. After studying mathematics and physics Professor Hubwieser taught at high schools until 2001. In 1995 he completed his doctoral studies (Dr. rer. nat.) at LMU Munich and in 2000 acquired his postdoctoral teaching qualification (habilitation) at TUM. In 2003 he was appointed to a professorship position at TUM. He has been visiting professor at the universities of Klagenfurt, Salzburg and Innsbruck. Within the German Informatics Society (Gesellschaft für Informatik – GI) he set up the special interest group \"Teachers of Computer Science” in 1998. He has been a member of various boards including the steering committee of GI. He is a member of working group 3.1. of the International Federation for Information Processing. In 2007 the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder in the Federal Republic of Germany (KMK) commissioned him with the development of a core curriculum for teacher education in computer science. In 2017, he was appointed by the Bavarian State Government to the position of spokesperson for the area “Education” at the Center Digitisation.Bavaria.
