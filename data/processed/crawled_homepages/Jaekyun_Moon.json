He has since successfully established lab's international visibility and reputation through innovative research and commercialization efforts in signal processing and coding related to achieving high-density storage and high-rate communications. In 2009, he relocated his lab to the EE department at KAIST and is currently continuing research in communications, storage and machine learning. His current research emphasizes on how to design coding schemes geared to distributed and decentralized forms of machine learning and data storage/management. His recent interests include distributed/federated computing and learning as well as innovative learning algorithms for low-data and hardware-complexity constrained applications.
