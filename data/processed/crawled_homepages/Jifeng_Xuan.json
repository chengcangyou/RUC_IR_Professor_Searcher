Wuhan University was founded in 1893, which locates in Wuhan, a central city of China. The city of Wuhan has a long history of 3,500 years with a current population of over 10 million people. Here is his official homepage at Wuhan University. He is the founder of CSTAR - Centre of Software Testing, Analysis and Reliability. He was a postdoctoral researcher at SPIRALS Team in INRIA Lille - Nord Europe in France. He has co-worked with Dr. Martin Monperrus and Prof. Lionel Seinturier. He received the bachelor degree and the PhD degree at OSCAR Lab, School of Software, Dalian University of Technology, China. His PhD supervisor is Prof. He Jiang. Before university, he graduated from Harbin No. 3 High School, Harbin, China. He is a member of ACM, IEEE, and CCF (China Computer Federation). His research interest is Software Analysis and Testing, including software testing and debugging, software data analysis, and search based software engineering. The research group is looking for PhD students and master students, who have interests in software engineering. Self-motivated bachelor students are also warmly welcomed.
