I was previously an Assistant/Associate Professor in the Computer Science department at Oklahoma State University. I received my B.A. from Macalester College and my Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota. I am privileged to have worked with Professor Nick Hopper as my adviser. I joined Loyola University Chicago in August 2018 to lead the cybersecurity program. Loyola University Chicago has been designated as a NSA National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense (NCAE-C) in June 2020, and in 2025, re-designated until 2030. I am the PI for the NCAE-C at Loyola and the Founding Director of the Loyola Center for Cybersecurity. My research and education and outreach efforts have been funded by NSF (3 awards), NSA/NCAE (2 awards), DoD, and industry such as Halliburton, Motorola Solutions Foundation (3 years), and Dr. Scholl Foundation (4 awards). From July 2020 to August 2022, I was the Graduate Program Director (GPD) for the MS in Computer Science and MS in Software Engineering programs. As GPD, I significantly updated the MS curriculum in Computer Science: 1) adding program prerequisites to prepare non-CS undergraduate majors to enter the MS program, and 2) adding three new concentrations in Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, and Computer Systems. From August 2022 to June 2024, I was the faculty Director for the Fellowship Office. Please visit the Fellowship Office website for more information. I am always looking for motivated students (undergraduate, M.S., Ph.D.) to work with me in the research areas below. E-mail me or stop by my office. Also, consider enrolling in one of my classes for Fall or Spring. Undergraduate students should also consider applying for the CAS USRE/Mulcahy or the LUROP programs. If you are a current or prospective student in the MS in Cybersecurity program, please contact gpdcyber@cs.luc.edu If you are looking for more information about the NSF CyberRamblers Scholarship for Service program, please click here.
