I am also affiliated with UMD's MC2 and UMIACCS. Previously, I was research faculty at Boston University. I got my PhD from Johns Hopkins University in 2020, under the supervision of my advisors Avi Rubin and Matt Green. I am an observant Jew, which may affect when I can respond to your emails. A copy of my CV is available here. If you came to this website expecting stuff about the placebo effect or alternative medicine, you may be looking for my father's website. If you are interested in working with me as a PhD student, take a look at this blog post! If you are interested in my work on usability and DP, you may also be interested in this position my colleagues and I just posted! An Occasional Blog I have started an occasional blog here. My latest post is some thoughts about common mistakes I've noticed recently while reviewing for security and crypto conferences. My hope is that it can be helpful to students writing papers for these venues. MPC FAQ I have compiled an FAQ about secure multiparty computation (MPC) aimed at non-experts. The FAQ can be found here. If you notice some way in which it can be improved, please send me an email! 2025 Updates I'm on parental leave for the next couple of months. A collaborative NSF proposal was rejected. Updates from previous years can be found here.
