Follow Hoboken, NJ, USA jhong8@stevens.edu ResearchGate Twitter LinkedIn Google Scholar I am an assistant professor in Computer Science at Stevens Institute of Technology. My research interest is about addressing the real-world problems using human-computer interaction and machine learning techniques. I build machine learning applications and investigate interactions between a user and the application using quantitative and qualitative analysis. In my recent projects, I explored the challenges of identifying errors from speech recognizer and conducted user studies to facilitate machine teaching with a teachable object recognizer for non-experts. ProjectsThe overarching theme of my research is designing and evaluating accessible interactions with emerging technologies such as wearables and AI-infused applications.
