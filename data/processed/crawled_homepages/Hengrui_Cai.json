I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Statistics at North Carolina State University (NCSU), co-advised by Dr. Wenbin Lu and Dr. Rui Song. Prior to that, I obtained a B.S. in Statistics from Zhejiang University in July 2017. I have broad research interests in methodology and theory in causal inference, reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and their interchanges, to establish reliable, powerful, and interpretable solutions to wide real-world problems. Currently, my main research work includes individualized optimal decision making with complex data, policy evaluation in reinforcement learning and bandits, natural language processing and explainable deep learning, and causal discovery for high-dimensional individual mediation analysis, directly motivated by precision medicine, customized economics, personalized marketing, modern epidemiology, etc. Click here for my name in Chinese and how to pronounce it.
