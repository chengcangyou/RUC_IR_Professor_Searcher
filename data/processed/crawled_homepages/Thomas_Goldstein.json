My research focuses on responsibly building AI systems and draws on ideas from signal processing and applied mathematics. I work at the boundary between theory and systems, leveraging mathematical foundations and efficient hardware to improve the training, fine-tuning, benchmarking, and robustness of large models. I have been the recipient of several awards, including SIAM’s DiPrima Prize, a DARPA Young Faculty Award, and a Sloan Fellowship. For students I teach courses in discrete mathematics and optimization. View course webpages Sponsors My research is made possible by the generous support of the following organizations.",
