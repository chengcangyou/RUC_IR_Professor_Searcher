I teach my students to build enterprise level applications and how to use AI techniques in research and real world projects. I am looking for talented graudate students who are motivated to pursue a master's or a ph.d. degree. Normally I recruit graduate students from our master's program. If you are interested, please talk with me during my office hour. My current projects: Genetic Report Counseiling AI: collaborate with ebogenes.com, we developed a AI chat bot to answer the patientâs queries about their genetic testing report. A genetic testing report is over 2000 pages that cover all the aspects about health, ancestry, drugs, etc. You can access the AI Genetic Consultant page here and the Ebogenes AI Product Assistant here. City Getaway: collaborate with Montreal based Concord Tours, we are building a smart travel platform for Free Independent Traveller. Via chatting, our smart planner can generate itinerary from our domain knowledge base. At travel time, our smart travel assistant can provide guide information, real time alerts, and adaptation of itinerary. We have reached the top level in the tourism industry. The final product will be in the market by the end of 2025. Supported by MITACS. You can try our AI enabled travel plan here . Quebec Bus tours: collaborate with Concord Tours, we developed a software system that supports the travel agency, the guide, and the travelers during bus tours. The travelers can use their mobile phones to access the tour information, chat, and the guideâs announcement. It is under testing and trail usage. Supported by MITACS. office hour: Sabbatical 6.2025-5.2026. Contact me via phone or email.
