I am a Professor at Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of Seoul National University, Korea. I am also leading the Knowledge Discovery and Database Research Laboratory at Seoul National University. Before that, I was an Assistant Professor at Computer Science Department of KAIST (Korea), a member of technical staff (MTS) at Bell Laboratories (Murray Hill) and a research staff at IBM Almaden Research Center (San Jose). In Bell Laboratories, I was a key contributor with Rajeev Rastogi to the Serendip data mining project and, in IBM Almaden Research Center, I was a member of Quest Data Mining project led by Rakesh Agrawal. I have visited Data Management, Exploration & Mining group in Microsoft Research as a visiting scientist for the summer/winter breaks of 2001 and 2002. I also worked as a summer intern mentored by Surajit Chaudhuri at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories for two summers in 1992 and 1993. I received a Ph.D under the supervision of Professor Timos Sellis in Computer Science from University of Maryland at College Park in 1993. I received B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Seoul National University in 1986, and MS degree in Computer Science from University of Maryland at College Park in 1988. My graduate study was supported by University of Maryland at College Park and Korean Government Overseas Full Merit Scholarship. I am an Editor-In-Chief of the VLDB Journal, a Director of the ACM SIGKDD Executive Committee, a DASFAA Steering Committee Chair and a PAKDD Steering Commitete member. I was previously a member of the VLDB Endowment Board of Trustees and an Associate Editor for the IEEE TKDE, VLDB as well as PVLDB journals. I am a General Chair of ACM SIGKDD 2026 as well as ACM SIGMOD 2028 conferences, and served as a Program Co-chair for PAKDD 2003, WWW 2014, ICDE 2015, APWeb 2016, BigComp 2019 and ICDM 2019 conferences. I have been serving on Program Committees of the leading database and data mining conferences including SIGMOD, SIGKDD, ICDE, ICDM, EDBT, VLDB, AAAI, WWW, WSDM and CIKM. I became an ACM fellow and an IEEE fellow for the contributions to scalable data mining and query processing in 2013 and 2019 respectively. I served as the president of the Korean Institute of Information Scientist and Engineers (KIISE) in 2022 and became a member of National Academy of Engineering of Korea in 2023. I have been working in the area of data mining, machine learning, privacy preservation, query processing, query optimization, data warehousing, semi-structured data (XML), stream data and histograms.
