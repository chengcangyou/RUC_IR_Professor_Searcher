Prior to SJTU, I spent two years in SenseBrain located in New Jersey, and one year in JD Group Silicon Valley Research Center. I obtained my B.E. degree in Beihang University and Ph.D. degree of Computer Science from College of Computing and Informatics, UNC Charlotte. My research topics include: pathology image analysis, LLM in medical domain, and multi-modality decision making. I am recruiting students. If you have a purposeless curiosity about this world, feel free to contact me. news Sep 26, 2024 A paper in NeurIPS 2024. Emmmmmm Canada once more?
