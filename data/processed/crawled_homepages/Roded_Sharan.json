We are also interested in applications of these techniques to studying ancient texts. Example projects include: Inferring subnetworks that underlie a biological process of interest by integrating protein network data with gene expression or phenotypic information (see 1, 2). Modeling mutational processes in cancer using machine learning techniques (see 1, 2). Construction and analysis of Boolean network models using machine learning and integer programming techniques (see 1, 2). Predicting drug properties and their applications in the clinical practice (see 1, 2). Selected Web-Servers / Software: * WebPropagate * ANAT * NetworkBLAST",
