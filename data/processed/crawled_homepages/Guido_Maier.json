From 1995 until February 2006 he has been a researcher at CoreCom (research consortium supported by Pirelli and PoliMi in Milan, Italy), where he achieved the position of Head of the Optical Networking Laboratory. In March 2006 he joined the Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering (DEIB) at PoliMi as Assistant Professor. In January 2015 he became Associate Professor in the same department (permanent position – public employee – after passing a nation-wide Italian “Abilitazione” competition in 2012). In June 2021 he obtained the National Scientific Qualification to function as Full Professor in Italian Universities (“Abilitazione Scientifica Nazionale – Prof. Ordinario”). At the School of Information Engineering at PoliMi, he has been teaching several courses in the area of networking, both for undergraduate and master students. Currently, he teaches “Fundamentals of communications and Internet” at the undergrad level, and “Network Automation” and “Lab Experience” for graduate level. In 2022/2023, Maier kept the PhD course “Switching Architectures and Forwarding Algorithms” (5 credits) (in English language) within the PhD program “INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY” at PoliMI. He furthermore has kept and is keeping topical courses for employees and executives of various ICT companies, such as: Pirelli, Telecom Italia, Italtel, Nokia Siemens Networks, Sirti, Metroweb, Alcatel, SM Optics, Ericsson, ATM SpA, FIberCop. Topics of these courses have been, for example: Metro Ethernet, Passive Optical Networks, MPLS, Optical Transport Networks, Software Defined Networking. He has been Director of the course “Skill development for IT managers” organized by Cefriel and Politecnico di Milano for ATM S.P.A. (2017-2018). He has been invited lecturer in several venues and universities abroad, including: Summer Schools for PhD students of EU projects e-Photon/ONe+ and BONE; Faculté Polytecnique de Mons, Belgium; University College London, UK; University of Texas at Dallas, USA; Centre Tecnològic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), Barcellona, Spain; Poznan University of Technology, Poland; Université Pierre et Marie Curie – Sorbonne Université, Paris, France. He has participated in several joint research projects with industrial partners (Pirelli, Telecom Italia, Fastweb, RFI, BTO). He was principal investigator and research responsible for PoliMi of industrial contracts with ATM (2023-2024 and 2019-2021) and has been in the same position for a PoliMi research contract with TIM for two years (2013-2014). He has been involved in the IST-FP6 and FP7 European Projects: MUPBED, NOBEL2, e-Photon/ONe+, BONE, STRONGEST, (IRSES) MobileCloud. He has also been involved in the EIT-ICT project SOFNETS and in several Italian National research projects (Progetti di Ricerca di Interesse Nazionale – PRIN) funded by the Italian Ministry of University and Research, the most recent of which has been ROAD-NGN. He has been recently involved as the leader of the PoliMi team in the H2020 EU project METRO-HAUL (2017-2020) and is the Principal Investigator of the project WatchEDGE (2023-2025) within the framework RESTART, funded by NextGenerationEU.
