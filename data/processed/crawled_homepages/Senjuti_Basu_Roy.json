Do not tarry. To go forward is to move toward perfection. March on, and fear not the thorns, or the sharp stones on life's path. â Kahlil Gibran About Me I am the Panasonic Endowed Chair in Sustainability and an Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. At NJIT, I am the director of BDAL (Big Data Analytics Lab). Prior to that, I held a position at the Institute of Technology at the University of Washington Tacoma, and was a postdoctoral fellow at DIMACS at Rutgers University before that. I have received my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Arlington in May 2011. Earlier, I graduated from the University of Texas at Arlington in May 2007 with the M.S. degree in Computer Science (CSE@UTA). I have recieved my undergraduate B.Tech degree(2004) in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Calcutta, India. Research Interests My research interest lies at the intersection of data management, information retrieval, and AI, with three integrated thrusts: Model Reusability: Designing storage, indexing, and metadata management techniques that make pretrained AI models easily discoverable, composable, and adaptable across diverse tasks, with provable qualitative guarantees. Responsible Data Management: Advancing methods for collecting, storing, processing, and governing structured and vectorized data to ensure accuracy, trustworthiness, ethical integrity, and compliance with legal and societal requirements. Human-in-the-Loop Decision Support: Creating scalable decision-support systems for national security applications, integrating Generative AI and applied machine learning for predictive maintenance and cyber defense under stringent performance, security, and resource constraints. My work is funded by: NSF, ONR, NIH, Microsoft Research, and Multicare Health Systems. Open Position: I have an opening for a postdoctoral researcher position funded by a DoD project. The initial appointment is for 1 year, with the possibility of renewal for 2 additional years based on performance. Please apply here. News â¨NEW!!
