I completed my D.Phil degree (2016.10-2020.09) in the Department of Computer Science at University of Oxford, supervised by Profs. Niki Trigoni and Andrew Markham. Prior to Oxford, I obtained an M.Phil degree from The University of Hong Kong and a B.Eng degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. In my D.Phil study, I interned at the Augumented Reality team of Amazon (Palo Alto, CA). In my M.Phil study, I interned at Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute. In my undergraduate study, I was an exchange student at Universitat Politècnica de València (Valencia, Spain). Email / vLAR Group / Google Scholar / Github/ Xiaohongshu(小红书) Research I lead the Visual Learning and Reasoning (vLAR) Group, focusing on the fundamental research problems in machine learning, computer vision, and robotics. Our research goal is to build intelligent systems which endow machines to recover, understand, and eventually interact with the real 3D world. This includes accurate and efficient recognition, segmentation and reconstruction of all individual objects within large-scale 3D scenes. Openings (Jul 2025 - ): Several fully funded PostDoc/PhD/RA positions for 3D vision and robot learning are available now. Email me with your CV and transcripts! (All emails/CVs are carefully read and evaluated. Only matched candidates will be responded.)

DPhil (PhD) Thesis Learning to Reconstruct and Segment 3D Objects B. Yang Oxford Research Archive (PDF), 2020; (News: 机器之心报道) Thesis committee (Transfer/Confirmation/Viva): Alessandro Abate, Andrew Davison, Pawan Kumar, Andrew Zisserman. This thesis aims to understand scenes and the objects within them by learning general and robust representations using deep neural networks, trained on large-scale real-world 3D data. In particular, the thesis makes three core contributions from object-level 3D shape estimation from single or multiple views to scene-level semantic understanding.
