Bio and Research Information Clark Elliott, PhD, has been a professor of Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science at DePaul University for more than thirty years. He holds three teaching certificates for music, the B.M., M.M. (music), and M.S. (computer science) degrees, and a Ph.D. from Northwestern University's Institute for the Learning Sciences with an emphasis on AI simulations of human emotion. As a performing artist he studied at the Eastman School of Music, DePaul, and part time at the Juilliard School. Among his teachers are William Vacchiano (New York), Claude Gordon (Los Angeles) and Don Haas (San Francisco). Dr. Elliott has presented dozens of papers on computational models of emotion, on believable software agents, on the automated generation of stories under computational control, on computational models of personality and on cognitive neuroscience. He was one of the first academics to develop process models of Intelligent Agents. He is the author of The Ghost in My Brain: How a Concussion Stole My Life and How the New Science of Brain Plasticity Helped Me Get it Back. Via T.V. and radio interviews he has spoken to more than ten million people about the new neuroscience of brain plasticity. Dr. Elliott founded the Distributed Systems master's program at DePaul, and taught what may have been the first graduate-level course on web technologies in the world. He is one of the founding contributing members of DePaul's neuroscience program, and is a founding faculty member of DePaul's Artificial Intelligence program. As a professor, Dr. Elliott has developed and taught thirty-eight different courses in computer science, cognitive science and ethics with an emphasis on symbolic artificial intelligence and cognitive modeling. During Professor Elliott's tenure, DePaul CDM has grown from a department with 11 faculty members to become one of the largest graduate programs in computer science in the world. Research Area Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision Specific Research Area Artificial Intelligence models of human emotion. Computational models of personality, believable agents, personality and story generation. Cognitive neuroscience.
