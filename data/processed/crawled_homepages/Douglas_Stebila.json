My research focuses on improving the security of Internet cryptography protocols such as SSL/TLS and SSH, and developing practical quantum-resistant cryptosystems. Research My research interests include: Applied cryptography: key exchange protocols; post-quantum cryptography; digital signatures; public key encryption; client puzzles / proofs of work; elliptic curve cryptography; quantum cryptography Internet security: network security protocols (SSL/TLS, SSH, Tor, â¦); public key infrastructure (PKI); authentication My full list of publications and presentations are available online. My most recent papers are: On the multi-target security of post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms L. Glabush, K. HÃ¶velmanns, D. Stebila. 2025. Hybrid key exchange in TLS 1.3 D. Stebila, S. Fluhrer, S. Gueron. Internet-Draft, September 2025. Hybrid obfuscated key exchange and KEMs F. GÃ¼nther, M. Rosenberg, D. Stebila, S. Veitch. In CRYPTO 2025. Verifiable decapsulation: recognizing faulty implementations of post-quantum KEMs L. Glabush, F. GÃ¼nther, K. HÃ¶velmanns, D. Stebila. In CRYPTO 2025. KEM-based pre-shared-key handshakes for TLS 1.3 T. Wiggers, S. Celi, P. Schwabe, D. Stebila, N. Sullivan. Internet-Draft, April 2025. KEM-based authentication for TLS 1.3 T. Wiggers, S. Celi, P. Schwabe, D. Stebila, N. Sullivan. Internet-Draft, April 2025. Pictures I'm fortunate to be able to travel a lot. I take lots of pictures on my trips. The best of my photos are posted in my galleries. My most recent galleres are: UKMay, 2025 SpainMay, 2025 BulgariaMarch, 2025 CopenhagenAugust, 2024 Blog I have a blog. I have not been very good at updating it lately, but here are my most recent posts: 2024-02-21: Security analysis of Apple's iMessage PQ3 protocol 2024-02-06: Launch of the Linux Foundation's Post-Quantum Cryptography Alliance 2023-10-22: New York Times article on post-quantum cryptography 2020-04-20: Joint Statement on Contact Tracing 2019-01-30: NIST Post-Quantum Crypto Standardization project round 2 Contact information Â»",
