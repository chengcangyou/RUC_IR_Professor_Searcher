During the Ph.D. he investigated new techniques for recovering sensitive information from hidden servers in anonymity networks. From 2018 to 2020, he has been a postdoctoral researcher at the University College London and the Technische UniversitÃ¤t Berlin, studying Internet privacy and abuses in the IoT ecosystem. In 2021, he spent six months as a postdoctoral researcher at the IMDEA Networks before joining the IMDEA Software Institute. Research Interests Srdjan’s research interests are in the fields of security and measurement, with a special focus on privacy. He uses data-driven research to design and implement scalable techniques that expose the internals of modern applications, collect information on how different components interact and gather evidence on how applications and devices handle sensitive data. His work combines active measurements and information from third-party services to study the impact of data leakage in highly secured environments. Srdjanâs research had an impact on the software used by tens of thousands of users, leading to changes in the framework the Tor Project uses to provide statistics about the usage of the anonymity network.
