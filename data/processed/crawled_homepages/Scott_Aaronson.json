My research interests center around the capabilities and limits of quantum computers, and computational complexity theory more generally. For the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 academic years, I was on leave to work at OpenAI on the theoretical foundations of AI safety. Information for Prospective PhD Students: At UT Austin, admissions are strictly through the yearly application process, not through emailing individual faculty members like me. I'm always on the lookout for great students. If you apply for a PhD in CS and specify that you want to work with me, I'll be sure to see your application. (I can also supervise or co-supervise physics students, but in that case I play no role in admissions.) Admissions are extremely competitive, so I urge you to apply broadly to maximize your chances.
