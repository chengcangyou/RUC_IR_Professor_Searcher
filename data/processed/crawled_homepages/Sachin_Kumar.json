In particular, I am interested in building language technologies that work for all people---language models that can uniformly support diverse languages, domains, populations, and individuals. Some research directions I am currently excited about are: Multilingual models that can equitably support written and spoken languages. Continual adaptation of NLP models to support new languages, varieties, domains, and capabilities. Personalization of language technologies to diverse user preferences.Evaluation of language models for scenarios that real users care about (especially interested in uses for experts like scientists and clinicians) These directions touch various parts of a typical machine learning pipeline, including building new datasets, modeling paradigms and architectures, training and inference algorithms, and evaluation methodologies. I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Allen Institute for AI (AI2) and obtained my Ph.D. at the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in 2023, with the final two years of my PhD spent visiting the University of Washington in Seattle. News:[November 2025] New preprint on AI assistance in scientific writing.[November 2025] New preprint out on reasoning for instruction hierarchy resolution: VerIH.[November 2025] Recognized as an outstanding Senior Area Chair at EMNLP 2025. [October 2025] New preprint out on evaluating research ideas: ScholarEval.[September 2025] New preprint out on continually adding new languages to multilingual LMs.[August 2025] I will be at COLM to co-organize MELT workshop.[August 2025] Steering Off Course wins SAC Highlights award at ACL 2025! 🎉[July 2025] Co-organizing Tokenization Workshop at ICML 2025!
