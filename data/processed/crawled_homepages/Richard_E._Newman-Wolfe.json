Newman-Wolfe): Home Page Richard Newman, PhD Security Activity Other Research Teaching Publications Other Info UF 2014-2015 Calendar Home Page I am a faculty member with the University of Florida's Computer and Information Science and Engineering Department. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of Rochester Computer Science Department in Rochester, NY in 1986. I earned my BA in Mathematics from New College in Sarasota, FL, and attended Eckerd College in St. Petersberg, FL. Office hours (fall 2018) MWF 2-3pm CSE-E340 Currently, I am working with Raytheon Corporation on a security-related IPPD project. I am working with a graduate student on cloud security using blockchain/smart contracts to implement customer-oriented policies. I am also studying some innovations in stream cryptography that I believe will improve security. I am an independent research consultant and expert witness. Until recently I was working with Qualcomm on powerline communications, and contributed to the HomePlug Powerline Alliance standards for in-home, access, and more recently, greenPHY powerline communications. These efforts have also resulted in standards by the IEEE (P1901) and SAE. I am currently working on a patent litigation case, and have previously given testimony in cases involving distributed systems and network security. Areas of expertise include: Computer and Network Security Cryptography and Cryptographic Protocols Distributed Systems Network Protocols, Topologies, and Architecture Powerline Communications I have worked with Drs. Ira Moskowitz and Paul Syverson of the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), at the Center for High Assurance Computing and Systems on information hiding, covert channels, steganography, and an information theoretic basis for traffic analysis, including analysis of Mix Networks. Twenty years ago I introduced the graduate course on Computer and Network Security to UF, and since then have taught it many times, as well as special topics courses in Cryptography, Cryptographic Protocols, Anonymity, Theory of Security, and Cybersecurity. Currently I am working with Profs. Wilson, Traynor, Butler, Chen, and Oliviera (ECE) to revamp the security curriculum at UF, and to introduce certificate programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels in cybersecurity. With students and colleagues, I have published dozens of academic papers on security models, access control, steganography, covert channels, traffic analysis, and cryptographic protocols, and have supervised numerous students now working in the security field. For more information, view my Security Activity page. I am on the editorial board of the International Journal of Network Management (IJNM). I was co-chair of the 2006 IEEE ISPLC symposium , which was held at Disney's Coronado Springs Resort in Orlando, 26-29 March 2006, and I am publications chair of 2015 IEEE Smart Grid Communications Conference to be held in Miami, FL November 2-5, 2015. For more information, you may check my curriculum vita. If you prefer resume style descriptions of projects, etc., then you may want to check the long rtf resume or the pdf version of same. A two-page rtf resume and its pdf version are also available. You can find more details on my research interests, people with whom I work, and other miscellaneous information by using the links in the left navigation panel.
