I also had courtesy appointments in Chemistry and Quantitative Biomedical Sciences for some of that time. I was fortunate to be able to work with an amazing group of students, postdocs, and colleagues, pursuing a broad range of research at the intersection of computation and the life sciences. One line of research led to my starting a company with my colleague and collaborator Karl Griswold from the Dartmouth Thayer School of Engineering. Due to the success of our company in using computational methods to drive the development of next-generation biotherapeutics, I decided to take the leap and devote myself to seeing our work fully developed and applied to treating disease. I'd like to thank the department and university for supporting me throughout my time here, including my long juggling act between being a professor and doing the start-up thing. Thanks also to the students in my courses over the years, for always being engaging and keeping me on my toes, rising to the challenges I gave, and looking to get the most out of every topic. And of course huge thanks, from the bottom of my heart, to my wonderful lab members and collaborators over the years for such inspiring and memorable times working (and having fun) together. If you're interested in our research, probably the best thing to do is browse pubmed; my name is sufficiently unique :).
