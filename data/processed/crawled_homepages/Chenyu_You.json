He is also affiliated with the CVLab, AI institute, and Institute for Advanced Computational Science. Previously, he received his Ph.D. in 2024 from Yale University under the advisement of James S. Duncan, his M.S. in 2019 from Stanford University under the advisement of Daniel Rubin, and his B.S. in 2017 from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute under the advisement of Ge Wang, all in electrical engineering. He has also spent wonderful time at Facebook AI Research (FAIR), as well as Google Research. Research My group studies AI for health -- building machines that learn from biomedical data, reason about, interact with the clinical world, and drive meaningful impact on healthcare. Besides learning algorithms, we ask: how AI should represent knowledge across imaging, text, and multi-omics data; what principles ensure robustness, trustworthy, and clinical reliability; and how algorithmic advances can translate into real-world healthcare domains. Our research aims to answer these questions by advancing machine learning methods in close collaboration with biomedical and clinical science. Foundation: How do we build world foundation models that generalize across diverse clinical tasks? Representative projects : MedSAM / MONA / ARCO / KGAE / UniHGKR Reliability: How can we build complex AI systems that clinicians can trust and rely on? Representative projects : SpuriousMemorization / CFR / CASTformer Access: How can we turn advances in AI into efficient, deployable tools that improve healthcare and advance scientific discovery? Representative projects : CSR / OTSurv / MORSE Here is some information for prospective students and visitors. News [2025.11] Thrilled to serve as Associate Editor for Medical Image Analysis!
