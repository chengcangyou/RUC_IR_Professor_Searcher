I got into engineering because I realised the best way for me to understand complex and interesting systems is to attempt to design and implement them What are your research goals? My research goals are to design and implement computational systems that can learn from experience what they need to know and what they need to do to achieve their design goals What do people not understand about what you do? People often don’t understand how difficult it can be to make computers able to do the kind of things they can already \"do\" in movies and on TV Advice for prospective [insert school] engineers Engineering can a long and twisty route with lots of intellectual foothills to climb but the sense of achievement from every summit you reach is unbeatable Lectures/Courses taught COMP9417 Machine Learning and Data Mining; BINF2010 Bioinformatics 1; BINF3010 Bioinformatics Methods and Applications; BINF3020 Computational Bioinformatics Students (delete section if not applicable) Number currently in lab: 8 Number graduated: 30+ Student Projects: Projects are in a wide range of machine learning problems and applications in science and engineering.
