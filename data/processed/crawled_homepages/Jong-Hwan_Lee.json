We believe our findings will be gainfully applied to develop essential applications in various domains.Now, the Question isHow can we build such AI-enabled models for brain signals and apply the models in real-world scenarios?What would be the most feasible applications for us to focus on?If you want to join BSPL, please send your bio/personal statement and/or CV to PI.BSPL 연구실에서는 이러한 연구들에 관심있는 석사, 석-박통합, 박사과정 학생 및 연구원을 모집하고 있습니다. 관심있는 분은 간단한 자기소개와 CV 등을 이메일로 보내주시고, 추가적으로 궁금한 사항을 문의하기 위한 면담을 요청해 주시기 바랍니다.► Find out more details on our research aimsLab news► Find out more recent lab newsLab dinner and Farewell of Jundong and Soohyun (March 4, 2024)Assistant Professor Appointment for our alumnus, Hojin Jang (March 1, 2024)BESK 2024 Brain and AI Symposium: Awards and having some fun!
