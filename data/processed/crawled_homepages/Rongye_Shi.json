I'm an associate professor (tenure-track) with the School of  Artificial Intelligence at Beihang University, Beijing, China. Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Professors Manuela M. Veloso (member of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering and IEEE/ACM/AAAI/AAAS Fellow) and Peter Steenkiste (IEEE Fellow). From 2019-2020, I was a postdoctoral research scientist with the School of Engineering and Applied Science at Columbia University, advised by Professors Sharon Di and Qiang Du. From 2020-2023, I joined Huawei as a principal engineer. My research focuses on machine learning, reinforcement learning, multiagent systems, and their applications on smart cities.
