In particular, I like to work on problems in online learning/sequential prediction (prediction with expert advice, multi-armed bandits, and reinforcement learning theory), statistical learning theory (empirical process theory, PAC-Bayesian methods), and transfer learning (especially lifelong learning and principled methods of transferring representations). Most recently, I'm interested in problems of learning in the presence of self-interested agents. Now somewhat ancient history but still fun stuff: Prior to coming to Victoria, I was a postdoc at CWI in Amsterdam (with Peter Grünwald) and at the Australian National University in Canberra (with Bob Williamson). I did my PhD in the College of Computing at Georgia Tech, where I was advised by Alex Gray.
