Also check out the nice highlight by EigenPhi.03/25🎉 “Decentralization of Ethereum’s Builder Market” is accepted to IEEE S&P 2025. Congrats, Sen!02/25📣 “AUCIL: An Inclusion List Design for Rational Parties” is online.01/25🎉 Qelect is accepted to USENIX Security 2025.01/25🎉 Prooφ is accepted to FC 2025.Research: Secure Decentralized SystemsMy research spans computer security and applied cryptography, with a focus on security, privacy, and incentive-compatibility problems in systems with decentralized trust and governance. Some recent projects are:Oracle protocols and applications: DECO and Town Crier are now realized by Chainlink in Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE), announced at SmartCon'25. In addition, at least ten startup companies are building variants of these works, collectively known as “zkTLS”.Applications in Decentralized Identity (CanDID), Machine Learning and AI (e.g., Juels and Koushanfar)Privacy-preserving protocols for decentralized systems:Anonymous broadcast: Zipnet, which is being implemented by Flashbots.Secret Leader election: QelectAnonymous identity: ASC, MISO, CanDIDDistributed ZKPs: zkBridge, Cirrus.zkBridge is implemented by Polyhedra Network.Incentives/Mechanisms:Understanding and mitigating MEV: PBS Centralization, AnimaguSwap, BFT Order Fairness, Insecurity Through ObscurityBribery-resistant mechanisms: censorship-resistance gadget, cross-chain swapsBug bounty for TEE side channelsFor a systematic overview of my research, please check out the research page, or my publications.Interested in working with me?I’m looking for one PhD student to start in 2026 Fall. Please read here for more information.For Yale undergrads: we enjoy having undergrad researchers in our lab to help them gain research experience. Feel free to get in touch.We have openings for Postdocs, visiting scholars, and summer interns for strong candidates.ContactEmail: f.zhang at yale.eduOffice: 51 Prospect St, New Haven, CTBook a Meeting with meGoogle ScholarTwitterGitHub",
