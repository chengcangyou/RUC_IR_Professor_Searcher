China Email: xiaoy367 at mail.sysu.edu.cn [Google Scholar] [Github] [DBLP] About me My current research focus is evaluating the trustworthiness of deep learning systems including trustworthiness evaluation for autonomous driving, deep neural network repair for improving the accuracy of models, input discrimination for deep learning systems. My research is within the domain of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence in application domains related to software bug localization, software code readability, software integration test, data mining, and big data analysis. My researches are undertaken in a broad spectrum of application domains, such as self-driving cars, deep neural network analysis, and hydrological data analysis. I held a Research Fellow in SoC, National University of Singapore in the group of Prof. Jin Song Dong and Prof. David S. Rosenblum and under the supervision of Prof. Ivan Beschastnikh. I received my Ph.D degree in Computer Science from City University of Hong Kong under the supervision of Prof. Jacky Keung. Thanks to the supervision of Prof. Hong Xu and Dr. George Trimponias, I started my research career at Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab.
