We develop tools for analysis of immunogenomics sequencing data to reveal patterns of susceptibility to diseases within and across populations and study the evolution of adaptive immunity.We are hiring PhD students and postdocs Come work with us in the exciting field of immunogenomics!Where to find us:W204 Westgate Building, Pennsylvania State University,University Park, State College, PA 16802, USAGoogle SitesReport abuseGoogle SitesReport abuse",
