However, they do not work equally well across users from diverse demographics, particularly in India where users span a wide variety of speech accents, dialects and languages. My work focuses on building speech and language technologies for such low-resource settings. A current key challenge of interest is how to enable effective transfer of knowledge from a pretrained model to new domains, and how to train large language models in parameter-efficient and cost-effective ways. About me: I joined IITB in September 2016. Prior to that, I was a Beckman Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I obtained my Ph.D. from the CSE Department at The Ohio State University in 2013. My research interests are broadly in machine learning as applied to speech and language. Note: I am currently on a year-long leave in the US (as a Visiting Scholar at Stanford University until August 2025, with a subsequent appointment as a Visiting Researcher at Google DeepMind) from 2025 to 2026. During this time, I will generally be less available to participate in most academic or research commitments (other than with existing students/collaborators). Apologies in advance.
