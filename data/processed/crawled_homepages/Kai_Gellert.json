Kai Gellert Akademischer Oberrat (tenured position) Privatdozent für Informatik mit Schwerpunkt IT-Sicherheit und Kryptographie (comparable to an associate professorship) gellert[at]uni-wuppertal.de Campus Freudenberg Building FME, Room 2.12 Google Scholar Short Vita 2025: Appointed Akademischer Oberrat auf Lebenszeit \t2024: Appointed Privatdozent (comparable to an associate professorship) in Computer Science, specializing in IT Security and Cryptography 2024: Completed my habilitation and achieved the Lehrbefähigung (i.e., qualification to teach) in Computer Science, specializing in IT Security and Cryptography 2023: Appointed Akademischer Rat auf Lebenszeit (i.e., achieved tenure) 2021: Appointed Akademischer Rat auf Probe (probation period) 2020: Completed my PhD with distinction under supervision of Tibor Jager and with Colin Boyd as second examiner 2019-2021: Research assistant at University of Wuppertal, Germany 2017-2019: Reseach assistant at Paderborn University, Germany 2015-2017: Completed my master's degree in IT Security and Information Engineering at Ruhr University Bochum 2012-2015: Completed my bachelor's degree in IT Security and Information Engineering at Ruhr University Bochum My research interests lie at the intersection of theoretical and real-world cryptography, where I enjoy analyzing and improving the security of real-world communication protocols. This includes, e.g., the analysis of complex protocols such as the WhatsApp end-to-end encrypted backup protocol, developing efficient protocols with tailored security properties, or investigating if certain security properties are even possible to achieve in practice (and how to potentially evade such impossibility results). Research Projects 2025-2028: Theoretical Foundations of Real-World Password Authenticated Key Exchange, DFG Research Grant Honors and Awards 2025: One of my students won a Barmenia-Förderpreis for outstanding bachelor theses on a topic with a strong mathematical focus 2024: Two of my students won a Barmenia-Förderpreis for outstanding bachelor theses on a topic with a strong mathematical focus GDD-Wissenschaftspreis 2020 for an outstanding PhD thesis in the areas of data protection and data security Deutschlandstipendium 2016, awarded to students with outstanding achievements and social commitment Deutschlandstipendium 2015, awarded to students with outstanding achievements and social commitment Media Coverage Wissenschaftliche Codeknacker; University of Wuppertal, 2022 GDD-Wissenschaftspreis für Wuppertaler Kryptographie-Forscher; University of Wuppertal, November 2020 It's time you were T0RTT a lesson: Here's how you could build a better Tor, say boffins; The Register, December 2019 Effizientere Sicherheit gegen Datenkraken und Massenüberwachung; University of Wuppertal, December 2019 Independent Teaching Experience During my time at the University of Wuppertal, I have independently taught the following courses: Grundlagen der IT-Sicherheit (WiSe 2022/23, WiSe 2023/24, WiSe 2024/25, WiSe 2025/26) Moderne Kryptographie (SoSe 2022, SoSe 2023, SoSe 2024, SoSe 2025) Effiziente Implementierung kryptographischer Verfahren (WiSe 2020/21, WiSe 2021/22, WiSe 2022/23, WiSe 2024/25) Communication Security for Modern Applications (SoSe 2021) In addition, I have independently supervised and examined > 15 bachelor's and master's theses.
