I received my PhD degree in Computer Science and Software Engineering from the University of Melbourne, Australia, and worked as a research fellow in the University of Melbourne, RMIT University and Monash University, Australia. My research interest falls in the intersection of databases, artificial intelligence and ubiquitous computing. My research focuses on complex spatial data management, analytics and learning, particularly in the context of urban and sustainable development, with an emphasis on privacy considerations. I have published my works on premium venues like Ubicomp, ICDE, CIKM, EDBT, Pervasive and Mobile Computing, TKDE, T-ITS, WWW Journal and Information Systems. In 2017, I received the prestigious OWSD-Elsevier Foundation Award for Early-Career Women Scientists in the Developing World in Engineering Sciences and in 2018 I was recognized as one of the top 100 scientists in Asia by Asian Scientist Magazine.  Google SitesReport abuseGoogle SitesReport abuse",
