This means that any speculative emails asking about interships are likely to go unanswered.  Sorry. Similarly I do not currently have any funded doctoral places in my research areas.  You are still welcome apply through the regular process, mention Computational Biology and ask to be considered for a range of potential studentships.BiographyI am a mathematician (with an extremely strong interest in computer science!). I studied mathematics at Queen Mary and Westfield College from 1987, and then came to the Mathematical Institute in Oxford to study for a DPhil. in 1990. My project concerned viscous flow, in particular the motion of a solid ball in a rotating container of treacle. From 1994 to 1996 I was employed by the University of Bath to work on a large research project called Development of Modelling Tools for the Forging Industry. Since the beginning of 1997, I have been back in Oxford. I was initially employed as a research officer on the grant Manufacturing automation of large scale assemblies in the Computing Laboratory (now Department of Computer Science) and was then supervised by the late Stephen Cameron Selected PublicationsView AllManage publications A mathematical framework for the emergence of winners and losers in cell competition Thomas F Pak‚ Joe Pitt−Francis and Ruth E Baker In Journal of Theoretical Biology.
