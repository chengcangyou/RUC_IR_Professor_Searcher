I’m currently Associate Professor (as of June 2017!) at the Department of Computer Science, School of Engineering, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. I’m also (as of June 2024) the head of the Department. My research is in human-centered computing, especially with applications for healthcare and education. I am also working in human-centered artificial intelligence topics (HCAI). My research group is called HumaLab UC, and we are part of HAPLAB (Human & Process Data Science Research Lab). We are always searching for new Ph.D and Master’s students with a passion for understanding users & developing novel technologies! I’m also involved in initiatives for women in computing: I co-founded and help organize Chilewic, and I am a member of Latinas In Computing. I have two kids so I enjoy spending time with them, baking, traveling and (occasionally) taking pictures. If you need to contact me, please send me an e-mail.
