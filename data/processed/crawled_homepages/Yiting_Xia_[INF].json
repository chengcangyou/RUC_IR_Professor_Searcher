My work involves network architecture design, novel transmission means for cloud applications, network programmability, switch fabric design, network measurements, and network management.Before joining MPI, I was a research scientist at Facebook, where I designed and implemented the Facebook network infrastructure, including the edge, data center, and backbone networks. I received my PhD degree in Computer Science from Rice University in 2018. My thesis research was on novel networked systems for faster transmission, better fault tolerance, and easier management of cloud data centers. I got my Bachelor’s Degree in Telecommunications Engineering with First Class Honors from a joint program between Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) and Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) in 2011.I am hiring! I am looking for strong and motivated PhD and MS students, postdoctoral researchers, research interns, and visiting scholars. If you are interested, please read my ongoing research topics for more details and email me your CV and a brief summary of your research interests. Google SitesReport abusePage detailsPage updated Google SitesReport abuse",
