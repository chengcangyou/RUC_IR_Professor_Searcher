  "content": "Jérôme Waldispühl About I conduct research in computational biology, human-computer interaction, and citizen science. My research research activities splits into two areas. First, I develop algorithms and machine learning framework for predicting RNA structures and small-molecule interactions. Next, I explore the potential of video games to accelerate scientific discovery, with a particular focus on metagenomics applications. I received a PhD in Computer Science from École Polytechnnique (France) in 2004 under the mentorship of Jean-Marc Steyaert. From 2005 to 2006, I was a post-doctoral researcher in the group of Peter Clote at Boston College, and in 2006 I moved to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where I was an instructor in applied mathematics under the mentorship of Bonnie Berger. In 2009, I joined the School of Computer Science at McGill University as a faculty member.
