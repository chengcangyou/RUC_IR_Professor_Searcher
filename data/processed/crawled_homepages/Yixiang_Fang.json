He received the Bachelor Degree from Harbin Engineering University in 2010, Master Degree from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2013, and Ph.D. Degree from the University of Hong Kong in 2017, advised by Prof. Reynold Cheng. After receiving the Ph.D. Degree, he worked as a Research Associate in the University of New South Wales during 2018-2020, working with Prof. Xuemin Lin. He once was a visiting scholar at Nanyang Technological University in 2016, working with Prof. Gao Cong.Dr. Fangâs general research interests mainly focus on data management, data mining, and artificial intelligence over big data, particularly the topics of graph data management, graph data mining, LLM+Graph, graph neural network, representation learning. He has published extensively in the areas of database, data mining, and artificial intelligence, and most of them were published in top-tier conferences (e.g., VLDB, SIGMOD, ICDE, NeurIPS, WWW, AAAI, and IJCAI) and journals (e.g., TODS, VLDBJ and TKDE). Particularly, one of his representative papers was selected as One of the four Best Papers in SIGMOD'2020 (~4/458) and awarded the 2021 ACM SIGMOD Research Highlight Award. He obtained the 2025 CUHK-Shenzhen Teaching Achievement Award (Excellent Prize). He is an Editorial Board Member of the journal Information Processing & Management (IPM). He has also served as program committee members for several top conferences (e.g., VLDB, ICDE, KDD, WWW, AAAI, and IJCAI), invited reviewers for top journals (e.g., TKDE and VLDBJ) in the areas of database and data mining. He is a member of ACM, IEEE, and CCF, and an executive member of CCF Database Technical Committee. Academic Publications [1] Yuyang Xia, Yixiang Fang*, Wensheng Luo.
