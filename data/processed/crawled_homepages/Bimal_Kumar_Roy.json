Taught at Indian Statistical Institute for over 30 years, since 1984. Taught at almost all degree courses offered at the Institute â B.Stat., M.Stat., M.Math., M.Tech.(CS), M.Tech.(QR&OR) and M.S.(QE) â at almost every possible level. Taught more than 60 courses, including almost all courses related to Statistics and Computer Science offered at all undergraduate and postgraduate levels of the Institute. Pioneered Cryptology education in India. Taught the subject through numerous courses, lectures, popular talks, seminars and workshops, and promoted this niche subject area. Supervised over fifty (50) Masters dissertations in four different technical areas -- Master of Statistics, Master of Mathematics, Master of Technology in Computer Science, and Master of Technology in Quality, Reliability and Operations Research.
