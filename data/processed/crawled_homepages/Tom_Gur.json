I am also affiliated with the Centre for Quantum Information and Foundations in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics. My research is in theoretical computer science, focusing on the interplay between computation, randomness, and quantum mechanics. I am particularly interested in classical and quantum complexity theory, sublinear algorithms, and their connections to harmonic analysis and additive combinatorics. My work is supported by an ERC Starting Grant, a UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship, and grants from the EPSRC. News: We are hiring Assistant/Associate Professors in Theoretical Computer Science; apply here. Postdoc and PhD student positions are also available. Research Interests My current interests include classical and quantum aspects of: Complexity theory Sublinear algorithms and property testing Cryptography, zero-knowledge proofs, and probabilistically checkable proofs Locally testable and locally decodable codes Learning theory Structure-versus-randomness and local-to-global phenomena Harmonic analysis and additive combinatorics in theoretical computer science My Research Group I am fortunate to supervise the following students and postdocs. Current Hugo Aaronson (PhD student) Yiyi Cai (Master's student; Gates scholar) Davi Castro-Silva (Postdoc; co-supervising with Anuj Dawar and Sergii Strelchuk) Guy Goldberg (PhD student; co-supervising with Irit Dinur) Jérôme Guyot (Researcher) Isaac Holt (PhD student) Deepanshu Kush (Postdoc) Longcheng",
