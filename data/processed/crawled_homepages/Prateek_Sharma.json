At UMass, I was advised by Prashant Shenoy. My thesis looks at running applications with high performance and availability at extremely low cost in cloud environments. I am broadly interested in Operating Systems, Cloud Computing, and Virtualization. My current research focuses on transiency in public clouds. Some of my recent work is centered around using Amazon EC2 Spot instances effectively to run different types of applications. I graduated from BITS-Pilani in 2009 and completed my masters degree in Computer Science from IIT-Bombay in 2012, where I was advised by Purushottam Kulkarni and worked on issues related to memory deduplication and page cache partitioning for virtual machines (Thesis). Students I am looking for motivated students interested in research in large-scale distributed systems, cloud computing, and distributed machine learning. Please email me or drop-by my office! Current PhD Students Abdul Rehman Siddharth Anil Graduated PhD Students Alex Fuerst [3 letter agency] Previously Advised Sahil Tyagi News [March 2024] NSF CAREER awarded for Green Functions as a Service Research Interests I like exploring the behavior of complex computing systems software. In particular: operating systems, virtualization, cloud platforms, large distributed systems for data processing and machine learning, networks, and anything else that catches my fancy.
