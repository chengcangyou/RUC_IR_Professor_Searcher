I focus on practical applications involving web-scale graphs and social networks, combining theoretical foundations with real-world impact.I have studied and worked at well-known research institutions in Germany and Canada, including the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI), the Institute for Web Science and Technologies, the German Institute for Applied Research in Visual Computing (Fraunhofer IGD), and the Big Data Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University. These experiences have shaped my approach to tackling complex challenges in graph-based AI systems.After moving from academia to industry, I worked in the maritime sector as a AI Scientist and Director of Data Science. In these roles, I secured funding for research and development projects and created patented technologies that advanced AI applications in maritime operations.My research contributions include several peer-reviewed publications on representing and using data provenance to improve the reliability and transparency of AI systems (please check publications for more details).Google SitesReport abusePage detailsPage updated Google SitesReport abuse",
