Using mixed methods, I study human behaviour when interacting with these systems, leveraging human-centred methodologies, tools, and pipelines to isolate behavioural patterns. These patterns inform computational user models of usability, engagement, and knowledge acquisition, which in turn support AI-driven interventions for decision-making.My current research focuses on two areas. First, in healthcare, I investigate the implementation of eXplainable AI (XAI) to support critical decision-making in environments such as the ICU, clinical dashboards, and health tracking applications. Second, I explore how AI can enhance workforce learning opportunities, well-being, and performance in the workplace.
