I obtained my doctoral degree from the Human-Computer Interaction Initiative, Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), where I was under the supervision of Prof. Xiaojuan Ma. My primary research interest revolves around the field of Human-Engaged Computing, with a particular emphasis on: Leveraging foundation models and conceptual metaphors to stimulate creative ideation and inspiration. Enhancing exploratory and explanatory data analysis through novel visualization and narrative techniques. Fostering user engagement and well-being in digital environments by incorporating positive computing principles. Our research center welcomes graduate students and visiting interns/scholars who share a strong interest in these areas. Please get in touch with your resume/CV to learn more about potential opportunities.
