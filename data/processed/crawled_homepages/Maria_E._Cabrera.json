I'm Maru Cabrera I am currently a an Assistant Professor at the University of Massachusetts Lowell (UML). My research interests focus on aspects of Human-Robot Interaction intersecting with accessibility; working on service robots that can help people with mobility limitations or target populations like older adults by collaborating to complete tasks at home. ​ I obtained my PhD from Purdue University in 2018, working in the Intelligent Systems and Assistive Technologies (ISAT) Lab in the School of Industrial Engineering, under the supervision of Dr. Juan P. Wachs. My dissertation topic was about One-Shot Gesture Recognition. After that I did a postdoc working with Dr. Maya Cakmak in the Human Centered Robotics Lab (HCR). ​EDUCATIONEDUCATIONPhD in Industrial Engineering at Purdue University. West Lafayette, IN.

The course was framed around the RoboCup@Home competition.2014-2018 Graduate Teaching and Research Assistant (TA/RA) School of Industrial Engineering at Purdue University. West Lafayette, IN. USA I was a TA for undergraduate and graduate courses (IE-343 Engineering Economics and IE-574 Robotics and Flexible Assembly respectively). As part of my RA work, I was a member of a multidisciplinary team working on Surgical Telementoring with Augmented Reality.2012-2013 Instructor Level Professor Electronics and Circuits Department at Simon Bolivar University. Caracas, Venezuela I was in charge of core courses like Electrical Circuit Analysis and Laboratory of Electrical Measurements. Among the responsibilities were preparing the lectures, assignments and exams, as well as coordinating with other professors teaching other sections to keep a consistent syllabus.2008-2011 Graduate Teaching Assistant (TA) Electronics and Circuits Department at Simon Bolivar University. Caracas, Venezuela As TA, my responsibilities included providing assistance during lab hours, grading and teaching review lessons before exams.EXPERIENCEAWARDSAWARDS2019 RoboCup Visiting Fellow Received it on July 2019.
