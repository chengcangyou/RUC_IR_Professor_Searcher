Before this, I had the pleasure of serving as a faculty member in the Computer Science and Engineering department at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, India from August 2010 to August 2021. In addition, I had a brief but fulfilling postdoctoral stint at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research from August 2009 to July 2010. I completed my Ph.D. at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, India in 2009, where I was advised by Meena Mahajan. News Manon Blanc has joined as a post-doc from July 2025. My inaugural lecture is now available online! On the PC of STOC 2025, FOCS 2025, and MFCS 2025. Research I am interested in several topics in theoretical computer science. My research mainly focuses on Complexity Theory. In the recent years, I have been spending most of my time thinking about problems in algebraic complexity theory. Publications Here is a link to a list of my publications. Awards and honours Keynote speaker at the Computational Complexity Conference 2024. Received ACM India Outstanding Contributions in Computing by a Woman Award 2023. Featured in Vigyan Vidushi, a Resource Book on Profiles of Indian Women Scientists, put together by Department of Science and Technology, Government of India.
