Some of my research goals include improving the safety and usability of AR, promoting cross-functional and interdisciplinary research efforts, better understanding the human brain and its relationship with machines, and improving the development of AI. I was funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) fellowship for research on intelligent AR from 2015 - 2017,  by the U.S. Office of Naval Research Global (ONRG) for my work on Vision Enhancement From 2017 - 2021, and again by JSPS for my work on Cognitive Symbiosis for 2021 - 2025.LinkedIn   |   Google Scholar   |   Curriculum Vitae   |   Publicity   |   YouTube   |   GitHub Useful Research:An Open Source Eye Tracker for Python  |  GitHub  |  Video Fast Selection with Eye Tracking for AR/VR/MR  |  Paper |  GitHub  |  Video 3D Gaze Tracker  |  Paper |  GitHub  |  Video Fast Gaze-based Window Switching  |  GitHub  |  Video Eye-tracked Simulation of Visual Deficits in VR  |  Paper  |  Video An Interface to Simulate and Assist with Macular Degeneration  |  Paper  |  Video Gaze-based Rotation Control |  Paper  |  Video Vertigo Simulation (BPPV) |   Video TopicsEye Tracking and PrototypingHead mounted display prototypes for augmented and mixed realityAugmented RealityInteraction, content management, and XR interfacesArtificial Intelligence and VisualizationIntegration of artificial intelligence with XR and visualizationIntelligent AgentsAgents that resonate with the user's cognitive stateGoogle SitesReport abusePage detailsPage updated Google SitesReport abuse",
