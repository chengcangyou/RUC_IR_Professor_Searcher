A second area of interest is Computer Science education and, more broadly, STEM education including at the high-school level. Recently, I have become interested in the potential of video games to dramatically improve the quality of STEM education. I am also interested in approaches to assessment and program improvement of Computer Science programs. Over the last several years, I have served as a program evaluator (PEV) as well as a Team Chair (TC) for the ABET/CAC evaluation of a number of Computer Science programs. As the past chair of the CSE Department's Undergraduate Studies Committee, I was primarily responsible for overseeing the successful accreditation evaluation of the BS-CSE program over several cycles.
