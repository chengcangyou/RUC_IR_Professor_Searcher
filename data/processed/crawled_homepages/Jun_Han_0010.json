Prior that, I spent two years at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, as an assistant professor. I recevied my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering at University of Notre Dame under the supervison of Prof. Chaoli Wang. I received my master’s degree in Computer Software and Theory and my bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering. Both are from Xidian University.ResearchMy research lies at the intersection of scientific visualization, human-computer interaction, and machine learning. Scientific simulations generate vast amounts of volumetric data essential for understanding various natural phenomena. My works seek to address the following key challenges: How can we develop learning-driven algorithms to efficiently and effectively manage large-scale simulation data for the prupose of data reduction and visualization? Representative papers include KD-INR and CoordNet. How can we design generative models to rapidly produce scientific data? Representative papers include V2V and STNet. How can we build intelligent and interactive systems that empower domain scientists to explore and visualize volumetric data for better decision-making and deeper insights? Representative papers include FlowNet and DTBIA.The goal of my research is to answer these questions.To Prospective StudentsThe Ph.D. quota for 2026 Fall has been fully filled. [Ph.D. Applicant] I plan to recuit students in 2026 Fall. If you are interested in working with me, please send an email to hanjun@ust.hk and fill out this form. [Research Assistant and Visiting Student] I have several openings for research assistant and visiting positions focused on developing machine learning-driven solutions for ocean visualization. Interested students are encouraged to reach out via email for further discussion.
