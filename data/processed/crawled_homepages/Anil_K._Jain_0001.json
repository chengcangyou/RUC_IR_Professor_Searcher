For his many advances in pattern recognition and biometrics, Jain was inducted into the United States National Academy of Engineering (2016), Indian National Academy of Engineering (2016), The World Academy of Sciences (2019), Chinese Academy of Sciences (2019) and the National Academy of Inventors (2015). Jain served as the Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (1991-1994) and was awarded the Guggenheim, Humboldt and Fulbright fellowships along with the IAPR King-Sun Fu Prize. He was appointed to the Defense Science Board, Forensic Science Standards Board, and the AAAS study team on Latent Fingerprint Recognition. He has authored foundational books in both biometrics and pattern recognition including Introduction to Biometrics (Springer, 2011 and 2024), Handbook of Face Recognition (Springer, 2005, 2011, 2024), Handbook of Fingerprint Recognition (Springer, 2005, 2009, 2022), Handbook of Multibiometrics (Springer, 2006) and Algorithms for Clustering Data (Prentice-Hall, 1988). For his plethora of discoveries and applications in biometrics, his service to the research community, and his extensive mentorship, Jain was awarded Doctor Honoris Causa by Universidad AutÃ³noma de Madrid (2017), Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (2020) and Hong Kong Baptist University (2021). The BBVA Foundation granted him its Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Information and Communication Technologies (2025). His list of publications is available at Google Scholar. Vita   Lab  Email",
