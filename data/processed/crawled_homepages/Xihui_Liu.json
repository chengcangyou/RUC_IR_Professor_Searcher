Before joining HKU, I was a postdoc Scholar at EECS Department and BAIR at UC Berkeley, advised by Prof. Trevor Darrell. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Multimedia Lab (MMLab), Chinese University of Hong Kong, supervised by Prof. Xiaogang Wang and Prof. Hongsheng Li. I received bachelor's degree in Electronic Engineering in Tsinghua University. My research interests cover computer vision, deep learning, and artificial intelligence, with special emphasis on generative AI, multimodal AI, and embodied AI. I was awarded Stanford World's Top 2% Scientists 2025, WAIC Rising Stars Award 2022, Rising Stars in EECS 2021, and Adobe Research Fellowship 2020. I serve as Area Chairs for CVPR, ICLR, NeurIPS, AAAI, and ACM MultiMedia. I am actively looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students, postdoctoral scholars, research assistants, and visiting students to join my group. Please drop me an email if you are interested. Eligible students can apply for Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS) and HKU Presidential PhD Scholar Programme (HKU-PS). Postgraduate scholarships (PGS) are granted to other students without HKPFS and HKU-PS. Due to the large number of emails I received, I cannot reply to all of them. But I do read all emails and reply to those that I am interested in. There's no need to send duplicate emails.
