  "content": "Dr Wenjia Bai I am a Reader (Associate Professor) in Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, jointly appointed at the Department of Computing and the Department of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London. I am one of the faculty members at the Biomedical Image Analysis (BioMedIA) Group and lead the Medical Vision group at the Data Science Institute. Previously, I completed my B.Eng and M.Eng in Automation at Tsinghua University, both with Distinction, and my D.Phil in Engineering Sciences at University of Oxford, under the supervision of Prof. Sir Michael Brady. I worked with Prof. Daniel Rueckert before starting the Lectureship position in 2018, and becoming Senior Lecturer in 2022 and Reader in 2025. I have published over 160 peer-reviewed journal and conference articles with over 16,000 citations and an H-index of 58. I publish on top computing conferences (MICCAI, ECCV, ICML, NeurIPS), major medical imaging journals (IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, Medical Image Analysis) and high-impact general journals (Nature, Nature Medicine, Nature Machine Intelligence, Nature Cardiovascular Research, Nature Communications). I am committed to open science and reproducible research. For example, a deep learning-based cardiac image analysis pipeline that I developed has been received over 150 stars on GitHub and has been deployed for analysing cardiac images of over 80,000 subjects from the UK Biobank, the worldâs largest ever imaging study. The derived imaging phenotypes that I shared with the UK Biobank community has contributed to a number of publications in Nature Research journals and for discovering novel genetic and phenotypical associations with disease outcomes. I serve on the Editorial Board of the scientific journal IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, as an Area Chair for MICCAI, and sits on the Grant Panels of Heart Research UK and Multiple Sclerosis Society. I received the Best Paper Award for Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance in 2018, the Imperial College Presidentâs Award for Outstanding Research Team in 2019, and the Dudley Pennell Prize in 2022. I have been involved in two EPSRC programme grants, as a research stream leader in the SmartHeart programme grant (2016-2021) and as co-investigator in the CVD-Net programme grant (2024-2029). I also lead an EPSRC project grant, a BHF New Horizon grant and an NIHR pilot grant as the principal investigator. news Sep 27, 2025 Congratulations to Qiang for receiving the MICCAI 2025 Young Scientist Award.
