My research interests include theoretical computer science, algorithms, graph theory, computational biology and bioinformatics, computational genomics, complex networks, and computational epidemiology. I completed a Ph.D. in computer science (1985) at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, an M.S. in mathematics (1976) at the University of Chicago, and a B.S. in mathematics (1975) at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Before joining the faculty at Virginia Tech in 1987, I was an instructor of applied mathematics and member of the Laboratory of Computer Science at MIT. I am a lifetime member of SIAM, a member of the ACM, and a senior member of the IEEE. I have retired from Virginia Tech as of the end of Summer, 2025! Consequently, I am not accepting new graduate students into my lab.",
