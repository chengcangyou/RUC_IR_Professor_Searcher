She specialises in Machine Listening. Her research is located on the intersection of robotics, machine learning, and acoustic signal processing. She is currently the Principal Investigator (PI) on the EPSRC-funded project \"Active AudiTiOn for Robots (ActivATOR)\", and a Co-Investigator (Co-I) on the EPSRC-funded project \"Challenges in Immersive Audio Technology (CIAT)\",  the UKRI Trustworthy Autonomous Systems Hub, and the UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Machine Intelligence for Nano- Electronic Devices and Systems (MINDS). Prior to joining the University of Southampton, she was the recipient of an EPSRC Fellowship to advance her work on \"Acoustic Signal Processing and Scene Analysis for Socially Assistive Robots\", hosted at Imperial College London. Her fellowship followed a position a research associate on the FP7 project \"Embodied Audition for Robots\" at Imperial College. She has previously worked in the industry as a senior systems engineer at Selex ES, Edinburgh (UK). She received her PhD in statistical signal processing from the University of Edinburgh, UK. She is a Senior Member of the IEEE, and served as a member of the IEEE SPS Challenges and Data Collections committee; as associate editor for IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech & Language Processing; and the EURASIP Journal on Audio, Speech, and Music Processing. She has served two terms as an elected member of the IEEE Signal Processing Society (SPS) Technical Committee on Audio and Acoustic Signal Processing, served on several conference organising committees, and is a regular reviewer for various journals and conferences across robotics, acoustics, and machine learning.
