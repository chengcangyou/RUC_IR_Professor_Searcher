My ultimate goal is to create a future where building software is more accessible, efficient, and enjoyable for everyone, while ensuring programmers still stay in control. To do so, I work at the intersection of software engineering, AI, and human-computer interaction. I received my PhD from Carnegie Mellon University in May 2024, where I was advised by Brad Myers, Bogdan Vasilescu, and Vincent Hellendoorn. I also received my MS from University of Southern California and BS from Yonsei University. Prior to starting at UC Irvine, I worked at Google as a Research Scientist analyzing and enhancing internal AI-powered developer tools, and previously as an intern at Google and Facebook. Details are in my CV. Assistant Professor University of California, Irvine ISEB 2430",
