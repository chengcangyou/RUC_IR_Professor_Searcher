I'm passionate about research and teaching in computer science, specifically the theory of algorithms and complexity. dblp DBLP Google Scholar Scholar ORCID ORCID GitHub GitHub Research I design efficient algorithms for discrete problems and prove intractability results. My research focuses on combinatorial counting problems, algebraic graph algorithms, and methods from complexity theory. Most recently, I published work on Solving Polynomial Equations Over Finite Fields. I also have an ongoing DFG-project on the Parameterized Complexity of Network Dynamics. Example: Network Dynamics Teaching I teach in a student-centered way and put an emphasis on carefully crafted exercises and assignments. My approach is inspired by alternative grading methods, particularly the Grading for Growth philosophy. I am currently working on Algo-Learn, a self-testing e-learning platform for typical undergraduate courses in algorithms and data structures, in which exercises are generated and graded programmatically. Curriculum Vitae I joined ITU Copenhagen as Associate Professor in 2019. In the past, I was Professor at Goethe University Frankfurt, Independent Research Group Leader at Saarland University, and Postdoc at UC Berkeley, Paris Diderot, and UW Madison. I obtained my PhD at Humboldt University Berlin in 2011, under the supervision of Martin Grohe. Address IT University of Copenhagen Rued Langgaards Vej 7 DK-2300 København S Denmark",
