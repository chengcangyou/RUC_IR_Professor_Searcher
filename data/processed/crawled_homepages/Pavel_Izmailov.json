I am also a member of the NYU CILVR Group. I am also a Researcher at Anthropic. I am primarily interested in reinforcement learning, reasoning, AI for science and AI alignment. Previously, I worked on reasoning and superintelligent AI alignment at OpenAI. My research interests are broadly in understanding how deep neural networks work. I am excited about a broad array of topics in core machine learning, including: • Problem-solving and reasoning in AI • Reinforcement learning, planning and search • Interpretability of deep learning models • AI for scientific discovery and math • Generalization and robustness of AI models • Technical AI alignment • Probabilistic deep learning, uncertainty estimation and Bayesian methods You can see some of my representative publications below. Highlights • I contributed to the Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude 4, state-of-the art reasoning and coding models. • I contributed to OpenAI o1, a new state-of-the-art in LLM reasoning. • Our work on weak-to-strong generalization was covered by a WIRED, MIT Technology Review and others. • Our work on Bayesian model selection was recognized with an Outstanding Paper Award 🏆 at ICML 2022!
