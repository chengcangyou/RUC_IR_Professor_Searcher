Barr Professor of Software Engineering University College London (UCL) Ph.D. in Computer Science, 2009 University of California, Davis I am the head of UCL's System Software Engineering Group and a member of the Centre for Research on Evolution, Search and Testing (CREST). My longtime collaborator, Santanu Dash of Royal Holloway, and I are looking for PhD students. Youâd be funded through the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Cyber Security for the Everyday, but jointly supervised by Santanu and me. This CDT has studentships for international students. Weâre interested in all applications of AI4Code (See MAPS and AI4Code meetup), but especially those focused on cybersecurity. We believe that our work on dual channel analysis gives us a unique angle of attack on problems like nonadversarial backdoors. If youâre interested, please get in touch. Santanu is also looking for a postdoc to join his MUSE project. Code combines two channels — a formal algorithmic channel that specifies a computation for a machine and a natural language channel that helps a human understand the computation. This postdoc will centre on techniques and tools that exploit both channels to analyse and repair vulnerabilities in legacy code. Click for the job advert.
