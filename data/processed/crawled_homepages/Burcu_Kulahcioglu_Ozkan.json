The increased complexity of these systems makes it more challenging to produce correct software. My research aims to produce rigorous and practical software tools for increasing the reliability of software systems: It brings the advantages of the rigorous approaches of formal methods together with the practical approaches of sofware engineering. To this end, my research spans formal methods, model checking, software testing, and debugging with a focus on concurrent and distributed systems. You can find more in my interview “Challenges of Concurrency” at the I/O Magazine, ICT Platform Nederland. At TU Delft, I lead and take supervisory role in several research teams and projects: I lead the FORSE (Lightweight Formal Methods for Software Engineering) lab, where my team develops automated software analysis techniques for concurrent and distributed systems. Our research has been funded by personal academic research grants from the Amazon Research Award and Stellar Academic Research Grant. I am the co-PI of Ripple’s UBRI program at TU Delft together with Annibale Panichella. Our lab focuses on testing and debugging blockchain systems and their applications. I lead a research track of the TU Delft - JetBrains collaboration, AI4SE. Our track aims to utilize the runtime information to improve software development and quality. News: Looking forward to give an invited talk at the Bits&Chips Event, Exhibition and conference on challenges in complex software engineering, AI in high-tech, and systems architecture, will be held on 20 November 2025, in Eindhoven. Looking forward to give an invited talk at the 28th edition of the Dutch Testing Day (Nederlandse Testdag), will be held on 31 October 2025, in Utrecht. LinkedIn post here.
