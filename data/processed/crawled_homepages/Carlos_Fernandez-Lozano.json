Affiliated Researcher at the Centre for Information and Communications Technology Research (CITIC). I obtained my PhD in computer science in 2014 from UDC and in 2020 a MSc in Bioinformatics from the Open University of Catalonia and the University of Barcelona. During my PhD, I was also a visiting student at the University of Parma (supervisor: Dr. Stefano Cagnoni) and University of Bristol (supervisor: Dr. Colin Campbell). Before joining the UDC in 2018, I held a Juan de la Cierva - Formación (FJCI-2015-26071), a highly competitive research grant with a 13.46% success rate (in the Computer Science and Information Technology call) at the Institute of Biomedical Research of A Coruña (INIBIC). During this fellowship, I was also a visiting scholar at the Stanford University under the supervision of Dr. Christina Curtis. Current research lines include the conception and development of multi-omic data integration strategies with special focus on genome, transcriptome and metagenome data to monitor complex and multifactorial diseases. Hence, I am committed to build a research program on how biological interactions are manifested at the disease level through the use, development and application of kernel-based integrative computational approaches. Carved out a distinguished academic and research career, culminating in the establishment of his own research laboratory in September 2023 – the Machine Learning in Life Sciences Laboratory.
