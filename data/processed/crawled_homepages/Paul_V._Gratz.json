Background: My research interests include efficient, secure and reliable design in the context of high performance computer architecture, processor memory systems and on-chip interconnection networks.  I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering from The University of Florida in 1994 and 1997 respectively.  From 1997 to 2002 I was a design engineer with Intel Corporation. I received my Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 2008.  My paper, “Synchronized Progress in Interconnection Networks (SPIN): A New Theory for Deadlock Freedom”, was selected as a Top Pick from the architecture conferences in 2018 by IEEE Micro. My papers “Path Confidence based Lookahead Prefetching” and “B-Fetch: Branch Prediction Directed Prefetching for Chip-Multiprocessors” were nominated for best papers at MICRO ’16 and MICRO ’14 respectively.  At ASPLOS ’09, I received a best paper award for “An Evaluation of the TRIPS Computer System.”  In 2016, I received the “Distinguished Achievement Award in Teaching – College Level” from the Texas A&M Association of Former Students, and in 2017, I received the “Excellence Award in Teaching, 2017” from the Texas A&M College of Engineering.
