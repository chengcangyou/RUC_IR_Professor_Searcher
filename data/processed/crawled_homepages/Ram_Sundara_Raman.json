My research uses empirical methods to detect, analyze and prevent large-scale threats to the security and privacy of Internet users. I lead the RANDLab Research Group at UC Santa Cruz, where we work on a wide range of systems, networking, security, and privacy problems. My group builds empirical methods, systems, and data-driven analysis methods to study connection tampering attacks such as Internet censorship globally, offering insights into key network security events and the role of advanced network technology. We also build, analyze, and optimize network defense mechanisms, such as censorship circumvention and anonymity tools. My group also addresses key privacy issues that users and organizations alike face in today's online ecosystems. My research work has helped produce the Censored Planet Observatory, a global measurement platform for the continuous monitoring of various types of network interference. My Research Group I lead the Research on Attacks on Networks and Defenses Lab (RANDLab) at UCSC. Current members of our group include: Ramon Torres (PhD Student), Sabrina Reis (PhD Student), Mohamed Dawoud (PhD Student), Linden Chen (PhD Student), Rohit Nagubandi (Masters Student), Michael Kamensky (Undergraduate Student), Peter Dobbins (Undergraduate Student), Dominick Rangel (Undergraduate Student), Felicity Shih (Undergraduate Student), Sriya Katreddi (Undergraduate Student) Meet our full team here. We are always interested in working with new students and collaborators. Go here for more information.
