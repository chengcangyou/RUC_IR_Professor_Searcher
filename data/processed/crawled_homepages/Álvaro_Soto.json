Welcome!, here I share my effort to contribute to the quest to build “intelligent” machines, i.e., machines that “think” using Artificial Intelligence. My main interest is cognition, i.e., understand how a machine can acquire knowledge through experience and thought. My approach follows the machine learning school, i.e., unravel how we can teach machines to learn. We live exciting times to create AI technologies. Currently, we are surrounded by all kinds of machines that are still very foolish. This opens tons of opportunities to impact society by helping to push the technological boundary. Autonomous robots able to operate in natural environments and computer programs able to understand web data are some of the exciting new applications where advanced AI techniques will make a huge impact.",
