Hsu National Taiwan University Home Research Blogs & Updates News & Demo Publications Services Team & Awards Teaching Datasets Contact Curriculum Vitae (CV) Gallery Biography Prof. Winston Hsu (徐宏民, and CV) is an active researcher dedicated to visual recognition, machine intelligence, large-scale image/video retrieval/mining, and robot learning. He is keen to realizing advanced researches towards business deliverables via academia-industry collaborations. He is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University and was the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and Vice President for MobileDrive (富智捷), a new joint venture between FIH/Foxconn and Stellantis (#4 automaker in the world, from Nov. 2021 to Nov. 2024), focusing on advancing digital cockpit and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) in HPC-based solutions.. He co-founded, thingnario, an AI/IoT SaaS startup for optimizing renewable energy and power grid. He founded MiRA (Multimedia indexing, Retrieval, and Analysis) research group and co-leads Communication and Multimedia Lab (CMLab). He and his team have been recognized with technical awards in multimedia and computer vision research communities. Working closely with the industry, he was a Visiting Scientist at Microsoft Research Redmond (2014) and had his 1-year sabbatical leave (2016-2017) at IBM TJ Watson Research Center, New York, to enhance Watson’s visual cognition, where he contributed the first AI produced movie trailer. He is the Founding Director for NVIDIA AI Lab (NTU), the 1st in Asia. Having investigated deep neural networks for numerous image/video challenges, recently, he is also helping companies set up the AI/deep learning teams for advanced products. He received Ph.D. (2007) from Columbia University, New York, under the supervision of Prof. Shih-Fu Chang. Before that, he was a founding engineer and research manager in CyberLink Corp, now a public image/video software company. He serves as the Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (TCSVT) and IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, two premier journals, and was in the Editorial Board for IEEE Multimedia Magazine  (2010 – 2017). He is also a columnist for DIGITIMES for the machine learning aspect. He also served as Director/Board Members for Columbia Alumni Association of Taiwan. The public publication list can be found in DBLP and  Google Citations (with citations).  He is in the list of “World’s Top 2% Scientists (2023/2024).” Currently focusing on Embodied AI research, integrating technologies such as “Perception,” “Action,” and “Learning” for brand-new applications in automotive and robotics. This effort is carried out in collaboration with global tech companies (see recent publications and reports). He is proud to be a Christian, a marathoner, a triathlete, and a father of three. In his internationally competitive research group, he is always looking forward to working closely, as a partner, with enthusiastic and motivated team members for the exciting projects. Feel free to contact for further opportunities as postdocs, research assistants, and (PhD, master, undergraduate) students. See more details in the (international) news reports.
