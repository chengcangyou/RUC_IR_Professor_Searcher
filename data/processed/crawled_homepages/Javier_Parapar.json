My research interests include information retrieval, text mining, document engineering, text summarization, and recommender systems. Recently, my work has focused on modeling item recommendation as a relevance ranking problem, exploring pseudo-relevance feedback for opinion mining, and applying text mining techniques for early risk prediction on the Internet. I have been organizing the eRisk Lab since 2017, where we specifically research early risk detection on social media. For more information about my technology transfer activities, I invite you to visit the IRLab, which is part of our work with CITIC, the Research Center on Information and Communication Technologies at the University of A CoruÃ±a. I completed my Ph.D. thesis under the supervision of Professor Ãlvaro Barreiro, focusing on new estimations and applications of Relevance-Based Language Models. After organizing the CERI 2014 conference in A CoruÃ±a, I was elected President of the Spanish Society for Information Retrieval (SERI). You can join us here.

In this work, we make use of one of these techniques, Normalised Cut, in order to derive a cluster-based collaborative filtering algorithm which outperforms other standard techniques in the state-of-the-art in terms of ranking precision. We frame this technique as a method for neighbour selection, and we show its effectiveness when compared with other cluster-based methods. Furthermore, the performance of our method could be improved if standard similarity metrics -such as Pearson correlation- are also used when predicting the rating score.

The objetive of the program is to provide with the first step in the scientific carrer of young Galician researchers with the final aim of integrate those researchers in the Galicia R&D system after the defence of their Ph.D. thesis. Research Most of my research in framed on the Information Retrieval (IR) area. IR techniques have become essential for the daily activity of most of the human beings. Nowadays the homepage of almost every web browser installed in personal computers points to a web search engine such as Google, Yahoo! or Bing, this is not only for marketing purposes, but also, and more importantly, it is because today the search engines are vital to access information. And those search engines would not be possible without the research efforts made on the Information Retrieval ï¬eld. Information Retrieval is in fact the science of searching, or maybe a better description could be the science of finding However, IR is not only searching for relevant documents, and neither my investigation is only on IR. In my research, I have also dealt with text mining and natural language processing techniques in tasks such as opinion mining and retrieval, text categorization, blog and news search, unsupervised and semi-supervised text categorization, pseudo-relevance feedback, item recommendation, document processing and engineering, retrieval of degraded information or text summarization. I have contributed to the IR community reviewing articles for ACM SIGIR, ACM CIKM, ACM RecSys, WWW, BCS ECIR, SPIRE, ACM ICTIR, SERI CERI and journals such Elsevier Information Processing and Management, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, ACM Transactions on Information Systems, ACM Computing Surveys, Elsevier Data & Knowledge Engineering or the Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology. I am an editorial board member of Elsevier Information Processing and Management.

Research Projects PID2022-137061OB-C21 C3HS Content Curation for Consumer Health Search One of the most pressing challenges in Information Access today is combating the spread of misinformation. Existing methods for misinformation detection employ techniques such as neural network models, statistical methods, linguistic analysis, and fact-checking strategies. However, the threat of false information has intensified with the emergence of highly creative language models. Misinformation on the web and social media poses significant social, economic, and political repercussions, leading to serious consequences such as election interference, polarization, and violence. This issue becomes particularly critical during global health crises, as misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic can result in catastrophic health outcomes. We have witnessed numerous myths proliferate on social media regarding COVID-19 treatments, the virality of the virus, and misleading narratives targeting marginalized communities. This challenge is especially pronounced in developing countries, where low literacy rates and limited exposure to technology hinder effective fake news detection. Nonetheless, increased access to affordable internet makes these populations more susceptible to believing and acting on misinformation. Web search is a prevalent means of seeking online information, particularly regarding health-related advice. This area of web search is commonly referred to as Consumer Health Search. Accessing reliable health-related information necessitates retrieval algorithms capable of promoting trustworthy documents while filtering out unreliable ones. To achieve this, we aim to integrate various components, including query-document matching features, passage relevance estimation, reliability assessments, and suitable recommendation models. Our project seeks to establish a comprehensive pipeline for misinformation detection by fusing multiple features and complementary tools. We aspire to intelligently combine advanced techniques from diverse fields such as Information Retrieval, Text Classification, Recommendation, and Natural Language Processing to design effective content curation strategies for consumer health search tasks. This project is distinctly multidisciplinary, encompassing aspects of Text Processing (Information Retrieval, Automatic Text Classification, Personalization, and Recommender Systems), Computational Linguistics (Discourse Analysis, Advanced Natural Language Processing), and High-Performance Computing for Big Data. Furthermore, our team includes experts in Psychology, who will tackle challenges related to incorporating expert knowledge into the models, validating the resulting technologies, and applying the project outcomes in real-world contexts.
