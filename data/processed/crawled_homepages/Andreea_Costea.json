I am particularly interested in the area of software verification for critical code, program synthesis and automated program repair. I completed my PhD at the School of Computing, NUS, in the CS Department, where I later worked in the Programming Languages and Software Engineering lab. During this time, I was affiliated with and collaborated closely with the Automated Program Repair team, the Trustworthy and Secure Software and the VERSE lab. Looking for motivated PhD students! Do reach out if you're interested in discussing research opportunities in Formal Methods applied to Softwre Engineering problems at TU Delft. Position details HERE. Teaching Team News Publications Talks Projects Service News Apr 2025. First time attending and presenting at ICT.Open. Seeing the many ways formal methods are benefiting industry is a powerful reminder of their real-world relevance — and why it's so important to stay closely connected with the industry. Feb 2025. Thoroughly enjoyed the provocative discussions at the IFIP Software Implementation Technology WG 2.4 meeting 70 in Singapore. Feb 2025. Welcome to MSc student Arjan Seijs. Arjan will be working on a static analysis tool for bug detection in unsafe Rust code. Feb 2025. Welcome to MSc student Jim van Vliet. Jim tries to ease Rust code debugging for bugs detected via Property Based Testing. Feb 2025. Welcome to MSc student Timen Zandbergen. Co-advised by Mara Bos and Jana Dönszelmann, Timen is trying to understand what safety properties can (or cannot) be maintained when linking separately compiled Rust code. Dec 2024. Welcome to MSc student Matteo Bertorotta. Co-advised by Sebastijan Dumancic, Matteo is looking at program synthesis with e-graphs. Dec 2024. Welcome to MSc student Julius de Jeu. Co-advised by Jonathan Dönszelmann, Julius is investigating what can go wrong with FFIs in Rust programs. Dec 2024. Welcome to MSc student Arthur de Groot. Co-advised by Aron Zwaan and Jonathan Dönszelmann, Arthur is designig a new algorithm for name resolution using scope graphs. Oct 2024. Attending the Automated Programming and Program Repair seminar at Dagstuhl. Oct 2024. Thrilled to be joining EEMCS at TU Delft this October! Feb 2024. Join our APR workshop during the recess week. Nov 2023. Celebrating a 1 year of progress in the APR project with an engaging lineup of talks! Oct 2023. Looking forward to connect at SPLASH in Lisbon. Come check out our Rust refactoring talk. Mar 2023. It was exciting participating in the Dagstuhl Seminar on Unifying Formal Methods for Trustworthy Distributed Systems ! Feb 2022. Exciting news: our APR team has been awarded a Ministry of Education Tier 3 grant in order to pursue its vision for the programming experience of tomorrow. Get in touch if we share similar pursuits, if you're a Rustacean wanting to enahnce the Rust ecosystem, or if APR is your cup of tea. Join us! Jan 2022. Had an inspiring conversation about how to tackle some of the challenges a computer scientist faces at different career stages PLMW @ POPL2022. Jan 2022. Glad to announce that I have officialy joined the Sofware Engineering group in NUS, working with Abhik Roychoudhury and other enthusiastic researchers on program repair.
