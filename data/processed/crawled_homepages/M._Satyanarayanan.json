I'm a faculty member in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.  As an experimental computer scientist, I design, implement, and evaluate systems. My motto is \"Working Code Trumps All Hype.\"  My multi-decade research career has focused on the challenges of performance, scalability, availability and trust in information systems that reach from the cloud to the mobile edge of the Internet.    Here are:  all my publications, a short bio, and a longer bio.My email is satya@cs.cmu.edu.   Emily Spencer (emilyspe@andrew.cmu.edu, (412)-268-5566) is my admin assistant  and keeps my schedule.  Contact her if you'd like to set up an in-person or virtual meeting.  My office is in the Gates Hillman Center (GHC 9123)  (you can find CMU maps here)Some  useful links relating to my current or past work:Living Edge LabOpen Edge Computing InitiativeElijah  and Gabriel (edge computing, cloudlets, wearable cognitive assistance)Olive  (archiving of executable content)Diamond (unstructured data search, especially image data)OpenSlide (digital pathology)Internet Suspend/Resume  (your PC anywhere, hands-free)Coda (disconnected and weakly-connected operation, server replication)OpenAFS (the original cloud storage mechanism from the mid-1980s, inspiration for DropBox)IEEE Pervasive ComputingCarnegie Mellon University",
