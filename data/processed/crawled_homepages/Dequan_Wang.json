My research lies at the intersection of Agentic AI and Life Sciences, developing generative AI that treats living cells as programmable machines. I am particularly interested in leveraging large-scale models and multi-agent systems to decode complex biological processes more efficiently and effectively. I completed my Ph.D. at University of California, Berkeley, advised by Prof. Trevor Darrell, and earned my B.S. from Fudan University.
