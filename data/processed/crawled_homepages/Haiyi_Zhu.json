Siewiorek Associate Professor of Human-Computer Interaction and the Director of HCI Undergraduate Programs at Carnegie Mellon University. I also direct the Social AI group at CMU. My research focuses on human-computer interaction and responsible AI, supported by multiple programs at the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Mental Health, and various industry sponsors. I have received over ten paper awards at venues such as CHI, CSCW, Human Factors, and CHIWORK, as well as the Allen Newell Award for Research Excellence. My name in Chinese characters is: 朱海一. About my research I study Human-AI Interaction, Social Computing, and Responsible AI. My research focuses on the integration of AI technologies and algorithms into various aspects of social groups, communities, and organizations to improve, automate, or optimize social processes, interactions, and decision-making. I explore how we can enhance the benefits of these technologies while reducing potential harms. I have conducted several projects focused on the design and use of AI in real-world domains such as child welfare, mental health support, and various workplace settings. You can download my CV here.
