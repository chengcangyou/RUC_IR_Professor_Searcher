Hi, I am Prof. Nava Tintarev I am a Full Professor in Explainable AI at Maastricht University in the Department of Advanced Computing Sciences (DACS) where I am the Director of Research. My research is funded by projects in the field of human-computer interaction in artificial advice-giving systems, such as recommender systems; specifically developing the state-of-the-art for automatically generated explanations (transparency) and explanation interfaces (recourse and control). I was a founding Co-Investigator in the ROBUST consortium to carry out long term (10-years, ~87M, NWO+EZK+private funding) research into trustworthy artificial intelligence. I am currently a co-lab director of the ICAI TAIM lab, working on trustworthy media, in collaboration with UvA and RTL. Previous funders include the European Commission, IBM, and Twitter. Senior ACM member since 2020, round table member for informatics (informaticatafel, since 2024), and board member ICT-Research Platform Netherlands , (IPN, incoming 2026).

Team As research director I coordinated a department of 100 researchers, and I am a line manager of 11 assistant/associate professors, postdocs, and PhDs. I am also a member of the Explainable AI (XAI) research theme, which is an interdisciplinary field of research focusing on providing explanations of AI-driven systems. This includes intrinsically explainable approaches to AI, as well as methods that provide explanations for decisions made by \"black-box\" machine learning models. The ability of AI-driven systems to explain their decisions in human-understandable terms improves the trust we place in these systems and helps address issues related to fair and unbiased decision-making. We bring together researchers working on XAI in a diverse range of application areas, including recommender systems, computational social science, causal inference for life sciences, affective computing, computer vision, knowledge representation/reasoning and machine learning. We have expertise on interactive interfaces for XAI, computational argumentation for XAI, and the evaluation of XAI systems.
