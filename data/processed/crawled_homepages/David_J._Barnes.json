This has found expression in the writing of textbooks, the most recent of which is the 7th edition of Objects First with Java (https://www.pearson.com/en-us/pearsonplus/p/9780138123215 and https://www.bluej.org/objects-first/) with Michael Kölling. Research interests I belong to the Artificial Intelligence and Data Science group.I am particularly interested in and excited by the impact of AI on the teaching of introductory programming.I am the author and long-term maintainer of the widely-used open source pgn-extract program for manipulating chess games written in the Portable Game Notation (PGN)  (https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/~djb/pgn-extract and https://github.com/kentdjb/pgn-extract/).
