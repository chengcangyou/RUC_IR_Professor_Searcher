  "content": "Index Research I care about Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) security. Today FPGAs are used in everything from datacenters to airplanes, so ensuring secure FPGA operations is rapidly becoming as critical as processor-based systems. My students and I help design new security layers for existing FPGAs and designs for new FPGA architectures focused on improved security. Our group is currently focused on three main projects: FPGA bitstream tamper prevention FPGA piracy detection Security of non-volatile FPGA architectures For more details, please check out our research group, SAIL-IN. If you are interested in pursuing a PhD in FPGA or embedded systems security, please contact me! Teaching I am currently teaching ENGR-315 \"Hardware/Software Codesign\".",
