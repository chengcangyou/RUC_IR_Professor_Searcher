Kim Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Cornell University mpk@cs. about My research investigates foundational questions about responsible machine learning. Much of this work aims to identify problematic behaviors that emerge in machine-learned models and to develop algorithmic tools that provably mitigate such behaviors. More broadly, I am interested in how the theory of computation can provide insight into emerging societal and scientific challenges. Prior to Cornell, I was a Miller Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Berkeley, hosted by Shafi Goldwasser. I completed my Ph.D. in the Stanford Theory Group under the guidance of Omer Reingold. selected publications [all] [scholar] Near-Optimal Algorithms for Omniprediction [arXiv] Princewill Okoroafor, Robert Kleinberg, MPK FOCS 2025 Certifying Private Probabilistic Mechanisms [IACR] Zoe Ruha Bell, Shafi Goldwasser, MPK, Jean-Luc Watson CRYPTO 2024 Planting Undetectable Backdoors in Machine Learning Models [arXiv] [Quanta] Shafi Goldwasser, MPK, Vinod Vaikuntanathan, Or Zamir FOCS 2022 Outcome Indistinguishability [arXiv] [ECCC] Cynthia Dwork, MPK, Omer Reingold, Guy N.
