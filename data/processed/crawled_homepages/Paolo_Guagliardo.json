  "content": "My research work lies at the intersection of database theory and practice, with a strong emphasis on making theoretical results applicable in real-life systems. I am a co-Investigator in the EPSRC Programme Grant VADA: Value Added Data Systems; my current focus is on devising and implementing principled and practical solutions for dealing with incomplete information in relational database systems, and on the analysis of concrete query languages for graph databases (in cooperation with Neo Technology). I obtained a PhD in Computer Science from the Free-University of Bozen-Bolzano, a joint MSc degree in Computational Logic from the Vienna University of Technology and the Free-University of Bozen-Bolzano, and a BSc degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Palermo.
