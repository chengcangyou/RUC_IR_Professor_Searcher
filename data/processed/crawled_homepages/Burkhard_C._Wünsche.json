I am also the director of the Graphics Group and of the division for Biomedical Imaging & Visualization My PhD was in collaboration with the Bioengineering Institute of the University of Auckland and is titled A Toolkit for Visualizing Biomedical Tensor Fields in Finite Element Data Sets. Note that even though I am correctly spelled Wünsche my official spelling here is Wuensche. Research Interests Scientific and Biomedical Visualization, Medical Imaging, Information Visualization Computer Graphics, Game Technology Computer Aided Geometric Design, Simulation Algorithms Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) Human Computer Interfaces (HCI), Computer Vision, Cognitive Psychology Presentation of research themes (July 2011). Research Supervision I am interested in supervising MSc and PhD theses and undergraduate and graduate projects in all research areas related to Computer Graphics including Game Technology, Computer Art, Biomedical Imaging & Visualization, Physically-based modelling, and cognitive psychology. A list of potential project and thesis topics can be obtained on request though I am more than happy if you propose your own research topic to me :-) So far I have supervised these students.
