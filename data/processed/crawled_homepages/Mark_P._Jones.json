Jones Publications I am a professor in the Department of Computer Science in the Maseeh College of Engineering & Computer Science at Portland State University in Portland, Oregon, USA. I am currently on sabbatical (until June 2026) after serving as department chair for six years, from August 2019 until August 2025. My PSU Profile has a few more details. My research interests include all aspects of programming language design, implementation, and application. I am particularly interested in the use of advanced programming language technologies for low-level systems programming, and in the development and application of expressive type systems and language abstractions that support the construction and certification of secure and reliable software systems. [Caveat: In my current role of department chair, I am focussed on administrative work and do not have much time for research.] I am the original designer and implementor of the Gofer and Hugs systems. People still ask me about Timbot. I developed a course on Languages and Low-Level Programming; and I have since reimplemented several of the associated lab examples using mil-tools.
