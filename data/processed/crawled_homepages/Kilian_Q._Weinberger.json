If you are interested in more, you can earn an official Machine Learning Certificate through eCornell with especially designed problem sheets and high quality videos (with fancy 3D animations). Here is a video, if you want to learn more about my research philosophy. Bio: Kilian Weinberger is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in Machine Learning under the supervision of Lawrence Saul and his undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Computing from the University of Oxford. During his career he has won several best paper awards at ICML (2004), CVPR (2004, 2017), AISTATS (2005) and KDD (2014, runner-up award). In 2011 he was awarded the Outstanding AAAI Senior Program Chair Award and in 2012 he received an NSF CAREER award. He is the recipient of the Daniel M Lazar '29 Excellence in Teaching Award (2016) and the Ann S. Bowers Teaching and Advising Excellence Award (2024). As of 2024 he is an ACM and AAAI fellow and in 2021 became a Blavatnik National Awards Finalists. He was elected co-Program Chair for ICML 2016 and for AAAI 2018 and has been on the ICML board since 2016. He served as president of the ICML society from 2023-2025. Since 2024 he has been a member of the Sloan Research Fellowships Selection Committee. Kilian Weinberger's research focuses on Machine Learning and its applications. In particular, he has worked on learning under resource constraints, metric learning, AI in Science, computer vision, autonomous vehicles, Gaussian Processes, and deep learning. Before joining Cornell University, he was an Associate Professor at Washington University in St. Louis and before that he worked as a research scientist at Yahoo! Research in Santa Clara. (C.V..) Interested in joining my lab as Ph.D. student? Please take a look at this page. If you are a Cornell student and want to get in contact with me, please just show up to my office hours (see link in side bar). Please do not email me unless absolutely necessary. About me: I am married to (the amazing) Anne Bracy. Together we have three children, Timo, Koby and Nika. In my spare time I like running, reading, skiing, mountain biking, or boating on Cayuga Lake. Some books that I really enjoyed are The Three Body Problem Trilogy, a Gentleman in Moscow, The things they carried, and Never Let Me Go. Kilian Q.
