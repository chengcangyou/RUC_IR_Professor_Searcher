She is co-founder of the AIM for Health Lab at Monash IT and a research affiliate with the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine. She received her Ph.D. from the University of Melbourne in 2018 (Australia), Master of Computer Science (by research) in medical image analytics in 2013 from the University of Ain Shams (Egypt). Yasmeen worked as associate lecturer and research fellow at the University of Melbourne, teaching data science related subjects and implementing AI-based solutions for event detection and social media analytics. Prior to joining Monash, Yasmeen worked as research scientist with IBM Research Australia focusing on the use of AI for retinal disease diagnosis and patient monitoring, deep reinforcement learning and interpretability in machine learning. Her research focuses on the use of AI for automated medical image analysis for better management of various health conditions including,  cancer (kidney, breast, skin, brain), glaucoma, psoriasis. She worked on various research projects in AI for automatic systematic reviews, cancer segmentation and classification, disease severity assessment and lesion detection using different data modalities (text, numerical, 2D images, and 3D volumes). Her research work is recognised through several research publications, 2 patents, several invited talks, and prestigious research grants including MRFF and NHMRC. Research interestsArtificial intelligence, machine learning, medical image analysis, image/video analytics, healthcare/data analytics across domains of radiology, dermatology, neurology, oncology and ophthalmology. Expertise related to UN Sustainable Development Goals In 2015, UN member states agreed to 17 global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all.
