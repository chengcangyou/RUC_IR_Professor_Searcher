Previously, I worked on lower bounds and data privacy as a Google Research Fellow at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at UC Berkeley, and was a postdoctoral researcher in the Theory of Computation Group at Princeton University where I was hosted by Mark Zhandry. I completed my Ph.D. in computer science at Harvard University in 2016, where I was very fortunate to have Salil Vadhan as my advisor. As an undergraduate, I studied math and computer science at the University of Washington. I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science, including data privacy, computational complexity, cryptography, and the foundations of machine learning. My current research focuses on Using the methodologies of complexity theory to answer practically-motivated questions in algorithmic data privacy, and Understanding the power of real polynomial approximations to Boolean functions and their applications in quantum computation, communication complexity, and learning theory.
