My area of expertise is Artificial Intelligence and Robotics with the focus on knowledge representation and reasoning under real-time conditions. My application areas fall within the Semantic Web and Multi-Agent Systems areas. My long-term research goal is to combine the two areas making use of technology that has been developed for one area in the other. One example for this flows into my current research proposals: the combination of autonomous intelligent agents using semantic web technology. Check out my research page for details.   My research has been funded by federal agencies in the USA, in Europe, and in Australia such as the European Commission (EC), the National Institute of Health (NIH), and the Australian Research Council (ARC) as well as by industry such as Microsoft and German Telekom.   I am a member of the Editorial Board of two International Journals: the German AI journal and the Advanced Robotics Journal. I have published > 160 research articles, and have been a keynote speaker at international conferences, and regularly serve as a research expert for the NSF/NIH, NASA, the European Commission, the German Research Council (DFG & BMBF).   I am a Trustee and President of the RoboCup Federation, one of the largest Robotics and AI organizations in the world promoting robotics and AI research by offering publicly appealing, but formidable challenges (RoboCupSoccer, RoboCupRescue, RoboCup@Home).
