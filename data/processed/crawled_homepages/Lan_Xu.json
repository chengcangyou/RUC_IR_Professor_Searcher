I received my Ph.D from HKUST in 2020 supervised by Prof. Lu Fang and B.E. from ZJU in 2015. I used to spend 18 months working with Prof. Yebin Liu in Tsinghua University from 2016. Later, I visited the GVV group in MPI for a year hosted by Prof. Christian Theobalt in 2018. My research focuses on computer vision and computer graphics. My goal is to capture, perceive and understand the human-centric dynamic and static scenes in the complex real world.
