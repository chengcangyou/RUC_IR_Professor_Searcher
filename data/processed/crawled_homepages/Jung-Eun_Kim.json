I work on trustworthy, interpretable, and efficient AI/deep learning. My interest lies in the intersection of failure mode/safety risk/vulnerability/bias and efficiency of deep learning. I also have a background in safety-critical systems. Prior to joining NC State in 2022, I was an assistant professor in EECS at Syracuse University (2021-2022.) Before then, I was an associate research scientist in Computer Science at Yale University. I received my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and my BS and MS degrees in Computer Science and Engineering at Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea. jung-eun.kim@ncsu.edu Available Positions I am looking for genuinely motivated PhD students. If you are interested in working with me for a PhD program, please contact me with your CV and mention your research interests and experiences with regard to mine. Research Focus of Our Group In our group, we care about trustworthy, interpretable, and efficient AI/deep learning. We identify how models can go wrong and answer why. We fundamentally anatomize neural networks to understand and verify what is invariant in them and what causes failure modes/safety risks/vulnerabilities/biases. Deep learning is used to generalize to high-dimensional problems – if you already know what to encounter, you must program it instead. However, such aforementioned issues hurt the generalizability and exacerbate memorization behaviors of AI/deep learning models. Also, when these issues meet efficiency considerations, we may gain or lose something. So, like a heart surgeon, we open the heart of a neural network architecture, look into it, interpret it, and cure it. This is our mission, and we are savvy about them.

They can be removed from the dataset even if one cannot determine/infer what spurious features/correlations are present in the dataset, to mitigate spurious correlations. “The Over-Certainty Phenomenon in Modern Test-Time Adaptation Algorithms“ Fin Amin and Jung-Eun Kim Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR) 2025 [arXiv] “RESQUE: Quantifying Estimator to Task and Distribution Shift for Sustainable Model Reusability” Vishwesh Sangarya and Jung-Eun Kim The Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) 2025 [arXiv] [code] News coverage (Highlighted in ACM Tech News) “Security Before Safety: A Backdoor-Centric View of LLM Output Risks in the Private AI Era” (Position paper) Jianwei Li and Jung-Eun Kim [preprint] “Trustworthy AI: Safety, Bias, and Privacy – A Survey” Xingli Fang *, Jianwei Li *, Varun Mulchandani *, and Jung-Eun Kim, * Equal contribution.
