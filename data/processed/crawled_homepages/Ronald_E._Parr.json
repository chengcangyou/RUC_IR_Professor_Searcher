Before you send me an email that I probably won't be able to answer, please look here. I am a professor at the Duke University Department of Computer Science. From July 2015 through June 2017, I was department chair and delivered three graduation speeches: 2015, 2016, and 2017. Here is my CV (updated 1/2025) and and brief bio.
