Department Computer Science and Information Technologies Knowledgment area Computational Science and Artificial Intelligence Research Research group Laboratorio de Investigación y Desarrollo en Inteligencia Artificial Research lines My research focus is on the development of artificial intelligence systems applied to complex problems generally in the health field. Among past developments we can highlight the MIASoft system for the diagnosis of sleep apnea (based on fuzzy logic), the PROSAICO system for the development of personalized training plans for physical activities in sport facilities (based on a constraint-satisfaction system) or the intelligent monitoring system PATRICIA (I was responsible for its validation process). Within the LIDIA group, I initiated a new line of research consisting of the development of new methods and techniques for the analysis of the usability of systems. Within this line, I co-developed a taxonomy of usability analysis criteria that has been widely cited as an example of modern \"extended usability models\". Nowadays my research focus is on defining new types of interaction between humans and machine learning algorithms known as ¿Human-in-the-Loop Machine Learning¿ and its application to the detection and treatment of different types of cancer. Within this line, I am the principal investigator of the project ¿Analysis of human-in-the-loop machine learning strategies and its application to pancreatic cancer research (HITL-ML)¿, financed by the Ministry of Science and Innovation in the 2019 call. Another recent research focus is Quantum Computing. Currently I am a research member of the NEASQC (NExt ApplicationS of Quantum Computing) European project that brings together academic experts and industrial end-users to investigate and develop a new breed of Quantum-enabled applications that can take advantage of NISQ (Noise Intermediate-Scale Quantum) systems in the near future. NEASQC is use-case driven, addressing practical problems. My participation is in the use case ¿quantum rule-based systems (QRBS) for breast cancer detection¿.
