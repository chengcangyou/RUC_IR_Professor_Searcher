Before that I was working at Ruhr University Bochum (RUB), Germany, in the DFG Cluster of Excellence “Cyber Security in the Age of Large-Scale Adversaries“ (CASA). Our research covers various attacks on machine learning models, including LLMs and generative AI across all types of media and multimodal models. We aim to develop domain-adaptive detection mechanisms and countermeasures, focusing on preventing the misuse of AI-generated media and enhancing model robustness. During my Ph.D., I focused on the robustness of neural networks and the security of speech-based systems. I received my Ph.D. in 2021 from Ruhr University Bochum, where I was advised by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Dorothea Kolossa at the Cognitive Signal Processing group at Ruhr University Bochum (RUB), Germany. I received two scholarships from UbiCrypt (DFG Research Training Group) and CASA (DFG Cluster of Excellence). I obtained my Master's degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology at RUB in 2015 after graduating from the University of Applied Science in Mannheim in Biomedical Engineering. ·
