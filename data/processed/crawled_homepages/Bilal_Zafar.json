I am also a PI at the Cluster of Excellence CASA and a member of the Horst Görtz Institute for IT Security. Previously I was a Senior Applied Scientist at Amazon Web Services (AWS) in Berlin, Germany where I was building products to support trustworthy use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Before joining AWS, I was a Research Scientist at Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence in Renningen, Germany. I did my PhD at Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS) and Saarland University. I was co-advised by Krishna P. Gummadi and Manuel Gomez Rodriguez. My research interests are in the area of human-centric AI/ML. My work aims to address challenges that arise when AI/ML models interact with human users. For instance, I develop algorithms for making AI/ML models more fair, explainable and robust.
