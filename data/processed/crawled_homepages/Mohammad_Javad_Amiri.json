Before joining Stony Brook, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Computer and Information Science department at the University of Pennsylvania. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara and my M.S. and B.S. in Computer Engineering at the Iran University of Science and Technology. My research mainly lies at the intersection of data management and distributed systems, focusing on distributed transaction processing, consensus protocols, and blockchains.
