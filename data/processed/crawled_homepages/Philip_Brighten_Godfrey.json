Office: 3211 Siebel Center Email: pbg at illinois dot edu I am a professor in the Department of Computer Science and the CSL at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am also a technical director at VMware, which I joined in 2019 with the acquisition of our startup Veriflow, where I was co-founder and CTO. Before joining UIUC, I was a Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley, advised by Ion Stoica, and a visiting researcher at Intel Labs Berkeley. Ph.D. applicants: I encourage you to apply to UIUC CS for the 2025 admission season. Our group is always interested in strong applicants in the broad area of networked systems. The type of work in our group spans building networked systems, applications of ML to networked systems, and algorithms and optimization for networks. Read more about our group's current research thrusts below. Apply to our PhD program and list my name as one of the faculty you are interested to work with. UIUC has a fantastic group of faculty in the Systems and Networking space and I encourage you to explore who is the best fit for you. Undergraduate research: Drop me an email with your resume and a transcript. Research | Papers | News | Group | Teaching | Service Photo: Rodrigo Fonseca Research I enjoy building networked systems that address practical problems, with strong architectural and theoretical foundations. You can check out my complete list of papers. My group is currently working in several main areas: Low latency networking including for XR/VR, web, and mobile apps: Speed of Light Internet, DChannel, HVCs Service layer networking to optimize, observe, and secure communication between microservices. See news article: CS-led team pioneers improvement of microservice-based applications. Service Layer Traffic Engineering (SLATE) upcoming in HotNets 2024, Service meshes as a new network layer, TraceWeaver: Distributed Request Tracing for Microservices Without Application Modification, expressive policies Machine learning for systems: I'm a member of the LDOS NSF Expeditions In Computing project, which is building a clean-slate Learning Directed Operating System. We've also worked on online learning for congestion control (Aurora and PCC), deep learning as an adversary, and performance diagnosis (Murphy). Network verification and diagnosis including network fault localization (Flock), diagnosing performance problems in distributed apps (Murphy), verifying self-driving infrastructure, configuration verification (Plankton), and data plane verification (Anteater and VeriFlow, which led to our startup Veriflow, now part of VMware) Other areas of work recently and in the past include: Data center network topology Compact routing and fast shortest path algorithms in social networks Flexible Internet architectures Peer-to-peer systems Recent News 2023: Congratulations to Bingzhe Liu on her Ph.D. dissertation defense! Excited to share two papers in HotNets 2023 from different thrusts of our group's work, on low latency networking for interactive applications, and expressive policies for microservice communication Our group has two upcoming talks at KubeCon 2023 in Chicago: Bingzhe Liu and Gangmuk Lim on verifying Kubernetes controllers, and Gangmuk Lim and Aditya Prerepa on service layer traffic engineering with SLATE. Congratulations to Vipul Harsh on his Ph.D. dissertation defense! Check out VMware's blog on commercial impact of Murphy, which appeared in SIGCOMM'23 I've joined the ACM SIGCOMM Steering Committee for a three-year term, 2023 - 2026. Enjoyed speaking on cISP at the Harvard Systems + Theory Seminar in February 2022: Panelist at ACM Symposium on SDN Research, on \"Broadening Software-Defined Networking\" -- check out the video Sachin Ashok and Vipul Harsh's talk at KubeCon 2022: Distributed Tracing Without The Pain SYFY Wire covered our work on designing a speed-of-light Internet which recently appeared in NSDI 2022. See also my quick summary on Twitter. Honored to be recognized with a 2022 Engineering Council Outstanding Advisor Award from the UIUC College of Engineering, which is due to an awesome group of students! I've been happy to give a few virtual talks recently: at Cambridge University on \"Software as a Network\", at the UT Austin Sys/ML Workshop on \"Towards Self-Driving Clouds Via Machine Learning\", and at Cambridge and FutureWei on cISP (video online!). 2021: Talk video now online: Adventures in Learning-Based Rate Control at the c3.ai workshop on Networks+ML in September I'll be co-chairing ACM SIGCOMM 2022 with Bruce Maggs. Check out our HotNets paper and Sachin's 10-minute talk video on Leveraging Service Meshes as a New Network Layer. A few talks this fall -- at ONUG 2021 on spineless data center networks, at NetVerify 2021, and the c3.ai workshop on Networks of Machine Learning, for Machine Learning, by Machine Learning We're excited that cISP, our project on designing an Internet that achieves nearly speed-of-light latency, will appear at NSDI 2022. Watch for the upcoming paper! Congratulations to Ph.D. graduates Tong Meng and Ali Kheradmand!
