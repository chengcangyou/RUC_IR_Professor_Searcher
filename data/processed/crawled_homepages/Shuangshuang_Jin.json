Create yours today.Get StartedThe Beauty of Computer Science is To Turn Challenges Into Opportunities AboutAbout MeI am an Associate Professor of School of Computing at College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences of Clemson University. Prior to joining this position, I was a Senior Research Scientist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. ​ My research interests lie in high-performance computing (HPC), scientific computation and visualization, general-purpose computation on graphical processing units (GPGPU), big data, and machine learning, etc. In particular, I'm interested in the application of these technologies into power system domain problems, such as power system modeling and simulation, renewable energy integration, and advanced grid analytics, etc. ​ I am looking for 1-2 highly motivated Ph.D. students to join my research group. Both CPSC and ECE students with interests in HPC and GPGPU application development for power grid simulations are highly encouraged to contact me.Read More >ResearchResearchComputer science is a discipline that spans theory and application, which has a strong connection with all other disciplines. Furthermore, when large-scale domain problems with high-throughput real-time dataset are concerned, high-performance computing (HPC) based parallel computation is extremely helpful in providing a fast and efficient technical solution. ​ My research goal is thus building a bridge between the fields of computer science and other disciplines, and applying effective and efficient HPC-based computations into pressing scientific and engineering problems, such as power grid simulation, computing biology modeling, and computer graphics acceleration, etc. ​ My current research interests are primarily focused on developing optimized HPC based parallel programming algorithms and architectures to speed up large-scale power system simulations to take advantage of the HPC resources for fast computation, and thus enabling real time or faster than real time computation with the implementation of Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP), Message Passing Interface (MPI), multithreading, and CUDA/OpenCL on shared-memory supercomputers, distributed-memory clusters, inter-connected workstations, or graphical processing units (GPU). TeachingTeachingSpring 2018 ​ CPSC8810/ECE8930: High-Performance Computing for Power System Modeling and Simulation Meeting Time: TU 2:00-4:45pm Meeting Room: McAdams 110E (Clemson), GEC 104 (CURI) Course Description: With the increasing demand, scale, and data information of power systems, fast real-time modeling and                                           simulation tools are becoming more important in power system operation and control. Improving the computational efficiency of power system applications requires parallel computing implementation of the solution methods with high-performance-computing (HPC)) capabilities. This course is designed to provide instruction in the design and implementation of HPC technologies in power system modeling and simulation through extensive examples, studies, and project demonstrations                                         , so that the students can obtain hands-on parallel programming experiences to resolve large-scale real- world complex power grid problems. Multithreading, Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) and Massive Programming Interface (MPI) will all be                                               introduced as the parallel programming tools, along with standard programming languages such as Matlab, C/C++, and Fortran, etc. Parallel solvers, existing power grid simulation tools, and parallel power                                         grid computational fram eworks will also be introduced. ​ Fall 2017, Fall 2018 ​ CPSC/ECE4780/6780: General-Purpose Computation on Graphical Processing Units (GPGPU) Meeting Time: MW 1:00-2:15pm Meeting Room: McAdams 110E (Clemson), GEC 104 (CURI) Course Description: Graphics processing units (GPU) is a term introduced by NVIDIA in the late 1990s which typically handles                                           computation only for computer graphics. After 2001, with the advent of both programmable shaders and                                         floating-point support on graphics processors, general-purpose computing on GPUs became practical                                             and popular for scientific computing applications with its increasing speed and volume of computation. Nevertheless, extracting full performance from a GPU is challenging. Parallel algorithms are necessary but                                         far from sufficient. Careful layout of both control flow patterns and memory access patterns is required to                                         avoid flow divergence and bank conflicts, which can severely stall computational threads. Memory                                                     hierarchies, memory staging techniques, and the available synchronization primitives must be thoroughly                                         understood to provide tremendous performance improvements over conventional programming                                                       techniques on CPUs. This course is designed to provide instruction in the design and implementation of GPU-based solutions                                           to computationally intensive problems from a variety of disciplines. NVIDIA’s CUDA and OpenCL will both                                         be used as the programming language, and inter-operate with the open standard graphics language,                                               OpenGL, for massive data visualization. PublicationsPublications2018 ​ R Diao, Z Huang, Y Makarov, Y Chen, B Palmer, S Jin, J Wong, An HPC Based Realtime Path Rating Calculation Tool for Congestion Management with High Penetration of Renewable Energy, CSEE Journal of Power and Energy System, 3(4). ​ 2017 ​ R Huang, S Jin, Y Chen, R Diao, B Palmer, Q Huang, and Z Huang, Faster Than Real-time Dynamic Simulation for Large-Size Power system with Detailed Dynamic Models Using High-Performance Computing Platform, Power & Energy Society General Meeting, 2017 IEEE, 1-5.
