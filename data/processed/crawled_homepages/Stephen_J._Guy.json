Research Vision Our lab develops artificial intelligence and computer vision technologies to advance autonomous robotics and the computational analysis of human movement and behavior. We empower AI systems to understand, anticipate, and interact with real-world human movements and behaviors, and apply these capabilities to enhance human-robot interaction, improve predictive behavior analysis, and create more realistic virtual character animations. Driven by applications in medicine, social robotics, and human-centric AI, our research aims to create innovative, intelligent systems that integrate seamlessly into everyday human environments.

Guy is an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. His research focuses on the development of artificial intelligence and computer vision for use in autonomous robotics and analysis of human movement and behavior. His work has had broad impact on social robotics, games/VR, and medicine. He is the recipient of several awards including the Charles E. Bowers Faculty Teaching Award and multiple best paper awards for his research work in simulation and planning. Stephen's academic work has appeared in top venues for robotics, AI and computer graphics including SIGGRAPH, IJRR, IEEE Trans. on Robotics, AAMAS, AAAI, and IJCAI. His work in human motion analysis has also been widely covered in popular media including newspapers, magazines, documentaries, and late-night TV. 2-Page BioSketch (PDF) Prospective Students (Fall 2025) I currently have no funded positions open If you are interested in working with me as a graduate student, e-mail is the best way to contact me (and most other professors); David Evans has some great advice on how to do this productively -- I strongly recommend reading this before contacting any professor about graduate school. Any students considering applying for a Ph.D. should read the amazing and frank advice from Dr. Mor Harchol-Balter.",
