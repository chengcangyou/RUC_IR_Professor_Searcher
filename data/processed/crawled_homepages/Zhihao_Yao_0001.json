My group (Redoubt Lab) builds practical solutions to real-world challenges in mobile and cloud computing. Our research spans the areas of operating systems, mobile computing, security and privacy. Specifically, we study the security and privacy implications of emerging technologies such as mobile apps, I/O devices, Artificial Intelligence, and Internet of Things. We build systems to address these challenges, and evaluate them in real-world settings. news Aug 14, 2025 Featured in IEEE Computer Society Tech News Aug 2, 2025 Catamaran is accepted to IEEE SecDevâ25.
