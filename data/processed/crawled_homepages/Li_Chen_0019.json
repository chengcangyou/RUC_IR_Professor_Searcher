Oliver, Room 233 301 E. Lewis St, Lafayette, LA 70504 Email Me   Google Scholar Prospective students (PhD and/or undergrad): If you are looking for assistantships, please highlight your strengths, describe why you want to join us, and how you could and/or plan to contribute to our research. Be brief and sincere. (The Cajun vibe) About Me I received my Ph.D. and M.A.Sc. degrees from University of Toronto in 2018 and 2015, respectively, and my Bachelor degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2012. I visited the Hong Kong Polytechnic University from September 2013 to May 2014. My research interests include deep learning systems, federated learning, cloud computing, networking, resource optimization and fairness. Research Lab I am directing the research lab, named CELESTIAL: Communication Efficient LEarning Systems – The Implementation and Algorithms Lab. As the name suggests, we are interested in exploring important problems in distributed systems and networking to better facilitate machine learning and drive artificial intelligence, from both the theoretical and practical perspectives.
