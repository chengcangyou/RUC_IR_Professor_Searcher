Metin Aktulga Assistant Professor Department of Computer Science and Engineering Michigan State University My research interests are in the areas of high performance computing, applications of parallel computing, big data analytics and numerical linear algebra. I primarily work on the design and development of parallel algorithms, numerical methods and software systems that can harness the full potential of state-of-the-art computing platforms to address challenging problems in large scale scientific computations and big-data analytics problems. A distinguishing aspect of my research is the close collaborations that I have built with domain experts in a wide range of fields such as molecular modeling and simulation, computational materials science, nuclear physics. For more detailed information, please see my research page. My short bio I am native of Turkey, originally from Kayseri, born and raised on the beautiful southwest coast of Turkey. I received my B.S. degree from Bilkent University in 2004, M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Purdue University in 2009 and 2010, respectively; all in Computer Science. Before joining MSU in August 2014, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Scientific Computing Group at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). Computer Science and Engineering 428 S.
