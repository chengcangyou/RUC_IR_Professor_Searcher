Through applied research on machine learning and data analytics, we seek to overcome critical operational challenges in industry to support cost-effective large-scale multimedia and mobile services. In contrast to theoretical or fundamental research, my team has been collaborating closly with companies to bridge the \"last mile\" divide between laboratory and marketplace. We apply rigorous algorithmic, computational and optimization techniques to relentlessly close theory-practice gaps so that our systems can operate under the most general realistic environment. Beyond proof-of-concept prototypes or demonstrations, and through technology transfer and entrepreneurship, our systems can be readily and fully integrated into industrial systems with unmatched performance. I keep a strong team of researchers (postdocs, PhD and MPhil candidates) and engineering staff, whose work closely knit together so that our research drives engineering systems while deployment challenges drive our research agenda. Our work has been extensively supported by leading companies such as Boeing, China Mobile, Cisco, Google, HP, Huawei, Mei Ah Entertainment, Microsoft, New World Development, Sun Hung Kei Properties, TCL, Tencent, UMP, etc. Widely known for their practical impacts and deployment success in industry, my systems have won many awards. The following lists some of my system projects which have been under commercial trials or transferred to industry with users (mostly supported by industry-government collaboration program through Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF) and LSCM Center): AI + Healthcare (HealthTech/MedTech/Medical AI) System depoyment Building a Smart IoT City to Efficiently Search for Missing MIP (Mentally Incapacitated People) MIP search with AIoT and LoRa (or NB-IoT) infrastructure (Total HK$9,438,075) Fostering a caring community for dementia anti-wandering (Total HK$13,030,000) Precision Medicine: Developing a Personalized AI Nurse (with UMP Healthcare Innovation and Incubation Company Limited) Deep Learning Technology for Dyslexia Pre-screening (Total HK$3,741,641) IoT Geofencing to Enforce Hong Kong Home Quarantine Order for Covid-19 J.
