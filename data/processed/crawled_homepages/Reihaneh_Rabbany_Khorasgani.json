Complex data is often interconnected, evolving, and hard to label. With my group, at Complex Data Lab, we work on designing methods for analyzing such data; building on techniques for graph mining, graph representation learning, unsupervised and self-supervised learning, anomaly detection, learning with weak and/or uncertain labels, and active and human-in-the-loop learning. Our research projects often involve working with real-world data from online societies, where we design methods closely with domain experts within an interdisciplinary team.
