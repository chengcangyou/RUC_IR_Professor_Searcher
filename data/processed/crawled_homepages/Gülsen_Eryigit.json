I'm the coordinator of ITU NLP Team and an associate professor at the Department of AI & Data Engineering of Computer and Informatics Faculty of Istanbul Technical University. Within this web page, you may find some information about my research areas, my publications, the courses that I teach, some pages in order to guide my current and future students, and some personal material. For further information, please don't hesitate to send me an email from gulsen.cebiroglu [at] itu [dot] edu [dot] tr . Thank you for visiting. Research Areas My main research area is Natural Language Processing and the application of Machine Learning techniques into this area. I'm the national representative of CLARIN (an EU FP7 infrastructure project) in Turkey. I'm a member of ACL(Association of Computational Linguistics) and its special interest groups on natural language learning(SIGNLL). I'm also a founding member of the ITU Natural Language Processing Research Group. Short Bio GÃ¼lÅen EryiÄit is a Professor at Istanbul Technical University (ITU), Turkey, founder of the ITU Turkish NLP Pipeline (tools.nlp.itu.edu.tr) servicing more than 150 researchers, founding member of the ITU Natural Language Processing Group, member of the ITU Learning from Big Data Group. She received her M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Computer Engineering Department, Istanbul Technical University, Turkey, in 2002 and 2007, respectively. In 2006, she worked as a visiting student researcher at VÃ¤xjÃ¶ University, Sweden where she worked in the first ranked team of Conll shared tasks in 2006 and 2007 on multi-lingual dependency parsing. In 2007, she won Siemens Excellence award for her PhD thesis. Â Her current research focuses on natural language processing of Turkish. In this field, she acted as a reviewer or co-author of various publications in prestigious journals and conferences. She was the Turkeyâs representative in CLARIN (EU 7th Framework Programme, CLARIN - Common language resources and technology infrastructure). Recently, she conducted two research projects: one EU Cost Action project âParsing Web2.0 Sentencesâ funded by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) and one national project âTurkish Mobile Personal Assistantâ funded by Turkeyâs Ministry of Science, Industry and Technology. She was the NLP coordinator of one interdisciplinary research project âA Signing Avatar System for Turkish to Turkish Sign Language Machine Translationâ funded by TUBITAK. She is serving as a consultant or technical advisor to several companies. She has been a reviewer for many research and industrial proposals for European Commission (H2020 and Cost Action Programs), TUBITAK, Turkeyâs Ministry of Science, Industry and Technology and Swiss National Science Foundation.
