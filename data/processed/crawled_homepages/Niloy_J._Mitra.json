Mitra Professor of Geometry Processing Virtual Env. and Computer Graphics Dept. of Computer Science University College London (UCL) Address: Dept. of Computer Science, Room 406, 169 Euston Road, Room 406, London NW1 2AE, United Kingdom. email: n.mitra(AT)cs.ucl.ac.uk Curriculum Vitae (pdf) Research My current research focus includes shape analysis, data-driven geometry processing, and computational fabrication. I am especially interested in developing structure-aware representations and abstractions involving 3D geometric data to help reason from raw image, video, or scanned data.

Biography Niloy Mitra is a Professor of Geometry Processing in the Department of Computer Science, University College London (UCL). He received his MS and PhD in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University under the guidance of Leonidas Guibas and Marc Levoy, and was a postdoctoral scholar with Helmut Pottmann at Technical University Vienna. His research interests include shape analysis, computational design and fabrication, and geometry processing. For details, please visit the SmartGeometryProcessing page. Niloy received the 2013 ACM Siggraph Significant New Researcher Award for \"his outstanding work in discovery and use of structure and function in 3D objects\" (UCL press release), the BCS Roger Needham award (BCS press release) in 2015, and the Eurographics Outstanding Technical Contributions Award in 2019. He received the ERC Starting Grant on SmartGeometry in 2013. His work has twice been featured as research highlights in the Communications of the ACM, twice been selected by ACM Siggraph/Siggraph Asia (both in 2017) for press release as research highlight. Niloy was elected as an Eurographics Fellow in 2021. Besides research, Niloy is an active DIYer and loves reading, bouldering, and cooking.
