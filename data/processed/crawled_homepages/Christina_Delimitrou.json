I am an assistant professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Cornell where I lead the SAIL group; I am also a member of the Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL), and the John and Norma Balen Sesquicentennial Faculty Fellow. My main interests are in computer architecture and computer systems. Specifically, I work on improving the resource efficiency of large-scale datacenters through QoS-aware scheduling and resource management techniques. I am also interested in designing efficient server architectures, distributed performance debugging, and cloud security. Before joining Cornell, I earned a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, where I worked with Christos Kozyrakis. I had previously earned an M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford (2011) and a Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens (2009). I have been fortunate to receive a Sloan Faculty Research Award, two Google Faculty Research Awards (2019 and 2020), a Microsoft Research Faculty Fellowship, the 2020 IEEE TCCA Young Computer Architect Award, an Intel Rising Star Award, a Google Research Award in Recognition of Technical Leadership and Achievements in Systems Research, a Facebook Faculty Research Award, the Cornell Excellence in Research Award, and the Cornell Excellence in Teaching Award. My work has also received five IEEE Micro TopPicks Awards, one TopPicks Honorable Mention, and several best paper awards. You can find more information in my CV. I am looking for motivated PhD, MS, and undergrad students to join my group! If you are a Cornell student excited about cloud computing, datacenters, and computer architecture and systems in general send me an email with your CV and we can set up a meeting.
