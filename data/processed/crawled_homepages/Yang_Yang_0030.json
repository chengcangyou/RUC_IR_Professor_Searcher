I am interested in developing machine learning-based algorithms and software for biological data analysis and biomedical information processing. Research Interests Biomedical Image Understanding We design machine learning algorithms for the annotation, clustering, and segmentation of biomedical images, including spatial gene expression images, cryo-EM single-particle images, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence microscopic images, etc. Biological Language Modeling We regard biological sequences (DNA/RNA sequences and amino acid sequences) as a special kind of language, and explore biomolecular structure and functions based on sequence analysis using statistical language models, word embeddings, and deep learning models. Machine Learning and Data Mining We develop algorithms to deal with large scale, imbalanced, and multi-label classification problems, mainly from the biomedical field.",
