Research Interests Jisu Kim’s research lies at the intersection of statistics, geometry, and topology, with particular emphasis on Topological Data Analysis (TDA). He develops statistical methodologies for analyzing geometric and topological structures in data, particularly through persistent homology. His work bridges the gap between statistical and topological frameworks by designing statistical tools tailored to topological contexts and vice versa. He is engaged in the theoretical foundations of statistical inference on manifolds, including estimation of intrinsic dimensionality and reach. He also explores applications of TDA to machine learning. He also contributes to the open source software, notably co-authoring the R package TDA for statistical topological data analysis.
