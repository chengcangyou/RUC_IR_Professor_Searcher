Currently, I am affiliated with the Visual Computing and Learning Lab, collaborating with Prof. Baoquan Chen, Prof. Libin Liu, and Dr. Bin Wang. From 2020 to 2022, I held the position of Lise Meitner Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Max Planck Institute for Informatics, where I was supervised by Prof. Christian Theobalt and Dr. Rhaleb Zayer. During this time, I worked within groups D6 (Visual Computing and Artificial Intelligence) and D4 (Computer Graphics). Prior to that, I pursued my Ph.D. under the guidance of Prof. Nils Thuerey in the group at the Technical University of Munich from 2014 to 2020. I completed my M.Eng. degree at Zhejiang University, China, in March 2014. Research Interest I'm interested in Physics-Enhanced Deep Learning. Combining deep-learning-based algorithms and physical simulations, the research aims to improve the flexibility of simulations and to enhance the accuracy and generalizability of deep learning models.
