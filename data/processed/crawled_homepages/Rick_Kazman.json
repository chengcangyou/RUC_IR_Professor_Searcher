I care not only about the technical aspects of design but also the economic, social, and environmental implications of design decisions. My methods and tools have been adopted by Fortune 500 companies world-wide. According to Google Scholar my research has been cited over 30,000 times. In my spare time I like to do gardening, practice taekwondo, ride my bike, play piano, and sing. Research InterestsMy research centers on the following topics, and their interaction of course:Software Architecture Design and AnalysisArchitecture/Design Analysis Tools and MethodsTechnical Debt/Architecture DebtSocio-Technical CongruenceIT Economics ​ Selected PublicationsBooksH.
