Bowers College of Computing and Information Science, the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute, and the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. Azenkot is broadly interested in human-computer interaction (HCI) and accessibility. Her research focuses on enabling people with disabilities to have equal access to information through mobile and wearable devices. Specifically, she is interested in how current and emerging technologies (e.g., smart glasses, 3D printers) can address significant accessibility challenges for people who are blind or have low vision in the domains of orientation and mobility, education, and employment. Azenkot frequently publishes at top HCI and accessibility conferences, including CHI, ASSETS, UIST, and UbiComp. She received a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Washington in 2014, where she was awarded the Graduate School Medal, an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, and an AT&T Labs Graduate Fellowship. She also holds a B.A. in Computer Science from Pomona College. < Back to People SHARE THIS ON: GET IN TOUCH: Website @shiriazenkot XR Access JACOBS TECHNION-CORNELL INSTITUTE About the Jacobs Institute",
