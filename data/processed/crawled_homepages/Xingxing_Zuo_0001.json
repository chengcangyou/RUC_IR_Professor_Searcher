His long-term research vision is to enable natural interaction and seamless collaboration between robots and humans in open environments by accurately understanding robot states, surrounding 3D scenes, and action execution. Email Share Prior to joining MBZUAI, Professor Zuo was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences at Caltech (USA). In 2024, he worked at Google AR (USA) as a Visiting Faculty Researcher. From 2021 to 2023, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the Technical University of Munich (Germany), and from 2019 to 2021, he was an academic guest at ETH Zurich (Switzerland). Professor Zuo currently serves as an Associate Editor for the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), as well as for the flagship robotics conferences ICRA (2023–2025) and IROS (2022–2025). His research interests span robotics, 3D computer vision, state estimation, and embodied AI. He has published over 40 peer-reviewed publications, with most appearing in top-tier robotics and AI venues, including IEEE T-RO, JFR, IEEE T-ASE, IJCV, ICRA, IROS, and CVPR.
