My research centers around term rewriting. In particular, in the last few years my focus has been on the application of term rewriting to other areas of computer science, such as computational complexity and software verification. More details on this are available in the pages on my research; or jump immediately to my publications. I also teach about research topics in this area as one of the lecturers in the Master course automated reasoning. Aside from this, my primary teaching responsibilities are in a rather different area, as I am responsible for the courses of Software Engineering, System Development Management and Software Development Entrepreneurship in the GiPHouse company. This is a small company within the university that is run entirely by students. More information can be found on the teaching page. For students interested in doing a bachelor or master project with me: please see the page on supervision. For students interested in term rewriting in general: you may be interested in joining the International School on Rewriting which will be held in Obergurgl in the summer of 2024 (and where I will be one of the lecturers in the advanced track).
