Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab at UC Berkeley, and before that a researcher at IBM Research Zurich. I completed my PhD in 2014 at ETH Zurich and was a visiting PhD student at Stanfords University’s Statistics Department. My work is centered on machine learning, artificial intelligence, and information processing. I focus on developing algorithms and foundations for deep learning, particularly for medical imaging, on establishing mathematical and empirical underpinnings for machine learning, and on the utilization of DNA as a digital information technology.
