Email Google Scholar CV 📢 I’m recruiting several PhD students Some questions we’ll explore together: 🔧 How can we guide models to produce outputs that follow constraints? 🔎 How can we make models easier to interpret and explain? 📊 How can we measure and reduce uncertainty in predictions? If this fits you, please email your CV (with publication list, transcripts, and SOP) to hle40@charlotte.edu with the subject line [PhDApplicant-YourName].
