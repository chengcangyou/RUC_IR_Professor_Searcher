Goodwin Ave., Urbana, IL 61801 Phone: +1-847-323-2968 Links: publications, google scholar, extended bio, CV I serve as the Chair of ACM SIGCOMM, and an organizer of The Networking Channel, an online community talk series for the computer systems and networking community. I co-founded and previously served as the Chief Science Officer and President of Veriflow (sold to VMware in 2019). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from UC Berkeley. My research focuses on improving the robustness of computer systems and networks through principles of softwarization and programmability, enabling the use of techniques from the field of software engineering and AI to build highly functional and reliable systems. I like developing novel data structures and algorithms to represent complicated system functions in ways that enable highly scalable formal reasoning about the behaviors of those systems, enabling verification of safety properties, checking of possible future behaviors, and deriving system configurations with desirable safety properties. For an overview of one of my projects please see this video.
