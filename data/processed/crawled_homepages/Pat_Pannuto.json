My research aims to expand the reach of computational infrastructure to sense and actuate more of the physical world. My expertise is in the design and implementation of resource constrained computing systems. These are systems whose deployment in the world constrains their form factor, connectivity, deployability, and maintainability, which often must then operate on microwatts of power, with only kilobytes of memory and effectively kilobit/second lossy communication links – yet the systems as a whole must be accurate, timely, and reliable. I am always excited to learn about new and interesting problems that we may be able to solve. In the past, this has included efforts to embed computation in more places with the world's smallest computer, to build systems for human social interaction tracking to support epidemiologists and psychologists, to design infrastructure to support city-scale sensing, and to develop technology capable of country-wide grid health monitoring.

The monitoring and maintenance of corrosion protection (or the consequences of its unchecked failure) is often one of the leading costs of infrastructure upkeep. Galvanic cathodic protection is a common corrosion control technique that is employed in applications from home appliances to boats to bridges. At its core, galvanic cathodic protection is simply an electrochemical cell—that is, a battery. This presents an opportunity to treat corrosion protection as an in-situ power source that by definition will last as long as the protection system itself. We show how to use infrastructure as a power source for wireless sensing devices. Our system takes advantage of newly available LPWAN technologies that allow for effortless wide-area coverage. We demonstrate the viability and efficacy of the system on one of the most common galvanic cathodic protection systems, home hot water heaters. We show that this technique can be a powerful new asset for corrosion monitoring and for deploying wireless sensor networks broadly. While many cathodic protection systems are physically inaccessible (e.g. buried underground), deployments include frequent test points to enable inspection and maintenance. Today, these test points receive only infrequent, costly, manual sampling. Social Interaction Tracking { Behavior Research Methods'21 | MobiCom'20 } Infrastructure { IMC'21 } The Tock Operating System { SOSP'17 | APSys'17 | PLOS'15 } Low-power microcontrollers lack some of the hardware features and memory resources that traditionally enable multiprogrammable systems. Accordingly, microcontroller-based operating systems have not provided important features like fault isolation, dynamic memory allocation, and flexible concurrency. However, an emerging class of embedded applications are software platforms, rather than single purpose devices, and need these multiprogramming features. Tock, a new operating system for low-power platforms, takes advantage of limited hardware-pr",
