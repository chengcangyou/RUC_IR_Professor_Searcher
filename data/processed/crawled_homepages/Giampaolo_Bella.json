A few signs of my Ph.D. remain, four years of privileged reading, illuminated by Professor Larry Paulson's supervision among the beautiful surroundings of Clare College. My first year assessment was criticised and oriented by Roger Needham, while Mike Gordon and Peter Ryan were my final Viva examiners, those who decided to enter my thesis (still available) in the distinguished dissertations scheme. At Cambridge, I had fun working as a Computer Officer at Newnhanm College and establishing the Cambridge University Italian Society, of which I was President for two years. Right after my Ph.D, I was a postdoc at Technische Universität München, visiting Tobias Nipkow's group, then back at Cambridge for another postdoc, of three years. Later, in 2008, I was a Visiting Research Fellow at SAP Research France with Volkmar Lotz and Luca Compagna. As from 2010, I was a Visiting Researcher at De Montfort University Leicester for five years, then, as from 2019, a Visiting Professor at Royal Holloway University of London for two years. Since 2019, I am Chief Cyber Security Advisor through DMI for ICT Cyber Consulting, proud of tight interactions with Paolo Balboni and Luca Bolognini.",
