  "content": "Anupam Sobti I am interested in applied research that drives sustainable communities by reducing the information gap among various stakeholders, e.g., information about heat islands in the city, or information about crop health to an insurance company. I use techniques from computer vision, machine learning and embedded systems to design these systems. Recent focus in the group has been using techniques in self supervised learning to build scalable and generalizable models that can be applied to areas in urban planning and agriculture. I lead the Geospatial Computer Vision Group at Plaksha University, Mohali, India. Our vision is to develop state of the art geospatial intelligence for supporting domains across urban climate, agriculture, and water security. Have a look at our latest publications to know more. I am on the lookout for industries, startups, and students for collaboration towards these goals. If you think I can help, please get in touch. selected publications What’s Up On The Roof: Tracking Cool Roofs in India with Satellite Imaging Varchita Lalwani, Anupam Sobti, and Vishal Garg ACM Journal on Computing and Sustainable Societies, 2024 PDF Evaluation of computer vision pipeline for farm-level analytics: A case study in Sugarcane Sambal Shikhar, Rajiv Ranjan, Aman Sa, and 5 more authors In ACM SIGCAS/SIGCHI Conference on Computing and Sustainable Societies (COMPASS) , 2024 HTML PDF Label-free Anomaly Detection in Aerial Agricultural Images with Masked Image Modeling Sambal Shikhar, and Anupam Sobti IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop on Agriculture Vision, 2024 HTML PDF I prefer email for contacting me.",
