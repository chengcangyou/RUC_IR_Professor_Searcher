Prior to joining NTU, I worked with Noah Smith and Hanna Hajishirzi as a Postdoc in Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington. I completed my PhD under the supervision of Sinno Jialin Pan at Nanyang Technological University. My main research interest lies in Natural Language Processing with extension to Multimodal Learning, particularly investigating and utilising the mystery of generative models in the following dimensions: Model Reasoning: Studying and enhancing the structured reasoning capability of generative models, including but not limited to symbolic reasoning, logic reasoning and causal reasoning, with the aim to build more robust models to solve complex tasks beyond semantic understanding. Explainability and Trustworthiness: Developing effective models for misinformation/hallucination detection and mitigation. Enhancing models' explainability. Efficient Learning: Developing small-scale models and optimizing long contexts. I am now actively looking for motivated PhD Students and Research Assistants with an interest in natural language processing or multimodal reasoning.
