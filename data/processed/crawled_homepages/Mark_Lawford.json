I am also a founding member and current Director of the McMaster Centre for Software Certification (McSCert). I joined the department in August 1998 as an Assistant Professor. My PhD was completed under the supervision of Prof. W.M. Wonham in the Systems Control group at the University of Toronto in February 1997. From March 1997 to July 1998 I was a contractor at Ontario Hydro performing Formal Verification of the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station Shutdown System Trip Computer Software. For the small part I played in helping to automate the systematic design verification of safety critical software on that project, I was a co-recipient of an Ontario Hydro New Technology award. My research interests fall under the general headings of Software Engineering and Control of Discrete Event Systems (DES), in particular Software Certification, Formal Methods for Real-Time Systems (synthesis, verification, and model reduction), practical application of formal methods in the software engineering process, computer aided inspection, and supervisory control of modular, nondeterministic and probabilistic DES, and hybrid systems. I am a licensed Professional Engineer in the province of Ontario and a Senior Member of the IEEE. Academic Activities: Publications: A bibliography of selected papers with abstracts , BibTeX entries and full papers downloads of some of my work. Research Collaborations: I currently have a number of ongoing research collaborations: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) through research contracts and an NSERC CRD led by Ali Emadi and in the past funded by the APC funded LEAP project General Motors through an NSERC CRD and in the past through the APC and ORF-RE funded NECSIS project Some past research collaborations of note have been: Toyota InfoTechnology Center donation for Automotive Software Certification Ontario Power Generation, Systemware International, and others through the ORF-RE funded Certification of Safety-Critical Software-Intensive Systems project Tools for Matlab/Simulink: Tabular Expression Toolbox was originally developed by my former Software Engineering M.A.Sc. student Colin Eles. More information on the tool is available here Auto Layout Tool. Automatically clean up model layout in manual or auto generated simulink models. Developed by Bennett MacKenzie, Steven Postma and Jeff Ong Data Store Pushdown (scoping) - Automatically scope (and rescope) Data Stores to help meet proposed MAAB guidelines and improve model structure and modularity. Developed by Bennett MacKenzie, Steven Postma and Jeff Ong Reach/Coreach Tool - Trace data dependencies forward (reach) and backwards (coreach) and slice models taking into account implicit data and control flow. Developed by Bennett MacKenzie, Steven Postma and Jeff Ong Signature Tool - Detect and document implicit data flow involving data stores and goto/from blocks. Automatically generate documentation of inputs/outputs and updates. Developed by Bennett MacKenzie, Steven Postma, Gordon Marks and Jeff Ong Software Certification Consortium (SCC): I have been working with my McSCert colleagues (Alan Wassyng and Tom Maibaum) and many others, to establish a Software Certification Consortium (SCC). One of SCC's first initiatives is to issue a Software Grand Challenge to use formal methods to specify, design and implement a Pacemaker. The starting point is an informal requirements document from Boston Scientific and a PIC Microcontroller based hardware reference platform developed at the University of Minnesota. I am currently in the process of getting Pacemaker boards manufactured. Please contact me if you are interested in purchasing one.
