[12/10/2014] I was a recipient of the CUNY Certificate of Recognition for the year 2014. [03/11/2015] GeoTECI Ph.D. Student Simin You has released his SpatialSpark source code at GitHub [Link]. The related CloudDM'15 paper can be found here. [04/02/2015] A summary of our work on GPU-based geospatial processing over the past five years (2009-2014) entitled \"Large-Scale Spatial Data Processing on GPUs and GPU-Accelerated Clusters\" appeared at the ACM SIGSPATIAL Special as an invited paper. Click here for a local copy. [07/03/2015] We have released the source code of our ISP prototypes (including ISP-MC, ISP-MC+ and ISP-GPU). Click here for the code and here for the HardBD'15 paper as a high level documentation. It has been a very tough yet pleasant journey to learn advanced features of Impala and integrate our single node data parallel spatial indexing and spatial join techniques (on GPUs as well as multi-core CPUs) into Cloudera  Impala. The learnt experiences and lessons lead us to the design and implementation of LDE as a succession to ISP. [12/29/2015] GeoTECI Ph.D. Student Simin You has successfully defended his dissertation on 11/30/2015 and completed all the procedures for graduation recently. The PDF file of Dr. You's dissertation, entitled \"Large-scale spatial data management on modern parallel and distributed platforms\", can be downloaded here (139 pages). Congratulations! [05/2019] Haidar Alanbari completed his Master Thesis entitled \"Integrating Multi-Source Weather Data for Deep Learning\". Congratulations! [12/2019] Yamile Patino Vargas completed her Master Thesis entitled \"Towards Improving Accuracy and Interpretability of Deep Learning based on Satellite Image Classification\". Congratulations! [03/28/2020] As part of my work at Nvidia as a Visiting Professor, I have added quadtree-based indexing on large-scale point data and point-in-polygon-test based spatial join modules to cuSpatial. The open source code is at my GitHub page here. The code will be merged to official cuSpatial release after code review. I encourage visiting the NYC taxi trip experiment code [cpp/tests/join/spatial_join_nyctaxi_test.cu] to see 10^4 speedup over GDAL implementation on CPUs.
