Abu-Mostafa Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science A sample from Professor Abu-Mostafa's Machine Learning lectures What's New: The US patent for the blood clot detection method has been issued in February 2025. Our non-invasive method for measuring true Blood Pressure was featured in the IEEE Spectrum, in several news articles, and in a Caltech article. The peer-reviewed paper appears in PNAS Nexus and US patent # 11,950,887 for the method has been issued. Popular Items: The most watched Watson Lecture of the centennial season is Professor Abu-Mostafa's public talk on \"Artificial Intelligence: The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly\". The textbook Learning from Data is one of Amazon's bestsellers in Machine Learning, and was Amazon's #1 in all categories of Computer Science repeatedly. The online course (MOOC) on Machine Learning has attracted more than 8 million views on YouTube and other servers since its launch as Caltech's first-ever live broadcast of a course.
