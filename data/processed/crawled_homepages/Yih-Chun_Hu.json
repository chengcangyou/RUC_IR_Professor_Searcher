May 2003. Advisor: David B. Johnson. Dissertation: Enabling Secure High-Performance Wireless Ad Hoc Networking. Research StatementMy general research interests are in security and systems, with emphasis on the areas of secure systems and mobile communications. I have published papers in the areas of secure Internet routing, secure routing in wireless ad hoc networks, security and anonymity in peer-to-peer networks, efficient cryptographic mechanisms for routing security, and design and evaluation of ad hoc network routing protocols. In my future research, I will continue to build new systems with lightweight and minimally intrusive security. I will build systems that preserve privacy and anonymity in wireless networks to overcome attackers that can correlate individual wireless transmissions. In environments where user cooperation can be a public good, I will design techniques that incentivize user cooperation while minimizing the impact of malicious players. I will design and use evaluation frameworks that objectively, quantifiably, and rigorously measure the performance of secure systems under attack. I will also build backwards-compatible, incrementally-deployable lightweight security mechanisms for widely-deployed protocols with insufficient security.
