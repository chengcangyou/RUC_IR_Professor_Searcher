My research interests lie at the intersection of human-computer interaction(HCI), social computing, computational social science, and machine learning, especially in studying, designing, and building systems that support social interactions, to enhance trust, engagement, creativity, and knowledge sharing in virtual and physical spaces. I am currently exploring how to leverage emerging media (e.g., livestreaming and Mixed Reality) and generative AI models for sharing knowledge, enhancing creativity, and safeguarding Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH). I am currently serving as the Chair of the Asia SIGCHI Committee (ASC), which aims to activate HCI research and practices in Asia. Prior to joining GMU, I was an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong. I finished my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Toronto under the supervision of Professor Daniel Wigdor. Previously I was a Master of Interdisciplinary Studies of Information and Art Design at Tsinghua University, China, supervised by Professor Ying-Qing Xu and Professor Yuanchun Shi. Before starting my master, I had a bachelor of Electronic Engineering and Game Design at Tsinghua University. For more information, see my CV. I am looking for talented and highly motivated PhD students and RAs/interns who are interested in social computing and computational social science to join my group at George Mason University, starting in 2025. If you are interested in working with me, please send me an email with your CV. If you are already enrolled in the GMU-CS program (undergrad or MS) and want to do research in my lab, please feel free to reach out. Why GMU CS? As of November 2024, GMU is ranked 33 in CSRankings. GMU CS is fastly growing in the number of faculty members and is increasingly active in top-tier CS conferences. news Feb 14, 2025 Five papers accepted to ACM CSCW 2025.
