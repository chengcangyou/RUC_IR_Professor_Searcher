I calculated my Erdös number to be 3 as follows: Noga Alon, Paul Erdös. Disjoint edges in geometric graphs. Discrete & Computational Geometry, 4(1):287-290, 1989. Noga Alon, Shmuel Friedland, and Gil Kalai. Regular subgraphs of almost regular graphs. Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B 37, pages 79-91, 1984. Shmuel Friedland, Volker Mehrmann, Renato Pajarola and Susanne K. Suter. On best rank one approximation of tensors. Numerical Linear Algebra with Applications, to appear, 2013.
