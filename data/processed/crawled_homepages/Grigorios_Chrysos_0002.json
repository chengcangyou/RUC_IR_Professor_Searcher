My research focuses on trustworthy machine learning. I am particularly passionate about developing innovative algorithms and techniques that can understand and interpret data in complex real-world scenarios. I am recruiting motivated PhD students from the ECE or CS program. If you have already been admitted to UW-Madison ECE/CS PhD program and are interested in my research, I encourage you to reach out. If you are in Madison and are interested to learn more on trustworthy machine learning, I am teaching ECE/Stat/Math 888 next semester - we will have a significant component dedicated to trustworthy machine learning, so feel free to check it out. Research Interests Machine Learning Deep learning architectures, theoretical foundations of machine learning with applications to real-world problems. Trustworthy Machine Learning Robustness to malicious attacks, reasoning under uncertainty, privacy, algorithms that can adapt to changing environments. Parsimonious Learning Novel architectures, training methodologies, and efficient learning paradigms. Research Highlights Multilinear Mixture of Experts: Scalable Expert Specialization through Factorization Can we scale the number of experts to thousands? Paper Code Project NeurIPS 2024 Revisiting character-level adversarial attacks for Language Models How effective are simple character-level attacks in modern language models? Paper Code ICML 2024 Going beyond compositional generalization, DDPMs can produce zero-shot interpolation Can diffusion models synthesize content they have never seen during training?
