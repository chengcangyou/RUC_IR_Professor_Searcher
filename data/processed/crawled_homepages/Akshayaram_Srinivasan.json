I am a member of the Theory Group. Before joining U of T, I was at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai. Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of California, Berkeley, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Sanjam Garg. Before that, I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. Research My research focuses on the foundational aspects of cryptography, with a particular focus on the following topics. Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) Exploring protocols that allow multiple parties to jointly compute a function over their private inputs without revealing anything except the output. Zero-Knowledge Proofs Investigating methods where one party can prove to another that a statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the veracity of the statement itself. Post-Quantum Cryptography Developing cryptographic systems that are resistant to attacks by quantum computers.
