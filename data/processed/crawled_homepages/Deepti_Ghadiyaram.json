I am also an Affiliated Faculty with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Faculty of Computing & Data Sciences and an academic collaborator with Runway. My research interests are in building safe, interpretable, and robust computer vision systems and also on improving their reasoning capabilities. I obtained my PhD at the University of Texas at Austin and worked at Facebook AI Applied Research and Runway prior to joining BU. Note to prospective students: If you are currently a MS student at BU and are interested in working with me, please first take either CS599 (Advanced Topics in Computer Vision) or CS542 (Principles of Machine Learning) , or CS541 (Applied achine Learning) . I do not recruit students who haven’t first taken one of these courses. Please do not email me before taking these courses. If you are interested in applying to BU as a PhD student and are interested in working with me, mention my name in your application. It is not necessary to contact me and attach your application. Due to large volumes, I am unable to respond to your emails. News Received the NAIRR Deep Partnership program award! Gave two talks at ICCV’25, one on interpretability of generative models at Explainable Computer Vision: Quo Vadis? , another on the techniques to improve fine-grained prompt alignment of generations at Computer Vision in Advertising and Marketing Received Moorman-Simon Interdisciplinary Career Development Professorship award from Boston University for the years 2025-2028 for conducting interdisciplinary work! Serving as a senior Area Chair for CVPR’26! Two papers [REVELIO 🪄] and [GUIDE] accepted at ICCV’25!🎉 I served as one of the chairs for the Broadening Participation at CVPR’25. Our goal was to identify students who don’t have the financial means to attend and support them. I’ll be speaking at Scalable Generative Models in Computer Vision and WorldModelBench: The 1st Workshop on Benchmarking World Models at CVPR’25 Named Computing & Data Sciences (CDS) Faculty Fellow in 2024.

Her research interests are in Computer Vision and Machine Learning, with a special focus improving the safety, interpretability, and robustness of machine learning systems. Previously she spent over an year as a researcher at Runway and over 5 years at Meta AI Research working on image and video understanding models, fair and inclusive computer vision models, and ML explainability. She obtained her PhD at the University of Texas at Austin in 2017 on perceptual image and video quality assessment for real-world content. She has served as a program chair for NeurIPS 2022 Dataset and Benchmarks track, AIMLsystems’23, and an area chair for several conferences such as IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), Women in Machine Learning (WiML), and Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI). She organized several workshops on the topics of responsible and explainable computer vision at top-tier machine learning conferences.",
