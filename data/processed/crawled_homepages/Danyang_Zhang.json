The problem is how to design a program that can partition a digital image in such a way that different objects in the image can be distinguished for more meaningful and intelligent analysis. He has been dedicated to designing connected components labeling (CCL) algorithms for object detection and recognition. He is also interested in CBIR (Content-based Image Retrieval), and designing and developing network protocols for different computernetworks like wired networks and sensor networks to enhance their performance. He likes doing research in graph theory and ubiquitous computing as well.
