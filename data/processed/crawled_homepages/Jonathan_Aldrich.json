Scott was released in January 2025! Michael and I maintain a website where you can download the companion, find errata, etc. Research I work at the intersection of programming languages and software engineering. My research explores how the way we express software affects our ability to engineer software at scale. A particular theme of much of my work is improving software quality and programmer productivity through better ways to express structural and behavioral aspects of software design within source code. I have contributed to object-oriented typestate checking, modular and gradual verification techniques for aspects and stateful programs, and new object-oriented language models. For my work specifying and verifying architecture, I received a 2006 NSF CAREER award and the 2007 Dahl-Nygaard Junior Prize (press release, article). News During my Spring 2022 sabbatical, I co-founded Noteful, a company whose mission is teaching the world to read music. Our app is available on the web, iOS, and Android platforms! New Students Wanted! I have information for prospective Ph.D. students and advice for current students. Active Projects Borrow Sanitizer - a dynamic analysis tool for detecting Rust-specific aliasing bugs in multi-language applications. Gradual Verification - Analogous to gradual typing, allows programmers to effectively verify partially specified code, checking statically where possible and at run time where neceesary. TTPython - a Python-based DSL making it easier to write time-sensitive IoT applications From Sketches to Code for Data Scientists Liquid Java - Usable Liquid Types for Java SASyLF - An educational proof assistant for language and logic metatheory Past Projects Penrose - A language for visualizing mathematical objects (still active but led by others now). Wyvern - A general-purpose language focused on security, modularity, and language extensibility. Obsidian - A domain-specific language for writing safer smart contracts on blockchain and other platforms. Plaid - A typestate-oriented, gradually typed programming language AEminium - A concurrent-by-default programming language, implemented as an extension to Plaid Object-Oriented Foundations - New models for object-oriented languages Typestate - Verifying component and library usage constraints (Plural tool) Separation Logic - Modular verification of higher-order, typed programs Ownership and Architecture - Capturing the high-level structure of object graphs ArchJava Enforcing run-time software architecture within object-oriented code Crystal - A Eclipse-based framework for teaching dataflow analysis Talks Selected talks and tutorials Publications All papers Curriculum Vitae (html, PDF) Service I'm a member of the ACM Publications Board and I've created an informal FAQ to help people deal with publications issues that may come up. Questions and feedback on how we can do a better job is welcome! ICSE 2019, program committee. OOPSLA 2018, program committee. OOPSLA 2017, program committee chair. SPLASH 2015 was held in Pittsburgh!

Before that, I was a graduate student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, working with Craig Chambers and David Notkin. My wife Becky Billock and I enjoy hiking, backpacking, and mountain climbing, and playing music together. We were married in 2000 and have two awesome kids, Seal and Evelyn.
