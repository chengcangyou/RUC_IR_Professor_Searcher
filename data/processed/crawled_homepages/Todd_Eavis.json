Sign in to edit Research areas: programming languages, code generation, continuous integration and delivery Contact information Email: todd.eavis@concordia.ca BiographyTodd Eavis received his PhD in 2003 from Dalhousie University in Halifax and was an NSERC postdoctoral fellow at Carleton University in Ottawa.  He joined the faculty of Concordia University in 2004, where he is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering. His general research focus is the design of programming languages and software development environments. PublicationsThe eventual distribution target for the current work is the Open Source community, as opposed to imprisonment behind the customary paywall. For the sake of completeness, a random sample of old, completely unrelated publications, is below. Others can be found on DBLP.

Teaching activitiesDr Eavis's teaching includes courses with a focus on programming languages and system architectures. Classes that he has taught include: COMP 228: System Hardware COMP 248: Object Oriented Programming I COMP 249: Object Oriented Programming II COMP 346: Operating Systems COMP 348: Principles of Programming Languages COMP 352: Data Structures and Algorithms COMP 353: Databases COMP 428: Parallel Programming COMP 444: Systems Programming COMP 451: Database Design COMP 6411: Comparative Programming Languages (Graduate level) COMP 6521: Advanced Database Applications (Graduate level) Research activitiesDr. Eavis's current research explores issues related to the design of more approachable software development frameworks. The overarching objective is not only a reduction in the opacity and sheer scale of contemporary language syntax but, perhaps even more importantly, a concomitant reduction in the complexity, fragility, and inflexibility of the build environments meant to support these languages. Ultimately, the aim is to allow the developer to focus more fully on \"what\" an application is expected to do, rather than \"how\" one actually convinces a computer to do it. A few representative themes include: 90/10 syntax (90% of the functionality, with 10% of the obscurity) Extensive code generation (why write what can be inferred) Platform agnostic development (portability without severe performance degradation) Seamless delivery to the Cloud (the desktop is dead - long live the Cloud) Transparent builds (nobody deserves to maintain a build system ) Continuous Integration/Delivery as the default (waterfalls are for fish, not software) Integrated coding, unit testing, and delivery (the natural outcome of the other targets) Are you the profile owner?
