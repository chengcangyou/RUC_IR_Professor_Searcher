Wednesday on zoom, by appointment, 1:00pm-2:00pm. Research Interests I am primarily interested in the problem of computing on encrypted data. To maintain privacy and security, it is increasingly important that our information remain encrpyted not just when at rest, but at all times. We have to balance this need with the desire that our data remain useful. My research looks at how we can achieve both goals. I am interested both in the foundational aspects of this question (what is even possible?), and in how we can make such techniques practical in the real world.

From 2012 until 2015, I was a research scientist at Applied Communication Sciences (ACS), where I did research in cryptography and cyber security. Prior to that, I was a postdoc at Columbia University with Tal Malkin, as a recipient of the Computing Innovation Fellowship. I received my PhD in July 2010 with Jonathan Katz in the computer science department at the University of Maryland. Here's my curriculum vitae (PDF).

Dov Gordon, Daniel Starin, Arkady Yerukhimovich Eurocrypt, 2021. Paper will be available for download soon. Secure multi-party computation (MPC) allows multiple par-ties to perform secure joint computations on their private inputs. To-day, applications for MPC are growing with thousands of parties wish-ing to build federated machine learning models or trusted setups forblockchains. To address such scenarios we propose a novel MPC proto-col that maximizes throughput when run with large numbers of parties.In particular, our protocol has both communication and computationcomplexity that decrease with the number of parties. In particular, weshow that when used as a triple-generating service to produce offlinematerial for general MPC protocols, our construction achieves a totalthroughput of 320 million triples per second when run with approxi-mately 1 million parties. Our protocol builds on prior protocols based onpacked secret-sharing, introducing new approaches to optimally leveragepacked sharing for general (unpacked) computation. Secure parallel computation on national scale volumes of data. Sahar Mazloom, Phi Hung Le, Samuel Ranellucci, S.~Dov gordon Usenix Security, 2020. Download. We revisit the problem of performing secure computation of graph-parallel algorithms, focusing on the applications of securely outsourcing matrix factorization, and histograms. Leveraging recent results in low-communication secure multiparty computation, and a security relaxation that allows the computation servers to learn some differentially private leakage about user inputs, we construct a new protocol that reduces overall runtime by 320X, reduces the number of AES calls by 750X, and reduces the total communication by 200X. Our system can securely compute histograms over 300 million items in about 4 minutes, and it can perform sparse matrix factorization, which is commonly used in recommendation systems, on 20 million records in about 6 minutes.1 Furthermore, in contrast to prior work, our system is secure against a malicious adversary that corrupts one of the computing servers. Stormy: Statistics in Tor by Measuring Securely Ryan Wails, Aaron Johnson, Daniel Starin, Arkady Yerukhimovich, S. Dov Gordon ACM CCS, 2019. Download. Tor is a tool for Internet privacy with millions of daily users. The Tor system benefits in many ways from information gathered about the operation of its network. Measurements guide operators in diagnosing problems, direct the efforts of developers, educate users about the level of privacy they obtain, and inform policymakers about Tor's impact. However, data collection and reporting can degrade user privacy, contradicting Tor's goals. Existing approaches to measuring Tor have limited capabilities and security weaknesses. We present Stormy, a general-purpose, privacy-preserving measurement system that overcomes these limitations. Stormy uses secure multiparty computation (MPC) to compute any function of the observations made by Tor relays, while keeping those observations secret. Stormy makes use of existing efficient MPC protocols that are secure in the malicious model, and in addition it includes a novel input-sharing protocol that is secure, efficient, and fault tolerant. The protocol is non-interactive, which is consistent with how relays currently submit measurements, and it allows the relays to go offline after input submission, even while ensuring that an honest relay will not have its input excluded or modified. The input-sharing protocol is compatible with MPC protocols computing on authenticated values and may be of independent interest. We show how Stormy can be deployed in two realistic models: (1) run primarily by a small set of dedicated authorities, or (2) run decentralized across the relays in the Tor network. Stormy scales efficiently to Tor's thousands of relays, tolerates network churn, and provides security depending only on either Tor's existing trust assumption that at least one authority is honest (in the first model) or the existing assumption that a large fraction of relay bandwidth is honest (in the second model). We demonstrate how to use the system to compute two broadly-applicable statistics: the median of relay inputs and the cardinality of set-union across relays. We implement Stormy and experimentally evaluate system performance. When Stormy is run among authorities we can perform 151 median computations or 533 set-union cardinalities over 7,000 relay inputs in a single day. When run among the relays themselves, Stormy can perform 36 median computations or 134 set union cardinalities per day. Thus, both deployments enable non-trivial analytics to be securely computed in the Tor network. Two-party Private Set Intersection with an Untrusted Third Party Phi Hung Le, Samuel Ranellucci, S. Dov Gordon ACM CCS, 2019. Download. We construct new protocols for two parties to securely compute on the items in their intersection. Our protocols make use of an untrusted third party that has no input. The use of this party allows us to construct highly efficient protocols that are secure against a single malicious corruption. Best of Both Worlds in Secure Computation, with Low Communication Overhead. Daniel Genkin, S. Dov Gordon, Samuel Ranellucci ACNS, 2018 Download. When performing a secure multiparty computation with a few hundred parties, using the best protocols known today, bandwidth constraints are the primary bottleneck. A long line of work demonstrates that n parties can compute a circuit C of depth d while communicating O(|C| log |C| + poly(d, n) field elements per party, as long as a majority of parties are honest. However, in the malicious majority setting, a lot less is known. The work of Nielsen and Ranellucci is the first to provide constant-overhead in the communication complexity when a majority of parties are malicious; their result demonstrates feasibility, but is quite complex and impractical. In this work, we construct a new MPC protocol in the pre-processing model. We introduce a new middle-ground: our protocol has low communication and provides robustness when a majority of parties are honest, and gives security with abort (possibly with higher communication cost) when a majority of players are malicious. Robustness is impossible when a majority of parties are malicious; viewing the increased communication complexity as a form of denial of service, similar to an abort, we view our result as providing the “best of both worlds”. Secure Computation with Low Communication from Cross-Checking. S. Dov Gordon, Samuel Ranellucci, Xiao Wang IACR Asiacrypt, 2018. Download. We construct new four-party protocols for secure computation that are secure against a single malicious corruption. Our protocols can perform computations over a binary ring, and require sending just 1.5 ring elements per party, per gate. In the special case of Boolean circuits, this amounts to sending 1.5 bits per party, per gate. One of our protocols is robust, yet requires almost no additional communication. Our key technique can be viewed as a variant of the “dual execution” approach, but, because we rely on four parties instead of two, we can avoid any leakage, achieving the standard notion of security. Simple and Efficient Two-Server ORAM S. Dov Gordon, Jonathan Katz, Xiao Wang IACR Asiacrypt, 2018 Download. We show a protocol for two-server oblivious RAM (ORAM) that is simpler and more efficient than the best prior work. Our construction combines any tree-based ORAM with an extension of a two-server private information retrieval scheme by Boyle et al., and is able to avoid recursion and thus use only one round of interaction. In addition, our scheme has a very cheap initialization phase, making it well suited for RAM-based secure computation. Although our scheme requires the servers to perform a linear scan over the entire data, the cryptographic computation involved consists only of block-cipher evaluations. A practical instantiation of our protocol has excellent concrete parameters: for storing an N-element array of arbitrary size data blocks with statistical security parameter λ, the servers each store 4N encrypted blocks, the client stores λ+2logN blocks, and the total communication ",
