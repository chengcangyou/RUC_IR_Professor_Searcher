Until recently, I was an SNSF postdoc working with Mike I. Jordan at UC Berkeley, and obtained my PhD at EPFL advised by Martin Jaggi. I also co-lead the Federated Learning for Health working group at MONAI with Holger Roth at NVIDIA. My work has previously been deployed across industry at Meta, Google, Open AI, Owkin. Selected Awards Some awards I have been fortunate to have been recognized by: - Amazon Center on Secure & Trusted ML award. - Capitol One Fellowship. - SNSF Mobility Fellowship. - Patrick Denantes Memorial Prize for the best thesis in computer science. - Chorafas Foundation Prize for exceptional applied research. I am actively looking for Fall 2026 PhD students especially in: a. data-centric ML: data valuation, agentic markets, synthetic data; b. privacy and memorization in ML; c. foundations of robust and secure ML. If any of this is you, reach out! :) Teaching - Fall 2025: CSCI 699 Privacy Preserving Machine Learning (website) - Spring 2025: CSCI 599 Optimization for Machine Learning (website) - Fall 2024: CSCI 699 Privacy Preserving Machine Learning (website) My research Soon, a network of interacting AI agents will be mediating our social, cultural, and political exchanges, giving rise to complex “machine behavior”. This goes well beyond the current scope of machine learning research which focuses narrowly on developing better models on individual datasets, but rather requires taking a holistic view of the systems that arise from these agents interacting with society and with each other. I use tools from optimization, statistics, and economics to study and design such systems. I am currently focusing on the role of data in such ML ecosystems. Data is the most important factor determining the quality of an ML system. However, we understand very little about what makes data good or bad. Further, the most valuable data (e.g. health records) are either extremely expensive to collect or simply inaccesible. Some questions I am thinking about nowadays: Large-scale Private & Federated optimization. Medical data is subject to strict privacy regulations. How can we privately train ML models on data distributed across multiple hospitals without the data leaving the hospitals? This uses tools like Federated Learning, Differential Privacy, and optimization for large-scale machine learning. Data Valuation and Data Markets. The data commons that current AI relies on is disappearing. In order to build a sustainable data-ecosystem, people need to be compensated for their data. But, how much is a specific data point worth?. This questions requires understanding i) how data affects uncertainity in a ML model, and ii) the relative importance of datapoints. AI for Health. Healthcare comes with tons of data challenges on top of privacy concerns: the data may be highly heterogenous, and have missing features. Further, because of the high-stakes involved, fairness and equity, reliable uncertainity quantification, and interepretable predictions are all extremely important.
