My research lies in the broad field of compilers and programming systems, with an emphasis on program optimizations for heterogeneous computing and emerging architectures. My current focus is on building efficient systems for machine learning and graph processing applications. Before joining Mines in August 2014, I earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science from The College of William and Mary, where I worked with Professor Xipeng Shen. I received an M.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Mathematics both from Central South University, Hunan, China.  Awards NSF SPX Award, 2018 NSF CAREER Award, 2018 Best paper nomination, PACT, 2017 NSF grant to support research on optimizing applications for heterogeneous memory architectures (PI), 2016-2019 Supercomputing best paper award, 2015 Sole-PI NSF grant to support research on GPU scheduling, 2015-2017 NVIDIA CUDA teaching center, 2014 Stephen K.

I play guitar and piano to entertain myself (not sure whether I’m skilled enough to entertain others). I like history, philosophy, and physics. Last but not least, I was once a pretty good counter strike gamer and played on a team which won a championship in a local league.",
