Since such big and complex data are hard to be efficiently handled by conventional analysis methods, it is critical to develop innovative analysis tools based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), the machine learning techniques and up-to-date computational technology. By analyzing big data with using these techniques, we are pursuing to develop the advanced automatic systems that can enhance the life quality. Google SitesReport abusePage detailsPage updated Google SitesReport abuse",
