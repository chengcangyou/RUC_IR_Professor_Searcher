The paper also describes how to use Distributed Ledger Technology as a component of the implementation of Selene to manage the verifiability data in a distributed way for resilience and trust.Constantin Catalin Dragan, François Dupressoir, Kristian Gjøsteen, Thomas Haines, Peter B. Rønne, Morten Rotvold Solberg (2024)Machine-Checked Proofs of Accountability: How to sElect who is to Blame, In: Proceedings of the 28th European Symposium on Research in Computer Security, Part III3pp. 471-491 SpringerDOI: 10.1007/978-3-031-51479-1_24Accountability is a critical requirement of any deployed voting system as it allows unequivocal identification of misbehaving parties, including authorities. In this paper, we propose the first game-based definition of accountability and demonstrate its usefulness by applying it to the sElect voting system (Küsters et al., 2016) – a voting system that relies on no other cryptographic primitives than digital signatures and public key encryption. We strengthen our contribution by proving accountability for sElect in the EasyCrypt proof assistant. As part of this, we identify a few errors in the proof for sElect as presented by Küsters et al. (2016) for their definition of accountability. Finally, we reinforce the known relation between accountability and verifiability, and show that it is still maintained by our new game-based definition of accountability.Sergiu Bursuc, Constantin-Catalin Dragan, Steve Kremer (2019)Private votes on untrusted platforms: models, attacks and provable scheme, In: 2019 4TH IEEE EUROPEAN SYMPOSIUM ON SECURITY AND PRIVACY (EUROS&P)8806713pp. 606-620 IEEEDOI: 10.1109/EuroSP.2019.00050Modern e-voting systems deploy cryptographic protocols on a complex infrastructure involving different computing platforms and agents. It is crucial to have appropriate specification and evaluation methods to perform rigorous analysis of such systems, taking into account the corruption and computational capabilities of a potential attacker. In particular, the platform used for voting may be corrupted, e.g. infected by malware, and we need to ensure privacy and integrity of votes even in that case. We propose a new definition of vote privacy, formalized as a computational indistinguishability game, that allows to take into account such refined attacker models; we show that the definition captures both known and novel attacks against several voting schemes; and we propose a scheme that is provably secure in this setting. We moreover formalize and machine-check the proof in the EasyCrypt theorem prover.Constantin Catalin Dragan, Francois Dupressoir, Ehsan Estaji, Kristian Gjosteen, Thomas HAines, Peter Y. A. Ryan, Peter B. Ronne, Morten Rotvold Solberg (2023)Machine-checked proofs of privacy against malicious boards for Selene Co, In: Journal of computer security31(5)pp. 469-499 Ios PressDOI: 10.3233/JCS-230045Privacy is a notoriously difficult property to achieve in complicated systems and especially in electronic voting schemes. Moreover, electronic voting schemes is a class of systems that require very high assurance. The literature contains a number of ballot privacy definitions along with security proofs for common systems. Some machine-checked security proofs have also appeared. We define a new ballot privacy notion that captures a larger class of voting schemes. This notion improves on the state of the art by taking into account that verification in many schemes will happen or must happen after the tally has been published, not before as in previous definitions. As a case study we give a machine-checked proof of privacy for Selene, which is a remote electronic voting scheme which offers an attractive mix of security properties and usability. Prior to our work, the computational privacy of Selene has never been formally verified. Finally, we also prove that MiniVoting and Belenios satisfies our definition.Ferucio Laurentiu Tiplea, Constantin Catalin Dragan (2014)A necessary and sufficient condition for the asymptotic idealness of the GRS threshold secret sharing scheme, In: Information processing letters114(6)299pp. 299-303 ElsevierDOI: 10.1016/j.ipl.2014.01.008The study of the asymptotic idealness of the Goldreich-Ron-Sudan (GRS, for short) threshold secret sharing scheme was the subject of several research papers, where sufficient conditions were provided. In this paper a necessary and sufficient condition is established; namely, it is shown that the GRS threshold secret sharing scheme is asymptotically ideal under the uniform distribution on the secret space if and only if it is based on 1-compact sequences of co-primes.

If these sequences are not “compact”, then the CRT-based threshold secret sharing schemes may have a weak security in the sense of a massive loss of entropy or an arbitrarily large information rate. In this paper, compact sequences of co-primes are introduced, and their applications to the security of CRT-based threshold secret sharing schemes is throughout investigated. It is shown that all the results regarding the security of CRT-based threshold secret sharing schemes that use sequences of consecutive primes also hold for threshold secret sharing schemes that use compact sequences of co-primes. Moreover, compact sequences of co-primes may be significantly denser than sequences of consecutive primes of the same length, and ",
