Our research focuses on tumor phylogenetics in the context of intra-tumor heterogeneity. We develop phylogeny inference algorithms to study the progression of a tumor from its initial stage, where a healthy cell acquires its first somatic mutation, to the final stages, where tumor cells metastasize and invade and colonize distant organs and tissues. In addition, we develop algorithms to reconstruct patterns of spread in disease outbreaks. More broadly, we are interested in the application of combinatorial optimization techniques to answers questions and solve problems in biology. Please see my CV for more details.
