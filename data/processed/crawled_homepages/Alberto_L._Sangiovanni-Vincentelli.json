Buttner Chair of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley. He has been on the Faculty of the Department since 1976. He obtained an electrical engineering and computer science degree (\"Dottore in Ingegneria\") summa cum laude from the Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy, in 1971. In 1980-1981, he spent a year as a Visiting Scientist at the Mathematical Sciences Department of the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center. In 1987, he was a Visiting Professor at MIT. He has held a number of visiting professor positions at Italian Universities, including Politecnico di Torino, Universitaâ di Roma, La Sapienza, Universitaâ di Roma, Tor Vergata, Universitaâ di Pavia, Universitaâ di Pisa, Scuola di SantâAnna. He is a member of the Advisory Board of the Lester Center for Innovation of the Berkeley Haas School of Business and of the Berkeley Center for Western European Studies and is a member of the Berkeley Roundtable of the International Economy (BRIE). Since July 2019, he has served as Special Advisor to the Dean of Engineering of the University of California, Berkeley, for Entrepreneurship and as Chair of the Academic Advisors of the Berkeley SkyDeck accelerator. He is an Honorary Professor at Politecnico di Torino. He is an author of over 1,000 papers, 19 books, and 2 patents in design tools and methodologies, large-scale systems, embedded systems, hybrid systems, and innovation. He is recognized as one of the founding fathers of EDA and a leader in the field of Cyber Physical Systems design methodology and tools. He has given key notes at the major conferences in EDA (three key note addresses at Design Automation conference for the 40th, 50th and 60th anniversary, key note addresses at the International Conference on CAD for the 40th anniversary, International conference on Computer Design, and to all workshops in the area) control theory (twice at Conference on Decision and Control, European Control Conference), testing (key note at the International Test Conference), Integrated Circuit Design (European Solid State Circuit Conference), and Cyber Physical Systems (two key notes at Hybrid System Computation and Control, two key notes at the International Conference on Cyber Physical Systems). He has also given several Distinguished Lectures at major Universities such as Stanford, MIT, Columbia, Princeton University, University of Pennsylvania, University of California, Santa Barbara and San Diego, Washington University, British Columbia, Utah, Connecticut, Vanderbilt, College de France, VERIMAG, EPFL, KTH, ETH, Politecnico di Torino, Politecnico di Milano, University of Pisa, University of Pavia, among others. He is often invited to give addresses to companies such as IBM, Intel, and UTC at ad hoc meetings. He has graduated over 100 MS and PhD students.He served as an Associated Editor for the IEEE Transactions on CAD of Integrated Circuits and Systems, Formal Methods in System Design, ACM Transactions on Embedded Systems, ACM Transactions on CPS, ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems, and as a guest editor for several special issues of the Proceedings of the IEEE, of the IEEE Transactions on CAD and ACM Transactions. He is an Editor at Large of the Transactions of CAD.
