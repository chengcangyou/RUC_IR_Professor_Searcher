He has led numerous projects that integrate biology and robotics for healthcare, rehabilitation, and environmental applications. Professor Stefanini's major area of contribution is in bio-inspired robotics, including insect-scale robots and soft robots that emulate biological mechanics for safer and more adaptive human interaction, particularly in medical contexts like minimally invasive surgery and rehabilitation. His early work in medical micro-mechatronics introduced autonomous legged robotic tools for gastrointestinal endoscopy, considered seminal in the field. He is also co-inventor of the microsurgical robot commercialized by Medical Microinstruments (MMI), which has achieved both CE and FDA certifications. Collaborations with institutions like the Karolinska Institute led to biohybrid robotic systems recognized internationally by both engineering and neuroscience communities. Recent efforts include bioinspired underwater robotics for swarm operations and interactive robotic fish to study animal behavior. Through collaborations with companies like GE, Amazon, and MMI, he has translated academic research into real-world technologies—including patented systems for robotic manipulation and human-task automation. Email Share Prior to joining MBZUAI, Professor Stefanini was Director of the BioRobotics Institute at Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna (SSSA) in Italy, one of Europe's premier centers in robotics research. He also served as Dean of the Faculty of Applied Experimental Sciences at SSSA. Professor Stefanini conducted part of his doctoral research at Stanford University’s Center for Design Research. Since joining the SSSA faculty, he has led the Creative Engineering Design Lab, pioneering cross-disciplinary approaches at the interface of robotics, artificial intelligence, and biology. His research combines robotics with AI to develop intelligent, adaptive systems for medical, industrial, and environmental applications. Professor Stefanini has led several international projects on underwater swarm robotics and bio-hybrid sensing, where learning algorithms, autonomous behavior, and data-driven control are key. He is the author of over 240 scientific publications and the inventor of 18 international patents—10 of which have been industrially exploited by global leaders including Karl Storz, MMI, Amazon, Magneti Marelli, GE, and Pirelli. Professor Stefanini is the co-inventor of foundational technologies behind Medical Microinstruments (MMI S.p.A.), a surgical robotics company that has achieved international acclaim and was selected for TIME magazine’s 2024 list of Best Inventions. He is a member of the UAE’s Academy of Scientists and serves on the editorial board of the IEEE Transactions on Medical Robotics and Bionics. His recognitions include the “Intuitive Surgical Research Award” and three First Prizes at the International Micro Robot Maze Contest in Nagoya, Japan—early accolades for his innovation in microrobotics. He has organized high-impact workshops at the intersection of AI and robotics and is a frequent keynote speaker at major international conferences. His work has received widespread media coverage in The Economist, Euronews, Sky News, and Corriere della Sera, reflecting his ongoing contributions to the advancement of intelligent robotic systems.
