I completed Ph.D. at UCLA Computer Science Department in 2025, advised by Prof. Cho-Jui Hsieh. I received my B.Eng. degree from the CST department at Tsinghua University in 2020. My research focus is on machine learning (ML), especially developing more trustworthy and reliable AI models. Specifically, some of my current interests include but are not limited to: the interplay between generative AI, verifiers and formal methods; robustness and safety for state-of-the-art ML models; formal verification for ML; training verifiable ML models with guarantees; applications of verifiable ML in mission-critical scenarios. Group PhD students Shangjian Yin (Fall 2025-) Prospective Students: I am actively looking for motivated students to join my group, including prospective Ph.D. students (Fall 2026 admission), current undergraduates or Master’s students at UCR, or interns/collaborators/visitors.
