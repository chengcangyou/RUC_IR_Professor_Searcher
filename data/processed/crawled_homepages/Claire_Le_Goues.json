I am also the Associate Department Head for Faculty within S3D. My research interests span software engineering and programming languages, and especially in how to construct, maintain, evolve, improve/debug, and assure high-quality software systems. My group of brilliant students and collaborators is called squaresLab. I teach software engineering and program analysis at the undergraduate, masters, and PhD levels and co-direct the REUSE@CMU summer program. Students or potential students interested in working with me can learn more here. If you would like to meet with me, your best bet is to email me while CCing Jennifer Cooper (cooperj@andrew.cmu.edu). If you want to propose some times (always helpful!), my calendar is available. Relevant trivia: My last name is pronounced “Le-Gwess.”",
