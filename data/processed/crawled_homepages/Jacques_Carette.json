(Univ. de Montreal), BMath (Univ. of Waterloo) Research Interests You can read a longer description but roughly my interests are in: Mechanized Mathematics, especially system building (MathScheme). A nice glossy overview was published some time ago. Program Generation and Program Transformation . Dependent types, in particular I use Agda a lot. Active member of the MathScheme project at McMaster University, which actively collaborates with the Tetrapod project. Associate member of the Ontario Research Center for Computer Algebra.
