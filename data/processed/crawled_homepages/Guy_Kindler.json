My research lies mostly within theoretical computer science and its interface with mathematics. If you're not here by mistake, you might be interested in one of those: My google scholar site, and my DBLP listing. The Hebrew University Theory of Computing Research Seminar, which I am organizing. My PhD Thesis, which includes my famousest unpublished result with Muli Safra named Noise-insensitive Boolean-Functions are Juntas (linked version includes rare original editing comments by authors). You can find out what courses I teach here (that's a Hebrew site, but there's a link for English at the upper left). If you're interested in a post-doc position or PhD mentoring, you may try to send me an email (no promises). Contact info. If you are trying to reach me, you probably got the email right, I'm just not very good at following my inbox. Feel free to send a reminder.
