His research is focused upon hard real-time, distributed, and cyber-physical systems. His work takes a novel approach to modern architectures and safety-critical multi-threaded applications; where architecture and scheduling complement one another to improve system performance rather than detracting from it. The inter-thread cache benefit is one such technique that reduces the worst-case execution time of multi-threaded applications in the presence of cache memory. Research Areas Real-Time Systems, Schedulability, Cyber-Physical Systems",
