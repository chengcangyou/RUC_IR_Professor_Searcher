Our work pioneers novel interaction techniques with emerging user interfaces through software and hardware design, development and evaluation. Dr. Audrey Girouard and her lab currently research deformable materials and flexible displays. With a new generation of displays — flexible displays — that will make their way in our homes within a few years, we are interested in determining how their unique characteristics, such as their thinness, lightweight and flexibility, can be exploited to offer new interaction techniques to users, complementary to the current touch capabilities of rigid screens. Alfrancis Guerrero, Sara Nabil, Joanie Ouellet, Alex Eady, Audrey Girouard and Lee Jones discussing during an outdoors meeting in the fall near the lab.
