I work in Artificial Intelligence at the intersection of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Language Understanding and Robotics. Prior to joining MLD's faculty I spent three wonderful years as a post doctoral researcher first at UC Berkeley working with Jitendra Malik and then at Google Research in Mountain View working with the video group. I completed my Ph.D. in GRASP, UPenn with Jianbo Shi . I did my undergraduate studies at the National Technical University of Athens and before that I was in Crete. Prospective students: If you want to join CMU as PhD student, just mention my name in your application. Otherwise, if you would like to join our group in any other capacity, please fill this form and then please send me a short email note without any documents.

Our ultimate goal is to build machines that will autonomously and in interactions with humans and with the environment acquire and continuously improve world models, that would let them reason through consequences of their and others decisions, to surpass humans in both dexterity and creativity. Topics we currently focus on include representation learning, video understanding, 2D/3D unified vision language models, generative modeling, learning simulators from data, real2sim and sim2real robot learning, reinforcement learning, continual learning.
