Prior to that I was a postdoc at MIT (2015-2018) and Northeastern University (2017-2018). I completed my PhD at the Weizmann Institute, where I was extremely fortunate to have been advised by Prof. Oded Goldreich. I am interested in theoretical computer science at large and especially in cryptography and complexity theory. My brother Guy also does Crypto!
