Email Google Scholar Hi there👋! This is JC, currently a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor with Department of Computing (COMP) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, leading the Lumen Group and, by courtesy, with Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics (LSGI). I defended my Ph.D. in December 2020 at the same university, during which period I was lucky to be supported by the Hong Kong PhD Fellowship (HKPFS) from Hong Kong RGC. Prior to that, I received my M.Phil. from Waseda University, Japan, and B.Eng. from Sichuan University, China, all in Computer Science and AI/ML. From 2021 to 2022, I did postdoctoral training at the University of Sydney, Australia, where I was also a Visiting Ph.D. from 2019 to 2020. Even earlier before I did my Ph.D., I spent nearly 2 years in the investment banking industry after Waseda. I am generally interested in Efficient AI, which target learning/modeling with Limited Resources in terms of Data, Computing Capability, as well as exploring their derivative Applications on wide spectrums. Some specific topics include Zero/Few-shot Learning, Federated Learning, Representation Learning, Model Compression, and Lightweight Solutions for Foundation/Large Models. Our works are published in various prestigious venues, including AAAI, IJCAI, CVPR, ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, MM, ATC, ICDCS, TNNLS, TPAMI, TMM, TC, TCSS, etc. As the Principal Investigator (PI), I have secured multiple external research grants, including General Research Funds (GRF) from Hong Kong RGC, Young Scientists Fund from NSFC, Industrial Funds, etc. I have served as Chair Members for multiple leading CS conference, like Publicity Chair for SRDS 2022 (Vienna, Austria), Track Chair (TPC Vice-Chair) for VTC 2024 Fall (Washington DC, USA), Session Coordinator for ACM-MM 2025 (Dublin, Ireland). I have regularly served as Area Chair and/or Senior PC for prestigious venues like ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, ACM-MM, AAAI, IJCAI, etc. I am currently serving as Associate Editor for Pattern Recognition (IF=8.0) and IEEE OJ-CS (IF=8.2), and serving as Guest Editor for IEEE TCSS (IF=5.0). I am a member of IEEE and CCF. 🌏 Lumen Group 👈👈 Click for more information We are actively looking for self-motivated PhD Students, Postdoctoral Researchers, and Research Assistants to work and have fun together on multiple research projects.
