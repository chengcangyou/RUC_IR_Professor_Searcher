I lead the LangSec (Language-Based Security) group conducting research at the intersection of computer security, programming languages, formal methods and software engineering. Our research interests are in many aspects of security, from both theoretical and practical angles, spanning core and emerging areas such as information flow control, web and mobile application security, IoT security, low-level security, program analysis and verification, and logics.
