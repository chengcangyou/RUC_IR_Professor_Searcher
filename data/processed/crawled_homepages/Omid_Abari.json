I received my PhD from Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), working with Professor Dina Katabi and Professor Anantha Chandrakasan. I received my Master's degree from MIT and my Bachelor's degree from Carleton University, Canada. Research Interests: My research group focuses on developing smart Internet of Things (IoT) systems across the full stackâfrom energy-efficient hardware to adaptive, AI-driven software and applications. We design and build integrated softwareâhardware systems that enable ubiquitous sensing, intelligent computation, and seamless connectivity to support emerging data-driven applications.
