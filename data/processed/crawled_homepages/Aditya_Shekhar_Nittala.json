My research group is actively working on developing novel technologies that bring computing and interactivity closer to the user’s body. Specifically, we envision a new computing paradigm: Epidermal Computing, which is enabled through Epidermal Devices: devices that reside on the human epidermis. Epidermal Devices are soft, ultra-slim, adapt themselves to the complex geometries of the body, and enable a wide range of expressive interactions. We also create computational design tools to aid the fabrication of these devices. Our research is interdisciplinary and we blend diverse disciplines (e.g. Materials Science, Electrical Engineering, Digital Fabrication, Printed Electronics, and Human-Computer Interaction) for solving fundamental research problems. Previously, I received my MSc degree in Computer Science from the University of Calgary in Canada where I worked on designing and building novel interaction techniques for mobile devices and Mobile Augmented Reality.
