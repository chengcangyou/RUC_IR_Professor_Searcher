Before, I completed my PhD in Computer Science at University of British Columbia (Vancouver, Canada), working on various sketch-based modeling projects under supervision of Alla Sheffer. Before that (2004-2010) I did my Bachelor's and Master's (oh childhood!) at Mechanics & Mathematics Department of Novosibirsk State University (Akademgorodok, Novosibirsk, Russia) under supervision of Olga Nechaeva. CV Here (updated a while ago). Research interests Currently the top interest for me is sketching and whatever 3D we can create with it. I'm generally interested in geometry processing and computer graphics as a tool for creating true art. Outside computer science Outside the department, I'm an argentine tango dancer. I also occasionally play/compose/record music, mostly on guitar (blues, classics, tango, slowly moving towards jazz). contact Phone: (+1) 514 343 6111 Ext. 35937 Pavillon AndrÃ©-Aisenstadt Room 3357 C.P. 6128, succ.
