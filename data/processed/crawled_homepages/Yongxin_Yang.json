Previously, he was a Lecturer in Machine Learning at University of Surrey. He received his PhD from QMUL in 2017, supervised by Professor Timothy Hospedales. His research is in the area of machine learning (transfer learning, domain generalization, and meta learning) and its applications in finance (portfolio optimization and derivatives pricing) and medical genetics. Apart from being a (rather casual) researcher, he is an ACCA certified accountant and a professional web designer. He co-founded a few companies and holds some consulting roles in industry. news Feb 3, 2022 PhenoApt was accepted by AJHG 🎉 selected publications MEDFAIR: Benchmarking Fairness for Medical Imaging Yongshuo Zong, Yongxin Yang, and Timothy Hospedales In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2023 Mixture of Normalizing Flows for European Option Pricing Yongxin Yang, and Timothy M Hospedales In Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI), 2023 On Calibration of Mathematical Finance Models by Hypernetworks Yongxin Yang, and Timothy M Hospedales In European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD), 2023 PhenoApt leverages clinical expertise to prioritize candidate genes via machine learning Zefu Chen, Yu Zheng, Yongxin Yang, Yingzhao Huang, Sen Zhao, Hengqiang Zhao, Chenxi Yu, and 4 more authors The American Journal of Human Genetics, 2022 Augmented sliced Wasserstein distances Xiongjie Chen, Yongxin Yang, and Yunpeng Li In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2022 Loss Function Learning for Domain Generalization by Implicit Gradient Boyan Gao, Henry Gouk, Yongxin Yang, and Timothy Hospedales In International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2022 Dynamic multi-period sparse portfolio selection model with asymmetric investors’ sentiments Ju Wei, Yongxin Yang, Mingzhu Jiang, and Jianguo Liu Expert Systems with Applications, 2021 Incorporating Prior Financial Domain Knowledge into Neural Networks for Implied Volatility Surface Prediction Yu Zheng, Yongxin Yang, and Bowei Chen In ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), 2021 EvoGrad: Efficient Gradient-Based Meta-Learning and Hyperparameter Optimization Ondrej Bohdal, Yongxin Yang, and Timothy Hospedales In Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2021 Index Tracking with Cardinality Constraints: A Stochastic Neural Networks Approach Yu Zheng, Bowei Chen, Timothy M Hospedales, and Yongxin Yang In AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), 2020 Online Meta-Critic Learning for Off-Policy Actor-Critic Methods Wei Zhou, Yiying Li, Yongxin Yang, Huaimin Wang, and Timothy M Hospedales In Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2020 Feature-Critic Networks for Heterogeneous Domain Generalization Yiying Li, Yongxin Yang, Wei Zhou, and Timothy M Hospedales In International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2019 Deep Neural Decision Trees Yongxin Yang, Irene Garcia Morillo, and Timothy M Hospedales In ICML Workshop on Human Interpretability in Machine Learning (WHI), 2018 Trace Norm Regularised Deep Multi-Task Learning Yongxin Yang, and Timothy M Hospedales In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) Workshop, 2017 Deep Multi-task Representation Learning: A Tensor Factorisation Approach Yongxin Yang, and Timothy Hospedales In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2017 Gated Neural Networks for Option Pricing: Rationality by Design Yongxin Yang, Yu Zheng, and Timothy M Hospedales In AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), 2017 Multivariate Regression on the Grassmannian for Predicting Novel Domains Yongxin Yang, and Timothy M Hospedales In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016 A Unified Perspective on Multi-Domain and Multi-Task Learning Yongxin Yang, and Timothy M Hospedales In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2015",
