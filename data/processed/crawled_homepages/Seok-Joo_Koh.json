CCIS In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) refers to vehicle systems that combine entertainment and information delivery to drivers and passengers. Configurable Car Infotainment Service (CCIS) is a service that helps users to more easily manage and control In-Vehicle infotainment devices and content. VLC-IoT Visible-light communication (VLC) transmits data by intensity modulating optical sources, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes (LDs), faster than the persistence of the human eye. The goal of IoT-VLC is to design a framework of IoT services based on VLC.
