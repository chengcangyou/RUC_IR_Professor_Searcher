Profile Research Teaching and supervision Publications Grants and funding Contact Profile Research Teaching and supervision Publications Grants and funding Contact Profile Biography Dr. Abolghasemi is a Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) at the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, at the University of Essex. He received the Ph.D. degree from University of Surrey, Guildford, UK in 2011. Upon completion of the PhD, he held a postdoctoral research assistant position at Brunel University, contributing to an EPSRC-funded project on application of compressive sensing for terahertz imaging. His primary research encompasses signal and image processing, computer vision, and deep learning, with a specific focus on compressive sensing and its expansion into emerging fields. Driven by his interest in advancing technology, his research findings have yielded innovative solutions in medical, agricultural, and industrial applications, resulting in publications in esteemed journals and conferences. Currently, Dr. Abolghasemi is actively engaged in broadening the practical applications of his theoretical knowledge. His expertise extends to cutting-edge technologies, including smart and adaptive low-power sensing and communication, wireless image transmission, compressed and lightweight neural networks, and artificial intelligence. These advancements find applications in crucial sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, and global environmental challenges. Recognised for his contributions, Dr. Abolghasemi is a Senior Member of IEEE and a recipient of the IEEE Young Investigator Award (2018). He has served on EPSRC prioritisation panels and the Peer Review College, and as an Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems. He has also participated as a technical program committee member and keynote speaker at several flagship conferences. In addition, he regularly reviews for numerous leading journals, including IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, IEEE Signal Processing Letters, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, and Signal Processing.
