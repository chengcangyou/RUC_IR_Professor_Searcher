My main focus is on abstract interpretation and more specifically on symbolic abstractions: Static Analysis by abstract interpretation, foundations and practical aspects of static analysis. Shape analysis MemCAD ERC Project the Xisa analyzer Static Analysis of embedded, safety critical software the Astrée project: static analysis, for proving the absence of runtime errors in safety critical embedded software. Commercial support by AbsInt (see here for more info). Static analysis of probabilistic programs. In the past, I have also worked on the following topics. Although not currently working on these, I am still following new results in these areas. Certified compilation the Lcertify translation validator Slicing, dependence semantics Static analysis of Spreadsheet Applications Static analysis of JavaScript Software Software MemCAD static analyzer, as part of the MemCAD ERC Project. Astrée static analyzer. LCertify translation validator library. Projects VeriAMOS ANR Project. MemCAD ERC Project (ERC Starting Grant). MBAT. Astrée. AstréeA. ANR VerAsCo. ANR AnaStaSec.
