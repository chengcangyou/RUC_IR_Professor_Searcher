My research interests include computer graphics, interactive visualization, computational geometry, and open source software for education. Previously I was a student and then Post-Doctoral Lecturer at MIT in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science doing research in the Computer Graphics Group which is part of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). I received an NSF Early CAREER Award in 2009, the Rensselaer School of Science Outstanding Teaching Award in 2017, and the Rensselaer Trustees' Outstanding Teacher Award in 2019.
