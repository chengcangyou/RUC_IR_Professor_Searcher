My research interests focus on natural language processing, with the fundamental goal of building models capable of human-level understanding of natural language. My lab is currently working on testing and improving the capabilities of large language models and vision and language models, developing culturally-competent AI, and responsible NLP applications in sensitive domains (e.g., legal, medical). Before joining UBC, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Allen Institute for AI (AI2) and the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington. Prior to that, I did my PhD (2019), M.Sc. (2015), and B.Sc. (2013) in Computer Science in Bar-Ilan University. I was part of the Natural Language Processing lab where I worked on lexical and compositional semantics. I'm a member of the UBC NLP Group, CAIDA, Language Sciences, and ICICS.
