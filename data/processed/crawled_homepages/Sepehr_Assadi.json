This in particular includes sublinear algorithms and lower bounds in various models for processing massive datasets, and specifically massive graphs, such as streaming, distributed, massively parallel, and sublinear time algorithms. More broadly, I am also interested in graph theory, communication complexity, online algorithms, and algorithmic game theory. A&C Seminar: Janani Sundaresan, Helia Yazdanyar, and I are organizing the Algorithms & Complexity (A&C) Seminar currently (Fall 2025). Send us an email if you'd like to give a talk. Reading groups: In Fall 2025, I am running a reading group on Space Bounded Computation. Photo courtesy of Joe Petrik SIAM Symposium on Simplicity in Algorithms (SOSA26): Eva Rotenberg and I are chairing SOSA 2026 -- submit your most exciting and simplest work to the conference! the list of accepted papers is available here. Hope to see you in Vancouver in January 2026! Prospective Graduate Students: The School of Computer Science at UWaterloo offers partially-funded MS and fully-funded PhD positions with three separate application deadlines each year. You can also learn about the available positions in the A&C group here -- if you have a strong background in theoretical computer science and/or mathematics What does a strong background roughly look like? The most important factor is having mathematical maturity. Beyond that, this also includes but definitely is not limited to one or more of: * Having done research (and possibly publications) on these topics; * Having passed a few graduate and advanced-level undergraduate courses, or participated in reading groups on algorithms, complexity theory, combinatorics, probability, information theory, and/or algebra; * Having participated in IOI/IMO or ACM-ICPC or similar national or international competitions; * Having read a number of papers or followed developments in recent years on one or more area of research of your interest in TCS or Math, and can explain their significance to others. , consider applying to our graduate program and mention Algorithms and Complexity as your research interest. I am personally not admitting new students at the moment and as such may not be able to respond to emails regarding graduate admissions. Personal: My other half, Mina Tahmasbi Arashloo, works on Networking at University of Waterloo. About Me I am an Associate Professor and a Faculty of Mathematics Research Chair in the Cheriton School of Computer Science at University of Waterloo and part of the Algorithms & Complexity (A&C) Group. My primary research interests are in algorithm design and complexity theory for modern models of computation and in particular sublinear algorithms and lower bounds---broadly interpreted---for massive graph problems. Prior to joining University of Waterloo in 2023, I was an Assistant Professor at the Computer Science Department at Rutgers University. Even before that, I spent a wonderful year as a postdoctoral researcher in Theory of Computation Group at the Computer Science Department of Princeton University, supported by the Simons Algorithms and Geometry Collaboration. I received my PhD in 2018 from the Computer & Information Science Department at University of Pennsylvania and was extremely fortunate to have Sanjeev Khanna as my advisor. My PhD thesis was on Combinatorial Optimization for Massive Datasets. During my PhD, I spent the summer of 2017 as a research intern at Google Research (NYC) with their amazing Algorithms and Optimization team. I got my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology. My research has been generously supported by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation (Sloan Research Fellowship), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) (Discovery Grant), the Faculty of Mathematics Research Chair from University of Waterloo, the US National Science Foundation (NSF) (Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award), Google Research (Research Scholar Program), and Rutgers Research Council (Fulcrum Award). I am honored to receive the Presburger Award 2025. A third-person bio is available here.

Coloring Graphs with Few Colors in the Streaming Model SODA 2026 Sepehr Assadi, Janani Sundaresan, Helia Yazdanyar Summary: This paper examines the following basic question in the streaming model: can we distinguish graphs with \"small\" chromatic number (say, a constant), vs \"large\" chromatic number (say n^{o(1)} or even sqrt{n}) using a limited space (ignoring time complexity) in the streaming model? The results include various upper and lower bounds for single-pass algorithms in adversarial-order, random-order, and insertion-deletion streams. Better Bounds for Semi-Streaming Single-Source Shortest Paths SODA 2026 Sepehr Assadi, Gary Hoppenworth, Janani Sundaresan [arXiv] Summary: Better upper and lower bounds on pass-complexity of semi-streaming algorithms for single-source (1+eps)-approximate shortest paths: O(log^2) pass algorithm and Omega(log n) pass lower bound. Previously, the upper bound was some unspecified polylog(n) and the low",
