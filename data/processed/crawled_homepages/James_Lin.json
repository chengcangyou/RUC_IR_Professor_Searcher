The center is one of the leading university-level supercomputer centers in China, with the fastest supercomputer Siyuan-1 (6PFlops) and the largest HPC team (30+ members) of any university in China. His current research interests include performance analysis at the microarchitecture level for emerging many-core processors, and large-scale applications on supercomputers. He has published more than 30 papers on these topics. He has served on the steering committee of IEEE CLUSTER (2020-) and the standing committee of CCF TCHPC (2020-). Additionally, he has served as a TPC member and reviewer for many HPC conferences and journals, including SC, IPDPS, and Transaction on Computers (TC). He is a senior member of the ACM and CCF. In 2002, he earned a BS degree in Computer Science from Zhejiang University, and in 2005, a MS degree in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. In 2018, he was awarded a PhD in mathematics and computing science from Tokyo Institute of Technology, under the supervision of Prof. Satoshi Matsuoka.
