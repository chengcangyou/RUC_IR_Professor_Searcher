Güçlütürk (Yagmur) Assistant professor - Artificial Intelligence Principal Investigator - Donders Centre for Cognition Principal Investigator - Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour Dr. Yağmur Güçlütürk is a Principal Investigator at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour, where she leads the Neural Engineering Lab. Her research sits at the intersection of artificial intelligence, neurotechnology, and perception, focusing on computational approaches that interface with or explore human sensory experience.Her lab plays a key role in the development and refinement of emerging neurotechnologies, including visual prostheses, cochlear implants, and neural decoding techniques. A central goal is to develop neural implants that can restore a form of visual experience in blind individuals. Drawing on techniques from machine learning, computer vision, and signal processing, the group creates simulations, experimental frameworks, and algorithms designed to shape artificial input into perceptually meaningful experiences.In parallel, she investigates the foundations of perception, including visual, auditory, and crossmodal aesthetic experience. Her work is interdisciplinary, collaborative, and human-centred, advancing the development of intelligent technologies shaped by perceptual insights and grounded in the needs and perspectives of users.
