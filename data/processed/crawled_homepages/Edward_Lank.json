Please see https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/people-profiles/edward-lank About Me I am a professor and Cheriton Faculty Fellow in the Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. My research is in the area of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). In particular, my research focuses on: Intelligent User Interfaces Mobile, Multi-Touch, and Free-space Gestural Interaction Movement and Input Modeling in Interfaces Alongside my appointment at the University of Waterloo, I am currently (2019 - 2023) an Inria International Research Chair attached to Équipe LOKI at Inria Lille-Nord Europe in Villeneuve d'Ascq, France. If I am not at Waterloo, you can frequently find me (and my students) in Lille, France. My current research projects page is somewhat out of date, but you can see how I spend my time by browsing my Google Scholar page, linked at the top of this page from Publications (Publication venue rankings are available here).
