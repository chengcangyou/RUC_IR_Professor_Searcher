He received his PhD from TCD in 2006 and has published over 30 peer reviewed publications in journals and conference proceedings e.g. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG) and International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV). Furthermore, he filed 4 patents. Dr. Manzke's focusses on high performance low power graphics architectures and algorithms. This work is equally applicable to computer vision problems. Interactive Computer Graphics and Computer Vision applications require systems that deliver high performance while consuming very small amounts power. This is increasingly important for ubiquitous mobile applications such as augmented reality. He and his team of researchers address these research questions by investigating microarchitectures and algorithms that are specifically designed for Visual Computing computation. He works closely with industry partners such as Xilinx, Dolphin Interconnect Solutions, Intel, Sony, Toshiba, IBM, and Movidius on these problems. Dr. Manzke is supervising and supervised in total 13 team members: Postdocs(3), PhD(8), and Research Engineers(2). He has received 8 grants from Science Foundation Ireland, IRCSET, Enterprise Ireland, and Irish Research Council with a total amount of 1,826,319 and a total amount allocated to the candidate of 1,155,159.
