Research Interests My primary research theme is the mathematics of computation (how to describe the act of performing computations by man, alien, or machine by mathematics). This includes computing and calculations involving mathematical structures that are intrinsically infinite in nature, but must necessarily be computed using only finite resources. In addition, I maintain a serious professional interest in other areas of computer science such as information retrieval and human-computer interaction. Currently, I work in the following areas: Computability Theory Rewriting and Lambda Calculus Complexity Theory Information Retrieval Symbolic Dynamical Systems I have previously been active in the following areas: Constructive/Computable/Recursive Mathematics Human-computer Interaction Biocomputing Publications In (a reasonable approximation to) reverse chronological order.
