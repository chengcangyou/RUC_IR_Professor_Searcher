For more information, please see Christophe's Computer Science profile. I am a Lecturer in Computer Security in the University of Birmingham's School of Computer Science, and a member of the Security and Privacy research group. I am also actively involved within Oxford's Mathematical Institute, where I helped founding the Cryptography group. I teach the Secure Programming and part of the Advanced Cryptography modules at Birmingham, both of them part of our Master in Cybersecurity. I will also teach an Advanced Cryptography reading course for the Master in Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science at Oxford. I am always willing to supervise good and well-motivated students at undergraduate, master and PhD levels. Have a look at previous student projects and feel free to contact me to learn more about potential research projects. Previously I was a Research Fellow at the University of Oxford's Mathematical Institute, and prior to that I worked at Université catholique de Louvain's Department of Electrical Engineering and at University College London's Computer Science Department.
