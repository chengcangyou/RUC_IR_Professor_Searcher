I am currently an Assistant Professor in the College of Computer Science and Software Engineering at Shenzhen University. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Technology from Hunan University in 2025, under the supervision of Prof. Guoqing Xiao and Prof. Kenli Li. Prior to that, I received my Master’s degree in 2021 under the supervision of Prof. Wenjun Jiang, and my Bachelor’s degree in 2018, both from Hunan University. From 2022 to 2024, I was a visiting Ph.D. student at Nanyang Technological University, supervised by Prof. Gao Cong. My current research focuses on recommendation systems, especially on serendipity and diversity, aiming to enhance long-term user experience. Moving forward, my work will focus on the following areas: Multi-objective Recommendation. Exploring methods to improve diversity, fairness, and serendipity in recommendation systems while preserving accuracy. Multi-modal Recommendation. Incorporating multimodal features—especially speech signals—to enrich user and item representations. Generative Recommendation. Leveraging generative models (e.g., diffusion models, large language models) to simulate user behavior, augment data, and enable controllable recommendation generation. 🔥 News 📢 Join My Group I actively welcome motivated undergraduate students at SZU to join my research group. Most students will be involved in collaborations with the following researchers: Dr. Jiawei Wang – Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the NExT++ Lab, National University of Singapore. His research focuses on LLM, and we work together on agent-based recommendation systems. Dr. Weiguang Chen – Senior Engineer at Huawei. His research centers on speech signal processing, and our collaboration focuses on incorporating speech features into recommendation tasks. 📝 Selected Publications TKDE 2024 Accurate and Scalable Graph Convolutional Networks for Recommendation Based on Subgraph Propagation, Xueqi Li, Guoqing Xiao, Yuedan Chen, Kenli Li, and Gao Cong.
