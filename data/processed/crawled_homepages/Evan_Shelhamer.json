I earned my PhD in Computer Science at UC Berkeley in 2019 advised by Trevor Darrell as a member of Berkeley AI Research. Earlier on, I earned dual degrees in computer science (artificial intelligence concentration) and psychology at UMass Amherst advised by Erik Learned-Miller. I like to solve problems in artificial intelligence and scientific prototyping: research for computer vision and machine learning, and hacking, adapting, and deploying open-source research code. I have over ten years’ experience in research and development for computer vision and machine learning and served as the lead developer of the Caffe deep learning framework from version 0.1 to 1.0.
