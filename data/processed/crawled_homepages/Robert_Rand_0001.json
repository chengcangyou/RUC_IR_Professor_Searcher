My main interest is in applying techniques from programming languages and formal verification to the domain of quantum computation. Two of my main projects are the QWIREÂ quantum circuit language (with Jennifer Paykin) and the VOQC verified optimizing compiler (with Kesha Hietala). I’m currently interested in verified optimization, error-correction, type systems and programming abstractions for quantum computing. I’m working on a book on verified quantum programming! Email me if you’d like to use the book for your own course. If you’re interested in doing research with me: Please reach out! Recent News All news â¯ August 2025 Compositional Quantum Control Flow with Efficient Compilation in Qunity with Mikahil Mints, Finn Voichick and Leonidas Lampropoulos was accepted to OOPSLA 2025! This is the first implementation of the Qunity quantum programming language, now with generalized pattern matching! August 2025 A Language for Quantifying Quantum Network Behavior with Anita Buckley and the team at USI Lugano was accepted to OOPSLA 2025! This builds upon our prior work on BellKAT, adding support for probabilistic reasoning. January 2025 Our project proposal, Verifying Error-Correcting Codes for Broad Deployment, was selected for funding by IBM!
