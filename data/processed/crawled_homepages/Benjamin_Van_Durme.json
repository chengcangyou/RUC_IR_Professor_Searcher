I am a member of the Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP) and lead Natural Language Understanding research at the Human Language Technology Center of Excellence (HLTCOE). My work focuses on helping people work with large amounts of information. This involves understanding what is in documents and images, helping people find that information, and being able help answer questions about that content. With my collaborators I publish on topics in natural language processing, data mining, social media analysis, machine learning, linguistic semantics, and generally most things Artificial Intelligence or Cognitive Science. See Research Areas for details about our current interests. Our work with colleagues in decompositional semantics is organized at Decomp.io. I am also the research lead at Microsoft Semantic Machines. Office: Hackerman 316C Email: vandurme@jhu.edu",
