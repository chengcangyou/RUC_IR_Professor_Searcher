Prior to this, she was a Tenure-track Assistant Professor at ShanghaiTech University from 2021 and a Research Assistant Professor at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University since 2020. She received her Ph.D. from the University of Hong Kong in 2020, under the supervision of Prof. Yizhou Yu, with support from the Hong Kong PhD Fellowship. Dr. Yang obtained her B.S. in Computer Science from the Chu Kochen Honors College at Zhejiang University in 2016. She has published over 60 papers in leading venues such as TPAMI, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, NeurIPS, ICLR, and SIGGRAPH. As the first or corresponding author, Sibei Yang has contributed to more than 30 papers in top-tier (CCF-A) journals and conferences. Research Interests Our current research interests primarily focus on 1) Multimodal Large Language Models (LLM/MLLM), 2) Vision-Language Understanding and Generation, 3) Embodied AI, and 4) Open-world Visual Understanding. Our mission is to facilitate the learning of unified and universal perception, understanding, reasoning, generation, and interaction within the realm of an open world. We envision that harnessing multimodal information—particularly vision and language—in a unified and generalizable manner, and enabling its deployment in real-world physical interactions, is fundamental to advancing our understanding of the world and fostering the emergence of artificial intelligence. 我们正在招2026秋季入学的硕士生和博士生，欢迎感兴趣的同学附上简历联系我sibeiyang9@gmail.com。如果想从学生视角了解我们可以联系组内师兄石骋shicheng2025@connect.hku.hk News Sep 19, 2025 5 papers are accepted by NeurIPS 2025 🎊🎊🎊 Aug 16, 2025 Sibei Yang will serve as Area Chair for ICLR 2026 Jun 26, 2025 7 papers are accepted by ICCV 2025 👏👏👏 May 20, 2025 2 papers are accepted by ACL 2025 🎉🎉 Feb 27, 2025 6 papers are accepted by CVPR 2025 🥳🥳🥳 Jan 22, 2025 3 papers are accepted by ICLR 2025 🎊🎊🎊 Dec 3, 2024 Sibei Yang will serve as Area Chair for ICCV 2025 Oct 1, 2024 Congratulations to Cheng Shi for once again receiving the National Scholarship! 🎉🎉🎉 Aug 13, 2024 One Paper is accepted by TPAMI 2024 👏👏👏 Jul 5, 2024 Three papers are accepted by ECCV 2024 🎉🎉🎉 Feb 27, 2024 Two papers are accepted by CVPR 2024 🎊🎊🎊 Jan 15, 2024 One paper is accepted by ICLR 2024 🐲🐲🐲 Dec 30, 2023 Congratulations to Cheng Shi for receiving the National Scholarship, and to Jiajin Tang for achieving the Outstanding Student Award.👏👏👏 Sep 23, 2023 2 papers Free-Bloom (Zero-Shot Text-to-Video Generation) and DDCoT (CoT Prompting for Multimodal Reasoning in LMs) are accepted by NeurIPS 2023 🎉🎉🎉 Jul 14, 2023 5 papers are accepted by ICCV 2023 🎉 May 27, 2023 Sibei Yang will serve as Area Chair for WACV2024.
