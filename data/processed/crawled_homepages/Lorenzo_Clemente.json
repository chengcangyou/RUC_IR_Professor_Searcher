I do research at LaBRI as a member, and current head, of the team \"Modelling and Technologies for the Verification (MTV)\".

My goal is to develop new verification algorithms for timed automata that can scale to industrial-size applications. Current topics include: Acceleration techniques for timed automata and linear hybrid systems Efficient algorithms for model-checking timed automata, in particular, coarse and dynamic abstractions Verification of communicating timed automata, distributed and concurrent real-time systems My work is or has been supported by several projects: ROBSYS - Robustness of Autonomous Systems Impulsion research network - U.
