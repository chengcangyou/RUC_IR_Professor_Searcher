I am also an affiliate faculty at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington and the chair of WiGRAPH. My research group creates design tools and systems that will revolutionize how we build physical artifacts. A central challenge for design tools in manufacturing is the need to simultaneously nurture the creative ability to conceive novel designs and the analytical capacity to critically evaluate and optimize functionality and production. My group tackles this challenge through innovative solutions that are grounded in the fundamentals of geometry processing and combine insights from machine learning and programming languages. My research has been recognized by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Fellowship, MIT Technology Review's Innovators Under 35 award, an NSF CAREER award, and faculty awards from Google, Amazon, and Intel, among others. I am honored to receive the 2024 ACM SIGGRAPH Significant New Researcher Award.View my Publications, News, and moreInfo for Prospective StudentsTeaching Fall 2019: Computational Fabrication (CSE 556) Spring 2019: Reseach Seminar: Geometry Processing (CSE 590-K) Winter 2019: Special Topics in Computational Fabrication (CSE 599-J1) Fall 2018: Computational Fabrication (CSE 556) Bio I grew up in Brazil, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Electronics Engineering from UFRJ and a Master's in Mathematics from IMPA. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at MIT in 2018. After that, I spent several wonderful years at the University of Washington, where I served as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and was later promoted to Associate Professor with tenure. I joined Brown University in 2025.",
