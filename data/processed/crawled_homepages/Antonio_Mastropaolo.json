His research lies at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Software Engineering (SE), with a strong emphasis on the automation of SE-related practices. His work promotes explainability, efficiency, and optimization from both a model-centric perspective (e.g., robustness and adaptability of foundation models such as GitHub Copilot) and an output-centric perspective (e.g., documentation and summarization of code components). More broadly, his research addresses the reliability and efficiency of AI systems for SE, advancing next-generation intelligent tools that improve transparency, scalability, and developer productivity. news Oct. 2025 ⚙️ Our paper: A Systematic Literature Review of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Large Code Models has been accepted for publication in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM) 🎉 📄 Preprint available on arXiv Oct. 2025 📝 Excited to announce our paper \"An Empirical Study on Language Models for Generating Log Statements in Test Code\" is now published in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM).
