I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at POSTECH. I am leading Computer Security Lab. My research vision is to develop automated systems for analyzing safety-critical computer-based systems. In particular, I am deeply passionate about investigating and improving the security and robustness of Cyber-Physicsl Systems (CPS), which encompass practical systems such as drones, self-driving vehicles, robotic systems, and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. For prospective students I am looking for creative and ambitious students who are interested in general cybersecurity, cyber-physical systems, robotics, operating systems, hacking, and ML/AI. Please feel free to reach out to me via email with your CV and transcript.
