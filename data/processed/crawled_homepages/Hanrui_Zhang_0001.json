I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Prior to that, I: was a visiting faculty researcher at Google Research NYC, working with the OMEGA Market Algorithms team led by Vahab Mirrokni; was a postdoctoral fellow at Simons Laufer Mathematical Sciences Institute (SLMath, formerly MSRI), affiliated with UC Berkeley; got my PhD in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Vincent Conitzer; did my undergraduate in Yao Class, Tsinghua University, where I worked closely with Wei Chen and Pingzhong Tang. I am interested in Economics and Computation – problems with economic motivations that can be approached using techniques from computer science. My recent research focuses on learning and decision making in complex environments, in the presence of strategic behavior, with limited means of interaction, under uncertainty of the future. I also work extensively on mechanism / information design problems related to online platforms and data markets (here is a survey on ad auctions and autobidding that I coauthored during my time at Google). Technically, most of my research can be characterized as “applied theory”: I use tools (and sometimes craft new ones) in various branches of Theoretical Computer Science, Microeconomic Theory, and Machine Learning Theory to solve problems that are both practically motivated and mathematically well-defined. Accordingly, I publish in a wide range of venues, whose themes cover all these areas. I am constantly looking for students interested in developing algorithmic solutions for / theoretical understanding of problems with economic or social motivations. Applicants are expected to enjoy (and ideally, be good at) discovering and proving mathematical facts (because this constitutes 80%-100% of the research conducted in our group). Feel free to drop me an email if you are interested. (I try to be responsive, although that is becoming increasingly hard given the number of such inquiries.
