I received my master of Social and Economic Science from the University of Vienna in 1987 and my Ph.D. in 1990. Afterwards I joined the Knowledge-Based Systems Group at the Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence (OFAI) , as scientific researcher. I was a Postdoctoral Fellow within the Adaptive Intelligent Systems group of the Knowledge Systems Laboratory which in turn is part of the Computer Science Department at Stanford University CA, USA (August 1995 - August 1996, FWF-Erwin Schrödinger post-graduate fellowship). In October 1996, I joined the Institute of Software Technology and Interactive Systems (ISIS), Vienna University of Technology . From November 1999 to Febuary 2006, I was Associate University Professor. From 2006 to 2010 I was University Professor (Univ.Prof.) and head of the Department of Information and Knowledge Engineering at Danube University Krems, Austria. In April 2010 I moved back to the Institute at the Vienna University of Technology to establish the awarded Laura Bassi Centre of Expertise \"CVAST - Center for Visual Analytics Science and Technology\" funded by the Federal Ministry of Economy, Family and Youth of the Republic of Austria. (This initiative programme, the only one of its kind in Europe, is committed to equal opportunities and to establishing a new research culture to carry out applied basic research in the natural sciences, engineering and technology). As of April 1, 2015 (no joke ;-) ), I am Full University Professor (Visual Analytics) at Vienna University of TechnologyFrom April to September 2001 I was Visiting/Guest Professor at the Department of Simulation and Graphics, Faculty of Computer Science (FIN), Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg. From October 2001 to January 2002 I was Visiting/Guest Professor at the Johannes Kepler University Linz.From 1997 to 2006 I was chair of the Austrian Society for Artificial Intelligence (ÖGAI) and from 1998 to 2002 I was member (and vice-chair) of the board of the European Coordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence (ECCAI) .Our work has been recognized through a variety of awards: Best Paper Award at VIS Workshop vis4dh, 2019, Best Poster Award at IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST), 2015, Honorable Mention at IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST), 2012, third price winner at International Symposium on Graph Drawing and Network Visualization (GD) Creative Topic Challenge 2018 and 2019, Recognition of Service Award, Eurographics:European Association for Computer Graphics, 2012. Research InterestsVisualization & Visual AnalyticsInformation VisualizationInteraction DesignData Analysis Methods: Data Mining and Knowledge DiscoveryInformation Extraction and IntegrationKnowledge Crystallization ProcessesTemporal Representation and ReasoningTime-Oriented ModellingTemporal Data AbstractionPlan Management (Continual Plan Modeling)Data and Process ModelingWorkflow SystemsPlanning, Plan Execution, Plan Monitoring and EvaluationTask-oriented Design, Development, and Evaluation in Real-World Environments Bridging the Gap between Theory and PracticeGuideline- and Protocol-based Care: Design, Monitoring, and Therapy PlanningMedical Environments: (Neonatal) Intensive Care Units, Diabetes Management, Management of Hyperbilirubinemia/JaundiceBusiness IntelligenceMarket AnalysisOther disciplines of natural, social, and economic sciencesTeaching (partly in German)Courses administered in TISS PraktikaThemenlisteDiplomarbeitenThemenlisteCurrent ActivitiesMembership of Scientific Societies (Selection of the last 10 years)2023                IEEE VGTC Visualization Technical Award2020                Inducted into The IEEE VGTC Visualization Academy2018 –  2027   Member of EuroVis Steering Committee;
