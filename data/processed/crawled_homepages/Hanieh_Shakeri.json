At the intersection of Human Computer Interaction, Ubiquitous Computing, and Design Research, we are interested in exploring new models of technology design for the creation of calm computing systems that remain in the periphery of awareness and seamlessly integrate into existing routines. We especially look for pro-social applications and hope to create technology for social good.",
