Application of compiling techniques in the design of synthetic biology circuits. I am one of the Co-Investigators in the Warwick Integrative Synthetic Biology Centre (WISB).I am also a member of SBIDERLink opens in a new window, the Zeeman Institute for Systems Biology & Infectious Disease Epidemiology ResearchIn the area of Formal Methods, I am particularly interested in: Development of verified optimizing compilers; I have been working towards an approach to specifying optimisations based on Temporal Logics, which allows for many interesting optimisations to be written out formally and proved; Race conditions and their implications in the correct execution of concurrent programs and distributed applications. I am a member of the ACM-Women Scholarship committeeLink opens in a new window which provides funding for female students from anywhere in the world to attend CS conferences.
