Before joining SNU, I was a Research Scientist at Facebook AI Research (FAIR), Menlo Park. I finished my Ph.D. in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked with Yaser Sheikh. During my PhD, I interned at Facebook Reality Labs, Pittsburgh (Summer and Fall, 2017) and Disney Research Zurich (Summer, 2015). I received my M.S. in EE and B.S. in CS at KAIST, Korea. I am a recipient of the Samsung Scholarship and the CVPR Best Student Paper Award in 2018. NEW I am hiring research intern students. See more details here. Research The goal of my research is to endow machines and robots with the ability to perceive and understand human behaviors in 3D. Ultimately, I dream to build an AI system that can behave like humans in new environments and can interact with humans using a broad channel of nonverbal signals (kinesic signals or body languages). I pursue this direction by creating new tools in computer vision, machine learning, and computer graphics. The Panoptic Studio SNU ParaHome News Oct 2025 I was awarded the Okawa Research Grant Aug 2025 I will serve as an area chair for ICLR 2026, 3DV2026, and as a lead area chair for CVPR 2026 Aug 2025 I gave talks in Arirang TV: The Evolution of AI and AI: Reading Humans Jul 2025 I will be giving a talk in CORL 2025 workshop: Human to Robot (H2R) Jun 2025 I am co-organizing a RSS workshop on Dexterous Manipulation: Learning and Control with Diverse Data May 2025 I will be giving talks in CVPR 2025 workshops: Global 3D Human Poses Workshop, 3D Humans Workshop, and Agents in Interactions, from Humans to Robots Mar 2025 I will be giving a talk in an ICRA workshop: From Computer Vision-based Motion Tracking to Wearable Assistive Robot Control Jan 2025 I will serve as an area chair for CVPR 2025, ICCV 2025, and NeurIPS 2025 Aug 2024 The full version of ParaHome DB is now publicly available: [Code/Dataset].
