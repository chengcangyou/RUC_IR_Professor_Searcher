We develop approaches for extracting information about brain activity in health and disease by combining neuroimaging (fMRI, EEG) and computational signal analysis techniques. Our research is highly interdisciplinary and collaborative, bridging fields such as engineering, computer science, neuroscience, psychology, and medicine.We are at ​Vanderbilt University in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Department of Computer Science. We are also affiliated with the ﻿Department of Biomedical Engineering﻿, the Vanderbilt Lab for Immersive AI Translation (VALIANT), the Vanderbilt University Institute of Imaging Science (VUIIS), the Vanderbilt Institute for Surgery and Engineering (VISE), the Vanderbilt Brain Institute (VBI), and the Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center.  More information about our current research can be found here, and you can find our publications here.News2025: Congrats to Haatef for receiving an F31 Predoctoral Fellowship Award from NINDS! 🎊 2025: Congrats to Richard Song for receiving Highest Honors on his undergraduate Neuroscience thesis! 🎉2025: Mason Harding presents his EEG-fMRI work at ISBI 2025 in Houston!2025: Another successful and memorable  Brainhack Vanderbilt 🧠,  thanks to the vision and leadership of Roza Bayrak, Richard Song, and their entire team2024: Congrats to Haatef Pourmotabbed for receiving an Early Career Award at the Partners Against Mortality in Epilepsy (PAME) meeting at the American Epilepsy Society conference!2024: Welcome to Chang Li and Anna Machado, who join as Ph.D. students!2024: Welcome to Alex Douma, who joins us as a Research Assistant!2024: Our lab presents 7 scientific abstracts, an open-source software talk, and an educational workshop talk at OHBM 2024 in Seoul2024: Haatef and Sarah present at the American Society for Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery biennial meeting2024: Excited to work with our summer researchers Ella Provancher, Terra Lee, Ziyuan Xu, Ethan Edwards, and Runxuan Yu!2024: Kate Wang is named a 2024 Barry Goldwater Scholar 🎊 2024: Yamin Li is awarded first prize for her poster at ECE Day 🎉2024: Kim Rogge-Obando and Terra Lee present at the Society for Biological Psychiatry in Austin, TX2024: Shengchao Zhang and Sarah Goodale successfully defend their PhD dissertations!
