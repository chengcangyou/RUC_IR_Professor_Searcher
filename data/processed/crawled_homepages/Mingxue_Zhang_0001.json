My research interests include web security (e.g., program analysis for scripting languages, abnormal script detection, etc.) and software security (e.g., compliance analysis, vulnerability detection, etc.).I received my Ph.D. degree from the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2022, where I was fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Wei Meng. Prior to CUHK, I received my B.Eng in Computer Science and Technology from Wuhan University (Hongyi Talent Class) in 2018.RecruimentI am looking for mentally healthy, self-motivated, and smart Ph.D. and master students who have strong programming skills. You may find more information about our application and admission process here.💡 Please note that our group works on technically challenging problems. I would provide support and help whenever necessary. In the meanwhile, I expect the students to have solid background in computer science, be willing to learn, and be prepared to overcome challenges.💡 Also, we have several application cycles for both Ph.D. and master students, and we welcome undergraduate students who wish to publish at top-tier conferences to join us. However, we only have a few openings each year. Therefore, if you are interested, please contact me via email as early as possible.News[2025.07] Our paper on Android app unpacking has been accepted by TIFS![2025.06] Our paper on JavaScript engine fuzzing has been accepted by ICSE’26.
