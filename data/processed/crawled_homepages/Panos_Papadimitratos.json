In an increasingly interconnected world, we'd better be able to trust the systems we use and the information we get. That's basically what we are after with my Networked Systems Security (NSS) group. Our research agenda includes a gamut of security and privacy problems.  We have a strong systems character, implementing and evaluating our solutions. At the same time, we pay close attention to theoretical methods, including, notably, formal protocol analysis and information-theoretic results.
