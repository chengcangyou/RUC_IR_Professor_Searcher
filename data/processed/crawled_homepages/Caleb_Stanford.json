Iâm an assistant professor of computer science at the beautiful campus of UC Davis. I work on a number of topics (see research), broadly, on applications of programming languages and formal methods to problems in data processing, distributed systems, and computer security. Iâm a University of Pennsylvania PLClub alumni. My PhD advisor was Rajeev Alur. Requests Iâd love to hear from you! Please refer to the below depending on the type of request: Research positions: I have a limited number of open research positions at UC Davis. For undergraduate students, the best way to start out is to take a class from me and do well in it. For prospective PhD students: you will need to apply to UC Davis (in the fall) and list my name. Please send me an email if you have any questions! You might also want to check out this advice from Dave Doty. Peer review: Iâm very happy to review conference and journal papers. I will generally prioritize venues which feature open access proceedings and double blind review. Meetings: If you want to meet with me, please send me an email.",
