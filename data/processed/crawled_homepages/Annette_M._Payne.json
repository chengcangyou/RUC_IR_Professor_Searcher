I have since transferred to the Department of Computer Science as my interest in computational biology grew. I have now additional research interests in technology and computer assisted learning, and the use of technology to monitor and manage medical conditions. I have over 100 peer reviewed publications many of them can be found on my Research Gate profile at http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Annette_Payne/publications/?dbw=true These publications highly cited over 2000 times by other researchers (RG score of over 35 most months, and a ISI h-index of 31). I a Research Interest Score that is higher than 92% of researchers in my field. Qualifications BSc Hons.
