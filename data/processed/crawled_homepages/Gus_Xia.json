He is broadly interested in the design of interactive intelligent systems to extend human musical creation and expression. This research lies in the intersection of machine learning, HCI, robotics, and computer music. Some representative works include interactive composition via style transfer, human-computer interactive performances, autonomous dancing robots, large-scale content-based music retrieval, haptic guidance for flute tutoring, and bio-music computing using slime mold. Email Share Prior to joining MBZUAI, Professor Xia received his Ph.D. in the machine learning department at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in 2016, and he was a Neukom Fellow at Dartmouth from 2016 to 2017. Professor Xia is a Global Network Assistant Professor in Computer Science at New York University, Shanghai. He also holds affiliations at Tandon, CILVR at the Center for Data Science, and MARL at Steinhardt. Professor Xia is also a professional Di and Xiao (Chinese flute and vertical flute) player. He plays as a soloist in the NYU Shanghai Jazz ensemble, Pitt Carpathian Ensemble, and Chinese Music Institute of Peking University.

To “understand” means to learn the musical representation conveyed through sounds, performances, and symbolic compositions. To “extend” means to use such an understanding to create artificial music partners, serving music lovers at all levels. Wang, D. Xu, G. Xia, Y.
