He submitted for his PhD at MIT on distributed and private computation. He is the president of IntegrityDistributed, a research based non-profit that he co-founded with a focus on anti-corruption and financial compliance. Professor Vepakomma's research focuses on developing algorithms for distributed computation in statistics and machine learning under constraints of privacy and efficiency. He won the ADIA Lab Fellowship, Meta PhD research fellowship in Applied Statistics, two SERC Scholarships (for Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing) from MIT's Schwarzman college of computing. His non-profit won the Financial Times Digital Innovation Award. He won a Best Student Paper Award at FL-IJCAI, a Baidu Best Paper Award at NeurIPS-SpicyFL and a Best Paper Runner Up Award at FG-2021. Professor Vepakomma's technical work is inspired by foundations of non-asymptotic statistics, randomized algorithms, learning augmented algorithms, combinatorics, and at times just by systems design. He has organized several workshops at ICLR, ICML, IJCAI, CVPR and NeurIPS.
