My research work focuses on applied cryptography and increasingly on the intersection of cryptography and formal methods. I have particuraly focused on the security of deployed electronic voting systems. I currently have several funded PhD positions avaliable on the intersection of cryptography and formal methods; the positions are part of a larger project which aims to ensure that e-government, e-health, e-commerce and e-voting are secure and trustworthy by inventing new ways to verify these systems without infringing privacy. The project expects to use innovative techniques from cryptography to support development of trustworthy systems. Biography I obtained my PhD degree, which focused on secure computation from cryptography, from the Queensland University of Technology in 2017. After completing my PhD, I was a research and development manager at Polyas GmbH where I researched, developed and implemented cryptographic voting systems. In 2019 I joined the Norwegian University of Science and Technology as a Postdoc. I joined ANU in 2021. Activities & Awards bars search times",
