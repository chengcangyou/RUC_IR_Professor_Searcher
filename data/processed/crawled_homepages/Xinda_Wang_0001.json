I received my Ph.D. degree from George Mason University in 2023, advised by Dr. Kun Sun at the Center of Secure Information System and honored with Outstanding Dissertation Award. My research interest is software security, with a focus on applying machine/deep learning for vulnerability detection, patch management, program analysis, etc. I am also interested in AI security and systems security. News[09/2025] Two papers titled \"MAVUL: Multi-Agent Vulnerability Detection via Contextual Reasoning and Interactive Refinement\" and \"NatGVD: Natural Adversarial Example Attack towards Graph-based Vulnerability Detection\" accepted by TPS 2025. Congrats to Youpeng, Avilash, and Weiliang![09/2025] Invited to serve in the TPC for CCS 2026.[09/2025] Our vulnerability and patch datasets (D0V, PatchDB) are selected by Google DeepMind to evaluate Gemini 1.5 and by NSF as 1 of 10 datasets for integration into NAIRR Pilot to power AI literacy, education, and innovation. [08/2025] One paper \"VPGFUZZ: Vulnerable Path-Guided Greybox Fuzzing\" accepted by TIFS.[07/2025] Our proposal on \"An Infrastructure and Dataset for Research in Software Vulnerability Detection and Remediation\" is funded by NSF CIRC Planning-C Program (Lead PI). Thanks NSF![04/2025] Led a group of 11 female students and faculty members to the Women in Cybersecurity (WiCyS) conference.
