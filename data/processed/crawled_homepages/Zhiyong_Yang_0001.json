I’m Zhiyong Yang(杨智勇), an Associate Professor (Tenure-track Assistant Professor) with the School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. I got my Ph.D. degree from Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IIE, CAS) in 2021, supervised by Prof. Qingming Huang (IEEE Fellow). I am also lucky to have opportunities to collaborate with Qianqian Xu (Professor at ICT CAS), Xiaochun Cao (Professor at Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen Compus, China), Yuan Yao (Professor at HKUST), Jiechao Xiong (Research Fellow at Tencent Lab AI Lab), Yuan Su (Senior Researcher at Microsoft Quantum), Ke Ma (postdoc at UCAS), Yangbangyan Jiang (Ph.D. Student at IIE, CAS), and Jingcheng Lu (Computer Science graduate student at UC Irvine). I’m especially interested in several fundamental problems in machine learning: Decision Invariant Optimization (Xcurve Framework) Trustworthy Machine Learning Long-tail Learning I’m always looking for highly self-motivated PhD/Master students!
