His research focuses on software code quality, refactoring, sustainable AI, and machine learning for software engineering (ML4SE). He earned his PhD in Software Engineering from the Athens University of Economics and Business, Greece, in 2019, and an MS in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of TechnologyâMadras, India. Before joining academia, he worked with Siemens in the USA (2019â2021) and India (2008â2015), gaining extensive research-oriented industry experience. Tushar is the co-author of Refactoring for Software Design Smells: Managing Technical Debt and two Oracle Java certification books. He is also the founder of Designite, a widely used software design quality assessment tool. He is a Senior Member of IEEE. He can be reached at tushar@dal.ca.
