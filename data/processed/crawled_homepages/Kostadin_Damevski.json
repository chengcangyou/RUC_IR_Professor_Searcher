For instance, my research has focused on helping developers locate the code needed to fix a specific bug and to improve how developers search for relevant documentation on the Web. I'm also interested in cybersecurity, i.e., writing secure code, and end-user programming. At VCU, I co-lead the Software Engineering Center. A lot more details about what I do are on my vita. I'm actively looking for collaborations with industry and motivated graduate and undergraduate students to join my research group. Please contact me if you are interested.",
