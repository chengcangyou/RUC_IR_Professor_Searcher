I obtained Ph.D. degree as an Outstanding Doctoral Student in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech in 2017. My research spans machine learning and artificial intelligence for complex data including networks, spatial, temporal, and textual data. I have authored over two hundred papers in top-tier venues such as KDD, NeurIPS, ICLR, AAAI, and IJCAI. Our research is generously supported by federal agencies such as NSF (CAREER, III, IIBR, CRII, IUCRC, etc.), NIH, and industrial sponsors such as Amazon, Meta, Merck, NVidia, Cisco, NEC Lab, Oracle, and Bank of America.
