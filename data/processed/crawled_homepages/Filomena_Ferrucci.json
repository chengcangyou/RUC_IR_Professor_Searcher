Since they are fundamental for decision support in many application contexts, recently a lot of interest has arisen toward data-mining techniques to filter out relevant subsets of very large data repositories as well as visualization tools to effectively display the results. In this paper we propose a data-mining system to deal with very large spatio-temporal data sets. Within this system, new techniques have been developed to efficiently support the data-mining process, address the spatial and temporal dimensions of the data set, and visualize and interpret results. In particular, two complementary 3D visualization environments have been implemented. One exploits Google Earth to display the mining outcomes combined with a map and other geographical layers, while the other is a Java3Dbased tool for providing advanced interactions with the data set in a non-geo-referenced space, such as displaying association rules and variable distributions. rarrow_back_iosarrow_forward_iosDownload Adding symbolic information to picture models: definitions and propertiesTheoretical Computer Science, 2005In the paper we propose extensions of some picture models, such as colored, drawn and pixel pictu... more In the paper we propose extensions of some picture models, such as colored, drawn and pixel pictures. Such extensions are conceived by observing that a picture may embed more information than the shape, such as colors, labels, etc., which can be represented by a symbol from an alphabet and can be associated to segments, points or pixels. New interesting issues derived from the introduction of symbols will be investigated together with some complexity and decidability questions for the proposed extensions.Download Exploiting Visual Languages in Software Engineering... of icons and diagrams to convey information and to allow for multimodal communication and ...... more ... of icons and diagrams to convey information and to allow for multimodal communication and ...

The effectiveness of visual languages require that some efforts must be accomplished to obtain efficient parsing techniques. A general parsing scheme for relation grammars is presented. The class RG/1 of grammars is characterized which seems to be well suited for modelling visual languages of practical use. An efficient O(n log n) parsing algorithm is also givenDownload Scorm run-time environment as a serviceStandardization efforts in e-learning are aimed at achieving interoperability among Learning Mana... more Standardization efforts in e-learning are aimed at achieving interoperability among Learning Management Systems (LMSs) and Learning Object (LO) authoring tools. Some of the specifications produced have reached quite a good maturity level and have been adopted in software systems. Some others, such as SCORM Run-Time Environment (RTE), have not reached the same success, probably due to their intrinsic difficulty in being understood adequately and implemented properly. The SCORM RTE defines a set of functionalities which allow LOs to be launched in the LMS and to exchange data with it. Its adoption is crucial in the achievement of full interoperability among LMSs and LO authoring tools. In order to boost the adoption of SCORM RTE in LMSs, we propose a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)based reference model for offering the SCORM RTE functionalities as a service, external to the LMS. By externalizing functionalities from LMSs, our model encourages the independent development of e-learning system components, allowing elearning software producers to gain several benefits, such as better software re-use and easier integration and complexity management, with a consequent cost reduction. The proposed model is validated through a prototype system, in which a popular LMS, developed with PHP language, is enhanced with the support of SCORM RTE functionalities, provided by an external Web service based on Java technology. data with the LMS server. In practice, the API Instance works as a broker between the SCO and the LMS, since the former lacks the capability to connect with the LMS server directly, due to its nature of a plain document readable through a Web browser.Download Integrating Google Earth within OLAP Tools for Multidimensional Exploration and Analysis of Spatial DataSpatial OnLine Analytical Processing solutions are a type of Business Information Tool meant to s... more Spatial OnLine Analytical Processing solutions are a type of Business Information Tool meant to support a Decision Maker in extracting hidden knowledge from data warehouses containing spatial data. To date, very few SOLAP tools are available, each presenting some drawbacks reducing their flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a web-based SOLAP tool, obtained by suitably integrating into an ad-hoc architecture the Geobrowser Google Earth with a freely available OLAP engine, namely Mondrian. As a consequence, a Decision Maker can perform exploration and analysis of spatial data both through the Geobrowser and a Pivot Table in a seamlessly fashion. In this paper, we illustrate the main features of the system we have developed, together with the underlying architecture, using a simulated case study.

By using XML as notation, GXL provides a scaleable and versatile approach to facilitate interoperability of reengineering tools. In this paper we propose a methodology to generate visual programming environments, which use GXL as data exchange format for visual languages. The methodology is conceived to be supported by grammar-based tools for the automatic generation of visual languages. In particular, we ...

The system can be used for evaluating learner's knowledge by means of multiple choice questions. Its use is suitable within the academic environment in order to improve a blended learning approach by providing tutors with an additional assessment tool, and learners with a distance self-assessment means. In the paper, the main characteristics of the tool are presented together with a rationale behind them and an outline of the architectural design of the system. A",
