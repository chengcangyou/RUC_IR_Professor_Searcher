Recently, he has been involved in developing GFlowNets, a new class of generative models of compositional objects, that find direct applications in speeding up the scientific discovery process, both from a theoretical side and through an open-source library. More generally, he is interested in understanding the mechanisms behind intelligence, be it human or artificial. Email Share Prior to joining MBZUAI, Professor Lahlou was a senior researcher at the Technology Innovation Institute in Abu Dhabi, scientist in residence at NextAI in Montreal and intern at Google and IBM. He obtained a Ph.D. in uncertainty modeling from Université de Montreal, a master’s degree in mathematics, vision and learning from Ecole Normale Supérieure and graduated with very high honors from his master’s degrees in applied mathematics at Ecole Polytechnique. Before his Ph.D., he worked as a data scientist at Booking.com in Amsterdam.
