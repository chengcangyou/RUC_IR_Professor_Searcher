Also, I am an Associate Editor for Physical Review E. I was a \"RamÃ³n y Cajal\" senior researcher at university Rovira i Virgili, a postdoctoral researcher in the Amaral Lab at Northwestern University, and a research specialist at ISI Foundation. I have a PhD in Physics from Jacobs University, and a MS in Physics from University of Rome Tor Vergata. My main area of research is network science.
