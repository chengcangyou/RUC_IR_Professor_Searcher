I was awarded the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science by the University of Oxford in 2020, where I was supervised by Prof. Leslie Ann Goldberg and Prof. Andreas Galanis. I was a member of St. Hugh's College at Oxford, and also a Clarendon scholar, fully-funded by the Clarendon Scholarship from 2015 to 2019. Before coming to Oxford, I obtained my bachelor degree in Computer Science from Zhiyuan College at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China. I am interested in many aspects of theoretical computer science, discrete probability and combinatorics. Currently I mainly work on designing and analysing approximation algorithms for counting and sampling problems. I am looking for Ph.D. students who are interested in combinatorics and theoretical computer science.",
