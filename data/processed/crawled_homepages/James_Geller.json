He served as Associate Dean for Research of the Ying Wu College of Computing at NJIT from 2015 to 2020. He received his PhD from the State University of New York at Buffalo in 1988 in Computer Science, with a focus on Artificial Intelligence/Knowledge Representation. Dr. Geller cofounded SABOC (the Structural Analysis of Biomedical Ontologies Center) at the Department of Computer Science at NJIT. He has published over 230 journal and conference papers and 14 book chapters in Medical Informatics, Semantic Web Technology, Object-Oriented Database Modeling, Knowledge Representation, etc. Between 2006 and 2012 Dr. Geller was Co-Principal Investigator on several federal grants from NIH, totaling over $2,500,000, on auditing methods, abstraction algorithms and software tools for important medical terminology systems such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine – Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT). From 2012-2015 he was co-PI on an NSF grant for teaching Cyber Security (iSECURE). From 2014 to 2019 he was co-PI on a major NIH grant on family-based quality assurance for Biomedical Ontologies. Subsequently he was co-PI on an NSF grant on \"Increasing Urban Youth Participation in Computing through Mentorship and Coding Resources.\" Currently he is a co-PI on an S-STEM grant: Applying Student Knowledge for Success in Cybersecurity and Data Science. He is also an investigator on the NJ ACTS program:1/6 NJ ACTS: A Platform for Translational Science in New Jersey. Dr. Geller is a founding participant of the BRAID Consortium of Harvey Mudd College and is actively involved in bringing women and minorities into the computing field. He has founded the NJIT WiCS, G-WiCS, and HACCS clubs for Women/Hispanics in Computing. In 2012 Dr. Geller was inducted as a Fellow of the American College of Medical Informatics (ACMI). Dr. Geller received the NJIT Master Teacher Designation (2005) and three other NJIT teaching awards in 2002, 2003 and 2011. Dr. Geller also received an NJIT College Research Award (2010). In September 2020 Dr. Geller received the NJIT Constance A. Murray Award for Advancing Diversity. In Fall 2024 Dr. Geller received the Robert W. Van Houten Award for Teaching Excellence. This award is granted by the NJIT Alumni Association. Awardees cannot \"apply\" for it. Partial (overlapping) lists of Dr. Geller's publications can be found at: https://dblp.org/search?q=james.geller:&qp=H1.99:W1.1:F1.4:F2.4:F3.4:F4.2 https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=R_EbDzYAAAAJ&hl=en https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/myncbi/james.geller.1/bibliography/public/ And now for something lighter: Geller's law of gravity: If something is on the floor it cannot fall down. Geller's law of interpersonal physics: If you throw a stone in the water the waves will make you wet. My advisor Stuart Shapiro, taught me that \"If you did not write it down, it did not happen.\" I feel this rule should be extended. Geller's first rule of epistemological ontology: If you did not take a picture of it, it did not happen. Geller's second rule of epistemological ontology: If you took a picture of it and did not post it on facebook/instagram/etc. it still did not happen. Geller's third rule of epistemological ontology: If you did not make a video of it and post it on YouTube it still did not happen.",
