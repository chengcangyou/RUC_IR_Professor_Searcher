I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, and a member of INESC-ID, where I conduct my research as a member of the SAT group. My goal, both as a researcher and as an educator, is to contribute to the effort to embed formal methods into the heart of the software development process, grounding it on well-established mathematical principles and certified analyses and tools. So far, I have been mainly focused on Web programs written in JavaScript. At Imperial, I led the development of JaVerT, the first separation-logic-based tool for JavaScript analysis and testing. The JaVerT project has been highly successful thus far, gathering interest from researchers in both industry and academia. JaVerT was awarded a FB research award and the JaVerT team is currently working with R&D engineers at Amazon, using JaVerT to verify critical components of the JavaScript implementation of the AWS Encryption SDK.
