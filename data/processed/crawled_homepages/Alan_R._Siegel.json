The current topics include technical articles plus two closely related publications about mathematics education and the TIMSS Videotape of Classroom Study of teaching in Japan, Germany, and the U.S. The technical publications include work in the areas of plane geometry, probability (medians and Heoffding bounds), the mathematical analysis of closed hashing, and the theory of fast hash functions. Education Understanding and misunderstanding the Third International Mathematics and Science Study: what is at stake and why K-12 education studies matter, Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM2006), Volume III: Invited Lectures, M. Sanz-Sole, J. Soria, L.L. Varona, and J. Verdera, Ed., pp. 1599--1630 (2006). Telling Lessons from the TIMSS Videotape. (The paper is here.) This analysis of the TIMSS video tape and the ensuing studies is written to let you decide for yourself what made the teaching so special. But don't take my word for it; read the paper and do your own thinking. If you still have doubts, go review the tapes and check out the references. After all, that's what I did. This paper appeared as Chapter 5 in Testing Student Learning, Evaluating Teaching Effectiveness, Williamson Evers and Herbert Walberg, Ed. pp. 161--193 (2004).

Area in the plane We resolve a number of area optimization questions about polygons and related figures.  Some of the problems have a history that goes back 10, 30 and even 50 years.  The first proof is not new. The paper is intended to give an entertaining and intuitive proof of the isoperimetric inequality in the plane. The idea originates with Lawler. Simple polygons (i.e., polygons that do not intersect themselves). A naive proof of the 2-D Isoperimetric Theorem in Elementary Geometry. An isoperimetric theorem in plane geometry. Self-intersecting polygons. An isoperimetric inequality for self-intersecting polygons. Arrangements of segments and the area they encompass. A Dido Problem as modernized by Fejes T�th. Some Dido-type Inequalities. Open problems. Performance analyses for closed hashing in a model that supports real computation For closed hashing,  performance estimates are normally based on simplified analyses of idealized programs that cannot be implemented.  We show that the same results can be achieved for programmable hash functions that run in constant time---provided certain caching resources are available. The performance of closed hashing with limited randomness. Double Hashing is Computable and Randomizable with Universal Hash Functions, with J.P. Schmidt. Closed Hashing is Computable and Optimally Randomizable with Universal Hash Functions, with J.P. Schmidt. The theory of fast hash functions. On Universal Classes of Extremely Random Constant Time Hash Functions and their Time-Space Tradeoff. Probability Medians of discrete random variables Median bounds and their application. While tail estimates have received significant attention in the probability, statistics, discrete mathematics, and computer science literature, the same cannot be said for medians of probability distributions, and for good reason. First, there are only a few published results in this area, and even they are not at all well known (but should be). Second, there seems to be very little mathematical machinery for determining the medians of probability distributions. Third (and consequently), median estimates have not been commonly used in the analysis of algorithms, apart from the kinds of analyses frequently used for Quicksort, and the provably good median approximation schemes typified by efficient selection algorithms. This paper addresses these issues in the following ways. First, a beginning framework is presented for establishing median estimates. It is strong enough to prove, as simple corollaries, the two or three non-trivial median bounds (not so readily identified) in the literature. Second, several new median results are presented, which are all, apart from one, derived via this framework. Third, applications are offered: median estimates are shown to simplify the analysis of a variety of probabilistic algorithms and processes. Chernoff-Hoefding bounds (new material plus handbook-like coverage) Toward a Usable Theory of Chernoff Bounds for Heterogeneous and Partially Dependent Random Variables. (The paper is here.) Let X be a sum of real valued random variables and have a bounded mean E[X]. The generic Chernoff-Hoeffding estimate for large deviations of X is: Prob{X-E[X]>a} < min{l>0}e(-l(a+E[X]))E[el X], which applies with a > 0 to random variables with very small tails. At issue is how to use this method to attain sharp and useful estimates. We present a number of Chernoff-Hoeffding bounds for sums of random variables that can have a variety of dependent relationships and that might be heterogeneously distributed. Chernoff-Hoeffding Bounds for Applications with Limited Independence (The paper is here.) with J.P. Schmidt and A. Srinivassan. It is all in the title: your favorite tail estimates for sums of random variables that only exhibit limited independence, such as those produced by implementations of hash functions for computers. Detailed summaries Area in the plane We resolve some area optimization questions about polygons and related figures.  The first paper presents a known proof of a classical isoperimetric inequality for the circle. The inequality states that among all regions in the plane with a given perimeter, the disk has the greatest area. There is a related result for polygons, which states that among all polygonal regions with a given set of side lengths, those whose vertices lie on a circle have the greatest area. As the ancient Greek geometers knew very well, this fact is readily derived from the isoperimetric inequality for the circle. But as has been noted by the Russian geometer Yaglom, a direct Euclidean proof of this basic fact about polygons has been missing. The second paper below presents a Euclidean construction that establishes this inequality directly. Let P and Q be n-sided polygonal regions with the same side lengths, and suppose that the vertices of Q lie on a circle. The algorithm partitions Q into 2n pieces that are then rearranged to cover all of P (with possible overlaps and other excesses). It follows that the area of Q is at least as large as that of P. Simple polygons (i.e., polygons that do not intersect themselves). A naive proof of the 2-D Isoperimetric Theorem in Elementary Geometry. (The paper is here.) We offer a completely elementary proof of the following basic fact: Among all regions in the plane with a given perimeter p, the circle has the greatest area. Direct and to the point: no compactness, no calculus, no errors. A brief history of the problem is included, along with a discussion about Steiner and why his approach requires a compactness argument. An isoperimetric theorem in plane geometry. (The paper is here.) Cool applet demo (Back to Area Hashing Medians) We give a new and substantial generalization of A .  The naive global analysis of A is extended to derive the following covering property:  Imagine walking along the consecutive edges of a simple but not necessarily convex polygon P and drawing a ray from each vertex. Suppose you circulate about P in a clockwise direction, and pick a new direction for each ray that represents a clockwise rotation of the preceding ray. Suppose the sum of all rotational increments adds up to 360o. Whenever the rays from two consecutive vertices intersect, let them induce the triangular region defined by the two vertices and the point of intersection. We show there is a fixed a such that if each ray is rotated by a, then the triangular regions induced by the redirected rays cover the interior of P. This covering implies the standard isoperimetric inequalities in two dimensions, as well several new inequalities. The proof is technically elementary, since it does not even use calculus.  Unfortunately, a correct proof is non-trivial, and the applications use a little more math. Self-intersecting polygons. An isoperimetric inequality for self-intersecting polygons. (The paper is here.) (Back to Area Hashing Medians) The following has been the subject of incremental improvements over a course of 50 years. Take a self-intersecting polygon P, and consider the bounded components of the plane when the polygonal path P is removed (i.e., R2 / P). For each such component, we have, for example: Its area, and the area of its convex hull. Various notions of how may times the curve P winds around the component. The problem is to establish as strong a bound as possible where the smaller side comprises an expression built from the values described in i. and ii. above, and the upper bound is the area of one of the following: The circle with the same perimeter as P. A polygon that is inscribed in a circle and has sides with the same lengths as P. A polygon that is simple, convex, and is built from a rearrangement of the edges in P, where only translations (and no rotations) are used. Let P be a non-simple polygon in R2 with segments that are directed by a traversal along its vertices. Let E be the collection of located directed segments of P, but with some segments split into",
