I completed my postdoctoral training at UC Berkeley (working with Pieter Abbeel) and PhD at KAIST (advised by Jinwoo Shin). During PhD, I also interned and collaborated closely with Honglak Lee at University of Michigan. Publications (C: conference / J: journal / P: preprint / *: equal contribution / ^: equal advising)2026[C65] Unintended Misalignment from Agentic Fine-Tuning: Risks and Mitigation [pdf]Dongyoon Hahm*, Taywon Min*, Woogyeol Jin*, Kimin LeeAAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) AI Alignment Track 2026[C64] MobileSafetyBench: Evaluating Safety of Autonomous Agents in Mobile Device Control [pdf][code][site]Juyong Lee*, Dongyoon Hahm*, June Suk Choi*, W.
