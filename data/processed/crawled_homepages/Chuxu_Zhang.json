About I have been an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of Connecticut since 2024. My research interests center around AI, machine learning, and data science. Recently, I have focused on developing foundational, resource-efficient, and safe machine learning algorithms and models, particularly on graph, text, and science data. Besides, I apply them to applications in various domains including healthcare, social media, science, knowledge and information systems, recommender systems, and natural language processing. My works are published in top conferences and journals of AI, machine learning, and data science. I direct the Machine Intelligence and Data Science (MINDS) Lab. I have received some awards and honors such as IJCAI Early Career Spotlight (2025), ICBS Frontiers of Science Award (2024), and NSF CAREER Award (2024). Besides, my work won several Best Paper Awards or nominations in leading conferences. Before joining UConn, I was an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the Brandeis University (2020-2024). I completed my PhD study in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame (2017-2020). Publications Here are some of my recent papers.
