Openings 📢 Funded [Thesis-Based Master's|PhD's]: I plan to recruit at most one more [Thesis-Based Master's|PhD's] student for Sep 2026 admission. If your research passion lies in the intersection of computer hardware and software AND you have programming experience in C/C++/Rust, please email me with your CV (including GitHub and Google Scholar, if applicable), transcripts, and research statement (no more than 2 pages). Please make sure the subject line starts with [UofC Application], otherwise no reply should be expected. 📢 UofC Undergrad Research Projects (CPSC 502/503): If you wish to enroll in a research course (subject to eligibility), please contact me via email for more information well in advance of the start of the term. Research I lead Data Systems and Infrastructure Lab (DSIL) at the University of Calgary. My research interests are mainly focused on database engines, transaction processing, data storage management, resource disaggregation, and modern hardware for database systems. My papers were published in top-tier data management venues like SIGMOD, VLDB, and CIDR. I also serve as a program committee member for premier data management research and systems research conferences, including SIGMOD, VLDB, ICDE, and EuroSys.
