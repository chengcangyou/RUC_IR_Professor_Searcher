My research explores the intersection of language, cognition and computation. Natural language utilizes a finite vocabulary to express an infinite array of ideas. I investigate how we adapt the lexicon to convey emerging meanings spontaneously or over longer time periods. In particular, I have been studying how words extend or combine to derive new meanings and the extent to which computational models can replicate these processes to construct and interpret novel word meanings. In a related line of work, I have been involved in projects that examine crosslinguistic structures. I also develop computational methods for exploring the relations of language with other domains such as morality. Lexicon development and evolution Fishkin, M., Chang, S., and Xu, Y.
