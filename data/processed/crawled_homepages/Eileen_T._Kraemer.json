Tycho Howle Director of the School of Computing in the summer of 2014. In the spring of 2018 she transitioned to the role of grad coordinator for the HCC PhD program, a position now held by Dr. Kelly Caine. Since 2020, Dr. Kraemer has focused on developing and teaching the MSCS Ready sequence of courses, through which students with an undergraduate degree in another discipline can prepare to earn a master's degree in computer science. Prior to her time at Clemson, she served as Professor of Computer Science and Associate Dean of the Franklin College of Arts & Sciences at the University of Georgia. Kraemerâs research focuses on the intersection of humans and technology, with two major thrusts: human aspects of software development (CS education and software engineering) and human aspects of bioinformatics (design of tools and user interfaces for bioinformatics). Recent publications include: Fostering program comprehension in novice programmers-learning activities and learning trajectories Qualitative observations of student reasoning: Coding in the wild Social Effects of Pair Programming Mitigate Impact of Bounded Rationality A Spirit of Camaraderie: The Impact of Pair Programming on Retention Programming with Concurrency: Threads, Actors, and Coroutines Characterizing Comprehension of Concurrency Concepts Debugging Concurrent Software: A Study Using Multithreaded Sequence Diagrams Clemson University School of Computing | Office: 312 McAdams Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 | 864.656.5874 | etkraem@clemson.edu",
