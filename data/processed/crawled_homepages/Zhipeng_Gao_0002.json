Zhipeng Gao 高 志 鹏 Shanghai Institute for Advanced Study of Zhejiang University • #38, Zheda Road, Yuquan Campus, Zhejiang University • ZJU HOMEPAGE zhipeng.gao AT zju.edu.cn • CV • Google Scholar • GitHub I have joined the Shanghai Institute for Advanced Study of Zhejiang University (SIAS) as an Assistant Professor (ZJU100 Young Professor). Before that, I recieved my Ph.D at MSF, Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University. I was very fortunate to work under the supervision Prof. John Grundy and Dr. Xin Xia during my Ph.D studies. Before starting my Ph.D, I worked as a research engineer under the supervision of Prof. Lingxiao Jiang and Prof. David Lo in Singapore Management University. My research interests include software engineering, blockchain technology, data mining, and deep learning, particularly in mining software repositories, search based software engineering, recommender systems. I will be looking for students interested in working on intelligent software engineering and related topics. 目前课题组仍有少量研究生名额，欢迎有保研意向的同学与我们联系!(zhipeng.gao@zju.edu.cn) Education Monash University Ph.D. in Software Engineering September 2018 - February 2022, Austrilia Advisor: Prof. John Grundy Co-Advisor: Dr. Xin Xia and Prof. Aldeida Aleti University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) Master in Software Engineering September 2014 - June 2017, China Advisor: Prof. Yong Ye Mentor: Prof. Liqiang Nie Hangzhou Dianzi University (HDU) Bachelor in Electronic Engineering September 2010 - June 2014, China Experiences Research Intern, Huawei, Hangzhou, China, May 2020 - March 2022 Advisior: Dr. Xin Xia and Prof. Weiyi Shang Research Engineer, Singapore Management University, Singapore, April 2018 - September 2018 Advisior: Prof. Lingxiao Jiang and Prof. David Lo Research Intern, Fuji Xerox, Yokohama, Japan, October 2016 - August 2017 Advisior: Dr. Roshan Thapliya Visiting Student, National University of Singapore, Singapore, August 2015 - May 2016 Advisior: Prof. Liqiang Nie Publications Google Scholar In the Year of 2026: pdf Actionable Warning Is Not Enough: Recommending Valid Actionable Warnings with Weak Supervision Zhipeng Xue, Zhipeng Gao*, Tongtong Xu, Xing Hu, Xin Xia, Shanping Li.
