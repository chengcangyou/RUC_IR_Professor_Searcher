My focus has been in the classical and quantum complexity of Boolean functions (including property testing, sensitivity and block sensitivity of Boolean functions and quantum database search), in electronic commerce, in graph algorithms and in coding theory. My Curriculum Vitae [ps], [pdf]. My complete list of papers can be found in my \"Publications Page\". The list of my courses and the links to the course course webpages can be found in my \"Course Page\". SOME HONORS I HAVE RECEIVED: - Our work on Streaming caught the attention and got the praise of Donald E. Knuth. [The article] - Our work on Conditional Sampling and our work on Huge-Object Model got into the Oded Goldreich's \"my choices\" list. - The function I discovered in my early work on Sensitivity Conjecture has been given my name.",
