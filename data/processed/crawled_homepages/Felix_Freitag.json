I am part of the Distributed Systems Group. I participate in a number of research and development projects including: Â· LoRaMesher: Library for deploying LoRa mesh networks on IoT nodes. Â· Federated Learning at the Tiny Edge: Developing federated machine learning for microcontroller boards. Other projects that I've been involved with in the past include: Â· LeadingEdge â Holistic and foundational resource allocation framework for optimized and impactful edge computing services. 2020-2023. Â· DiPET - Distributed Stream Processing on Fog and Edge Systems via Transprecise Computing. 2020-2023. Â· Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate in Distributed Computing EMJD-DC (2012-2020). Â· Cloudy: Cloudy is a distribution based on Debian GNU/Linux, aimed at end users, to foster the adoption of hosting cloud-based services in community network clouds. Â· LightKone: A Horizon2020 research project on lightweight computation for networks at the edge. 2017-2019. Â· netCommons: A Horizon2020 research project in the CAPS area, which proposes a novel transdisciplinary methodology on promoting and supporting the creation of network infrastructures as commons. 2016-2018. Â· Fed4FIRE: A FP7 research project in the FIRE area, which federates the testbeds developed in individual FIRE projects. UPC has made C-Lab available to Fed4FIRE, which was developed in the CONFINE project. Â· National research project Community Networks and Clouds (TIN2013-47245-C2-1-R) (2014-2016). Â· Scientific coordination of the FP7 FIRE EU CLOMMUNITY project addressing the obstacles for communities of citizens in bootstrapping, running and expanding community-owned networks that provide community services organised as community clouds (2013-2015). Â· FP7 FIRE EU Large-scale integrating project (IP) CONFINE on \"Community Networks Testbed for the Future Internet\" (10/2011-9/2015). Â· National research project Delfin: Self-adapting distributed systems for the Future Internet (TIN2010-20140-C03-01). Â· FP6 Grid4All: Grid4All aims at enabling domestic users, non-profit organisations such as schools, and small enterprises, to share their resources and to access massive Grid resources when needed, envisioning a future in which access to resources is democratised, readily available, cooperative, and inexpensive (2006-2009). Â· FP6 SORMA: Development of methods and tools for an efficient market-based allocation of resources, through a self-organizing resource management system, using market-driven models supported by extensions for Grid infrastructures. IST European Project (2006-2009). Â· P2PGrid: A national integrated project on several aspects of large scale systems. Â· FP6 Catnets: Evaluation of the Catallaxy paradigm for decentralized operation of dynamic application networks. FET IST European Project (2004-2007). Â· Scientific coordination of FET FP5 Catnet: Catallactic mechanisms for the deployment of application networks on the Internet. (3/2002-3/2003) Â· CRAC: ComparticiÃ³n de Recursos para Aprendizaje Cooperativo (also known as GPPMCLE: Grid and Peer-to-Peer Middleware for Cooperative Learning Environments). MCYT National project (UPC, UOC, UVA) (2002-2005). Â· Cosaco: Components for Cooperative Learning. CICYT National project (UVA, UPC) (2001-2003). Teaching Courses I am currently teaching: Â· Information Technologies Project - a Bachelor-level project-based course (Bachelor Degree in Computing Engineering) on information technologies. Â· Computer Networks - a Bachelor-level course (Bachelor Degree in Computing Engineering) on computer networks. Â· Decentralized Systems - a Master-level course (Master in Innovation and Research in Informatics) on distributed, decentralized, scalable systems. Ph.D. Students I work with the following graduate students: (PhD. students with accepted Thesis project) Â· Roger Pueyo, co-supervised with Roc Messeguer. Former students (with PhD. degree): Â· Nuno ApÃ³lonia (EMJD-DC), 2018, On Service Optimization in Community Network Micro-Clouds, co-supervised with Leandro Navarro and Sarunas Girdzijauskas (KTH).
