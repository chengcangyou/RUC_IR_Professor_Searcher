If an individual is not listed in College Directory they will not be listed in the directory used by Imperial College's switchboard either, therefore switchboard will not be able to connect you. Students are not listed in the directory used by the switchboard either so they will be unable to connect you. If the entry above does not have a telephone number listed then Switchboard will not have that person listed. If the entry does not have a telephone number listed, but there is an email address listed we recommend you email them as it is possible that they do not have a telephone line.
