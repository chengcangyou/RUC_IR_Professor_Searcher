I am the founding director of Machine Perception Lab. Before joining Wayne State University in 01/2021, I spent three wonderful years as a postdoctoral researcher with the Department of Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park, advised by Professor Matthias Zwicker. I obtained my B.E. (2009), M.E. (2012) and Ph.D. (2017) from Northwestern Polytechnical University in Pattern Recognition and Intelligent Systems. My research interests include 3D computer vision, digital geometry processing, and artificial intelligence. Openings: I am always looking for self-motivated PhD students to work with me. If you are interested in my research, please feel free to send me an email. News [11/2025] Two papers on reconstruction with 3DGS and high-fidelity 3D representations are accepted at AAAI 2026.
