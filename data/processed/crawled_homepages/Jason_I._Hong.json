I am still doing some research at CMU related to Responsible AI, and also working on a new startup at the intersection of AI + HCI. My primary field is human-computer interaction. My areas of work are in usable privacy and security, mobile computing, Internet of Things, and AI fairness and bias. Below is a summary of some of my past work (see here for longer description): Pioneered research on protecting people from phishing scams. Our work on anti-phishing was adopted by industry groups, and inspired the design of anti-phishing browser warnings. Our work was also commercialized as Wombat Security, which was acquired by Proofpoint in 2018. Deployed Livehoods, which was the first paper to use geotagged social media to understand the dynamics of cities. Won ICWSM test of time award in 2022. Investigated Social Cybersecurity, which looked at how to adopt ideas from social psychology to positively influence peopleâs privacy and security behaviors. Won Honorable Mention for NSA Competition for Best Scientific Cybersecurity Paper. Pioneered new system architectures and developer tools for smartphone privacy, which has had positive impact on consumer privacy and on industry Deployed PrivacyGrade.org, a web site where we analyzed the privacy of over a million Android apps based on a model of peopleâs expectations of privacy Wrote The Design of Sites, one of the earliest books on user interface design patterns, sold about 100k copies worldwide Developed WeAudit, a suite of tools for helping everyday people collectively audit AI systems for bias and fairness Co-founded the Masterâs of Product Management (MSPM), a joint program between HCII and Tepper School of Business Supervised 21 Postdocs and PhD students, and taught hundreds of undergrads and masterâs students in classes, independent studies, and research projects My team's work has been featured in CNN, New York Times, BBC, CBS News, MIT Tech Review, World Economic Forum, and more. We have been generously funded by DARPA, National Science Foundation, Army Research Office, Amazon, Cisco, Google, IBM, Intel, Meta, Microsoft, Nokia, NQ Mobile, Pitney Bowes, Portugal Telecom, Samsung, Yahoo, CMU Cylab, Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and more. What's New? Nov 11, 2025 Gave a guest lecture giving an overview of Privacy and Security for Pervasive Computing.

Professor Emeritus at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm still doing some research on Responsible AI at CMU, while also working on new startup at the intersection of AI + HCI. Oct 18, 2024 Our paper Investigating What Factors Influence Usersâ Rating of Harmful Algorithmic Bias and Discrimination won a Best Paper Award at HCOMP 2024. The basic idea was to evaluate what kinds of biases people are more likely to find in image-based generative AI, based on their own demographics (race, gender, sexual orientation). Feb 27, 2024 I gave a talk entitled An Overview of Privacy for Mobile Sensing Systems for the mDOT NIH Center. This talk is a good crash course in privacy. Feb 8, 2024 Along with several of my colleagues at CMU, I was named a 2024 Microsoft Research AI & Society fellow to do work on to do work on Regulating AI in Light of the Challenges of Doing Responsible AI in Practice.
