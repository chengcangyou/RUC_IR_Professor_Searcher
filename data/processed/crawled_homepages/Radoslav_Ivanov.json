Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania, where I worked with Dr. George Pappas and Dr. Rajeev Alur. I received the B.A. degree with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematical Economics from Colgate University in 2011. I defended my PhD dissertation in 2017 at the University of Pennsylvania under the supervision of Dr. Insup Lee and Dr. James Weimer. Research Interests My research lies broadly in the field of safe and secure autonomy. The natural application domains of my work are safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS) such as automotive and medical CPS. I work both on design-time and run-time approaches to analyze the safety of these systems. My contributions include a verification technique for autonomous systems with neural network components (check out our tool Verisig!) as well as resilient and parameter-invariant detection techniques for sensor attacks and other unsafe events (e.g., oxygen desaturation). The fields relevant to my research are cyber-physical systems, formal methods, machine learning, control theory and sensor fusion. News I received the Outstanding Early Research Award from the School of Science, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute I was selected for the 2025 Young Investigator Program Award by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research I served as the co-chair of the artifact evaluation committee of ICCPS 2025. I received an NSF award on the topic of neuro-symbolic perception for state estimation and control of cyber-physical systems (collaboration with Ivan Ruchkin, University of Florida) I gave an invited talk at the University of Southern California Cyber-Physical Systems Seminar, on the topic of safe and secure autonomy, Feb. 2024. I served as the co-chair of the artifact evaluation committee of ICCPS 2024. Our paper \"Verifying the Safety of Autonomous Systems with Neural Network Controllers\" won the best paper award at the ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems for the period 2019-20!
