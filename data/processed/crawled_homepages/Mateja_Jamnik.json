I am also an associate fellow at the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence. I serve on the UK Home Office Science Advisory Council and previously as Specialist Adviser to the House of Lords Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence. I founded the women@CL initiative. I am interested in developing AI techniques for human-like computing - in my research I combine AI reasoning with machine learning techniques in order to advance the explainability of AI systems, and apply them to personalised medicine and tutoring systems. Broadly, my research is in the areas of artificial intelligence, human-like computation, machine learning, explainability, automated reasoning, diagrammatic reasoning, knowledge representation, theorem proving, cognitive science, and human-computer interaction. Some research projects: explainability methods for deep learning, integrating symbolic methods with neural machine learning (including LLMs) for reasoning (AI for math), human adaptable knowledge representations for AI systems, multi-modal machine learning, tabular foundation models.
