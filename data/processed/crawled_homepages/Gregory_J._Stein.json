Stein RAIL Group, GMU I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at George Mason University where I run the Robotic Anticipatory Intelligence & Learning (RAIL) Group. Our research, at the intersection of robotics and machine learning, is centered around developing representations that allow robots to better understand the impact of their actions, so that they may plan quickly and intelligently in a dynamic and uncertain world.

Recent and Highlighted News Summer 2025    My lab is delighted to be hosting three high school summer student interns through the gmu assip program. Welcome all! May 19, 2025   Many in the lab are headed to ieee icra 2025 in Atlanta. Not only are two of my students presenting papers, but my student Abhishek Paudel is both presenting a workshop paper on deployment-time prompt selection for llm-informed navigation under uncertainty at the icra fmns workshop and has been selected for the icra Doctoral Consortium for his work “Introspection for Long-Horizon Robot Planning under Uncertainty.” February 19, 2025    I gave a talk at Cornell University’s Robotics Seminar. Thanks again for having me! Here’s a recording of my talk, outlining our lab’s recent advances in planning under uncertainty: January 28, 2025    My lab had two papers accepted to ieee icra 2025: one on anticipatory planning for large-scale home environments and another on hybrid social navigation. We look forward to sharing these in Atlanta. January 9, 2025    I gave a talk at University of Milan on my recent work at the intersection of learning and anticipation for reliable task planning. December 2024   I, as principal investigator, and gmu collaborators Daigo Shishika, Xuesu Xiao, and Xuan Wang have been awarded a $1.7 million grant from the US Army Research Lab’s Tactical Behaviors and Maneuvers program. Read more about through the gmu news announcement. November 6, 2024     The rail Group had a busy Conference on Robot Learning (corl) 2024! First, my student Abhishek presentend a paper on multi-strategy domain adaptation for fast deployment-time improvement for navigation under uncertainty. Second, the lab presented a workshop paper at the Learning Effective Abstractions for Planning (leap) Workshop, at which I also gave an invited talk. October 16, 2024     We presented three papers at IROS 2024, spanning topics on active information gathering, learning-informed navigation, and team coordination on graphs. I also co-chaired the Robot Motion Planning 1 session. Fall 2024    I gave invited talks at Stevens Institute of Technology, Northeastern, The AI Institute (formerly BDAI), and Lehigh University. Thanks to all for hosting me and it was a pleasure getting to share all our exciting work! Summer 2024    The RAIL Group is delighted to be hosting four high school summer student interns through the George Mason University ASSIP program. Welcome to the lab! September 08 2023    I will be attending a workshop at Penn to contribute to the next National Robotics Roadmap. Update: the 2024 Roadmap for US Robotics is now live! December 2022    I co-organized a workshop Learning, Perception, and Abstraction for Long-Horizon Planning at CoRL 2022. Video for the entire workshop here! Fall 2020    I will be joining the Department of Computer Science at George Mason University as an Assistant Professor. October 2018    My paper Learning over Subgoals for Efficient Navigation of Structured, Unknown Environments was a Best Paper Finalist at the 2018 Conference on Robot Learning. My accompanying 15 minute talk was awarded Best Oral Presentation: See all news. Selected Publications See also our full publication list. Yimeng Li, Arnab Debnath, Gregory J.
