R. China +86-139-1704-7105 A copy of my CV, Research Statement, Teaching Statement Brief Bio I am an associate professor in the School of Computer Science, School of Software, Fudan University. I used to be a visiting scientist of MIT CSAIL from 2009 to 2015 (back and forth). I got a PhD in computer science from the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Science, and BS in computer science from Peking University. Research Interests Performance Science, an interdisciplinary research area at the intersection of parallel and concurrent computing, computational and data science, programming languages, systems and theory. I am particularly interested in pursuing scalable and portable performance for real-world applications and algorithms on modern computing systems by exploiting the balance among time, or equivalently parallelism for parallel algorithms, space, caching and communication.
