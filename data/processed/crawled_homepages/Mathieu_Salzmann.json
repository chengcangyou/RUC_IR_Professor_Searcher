Our long-term goal is to emulate this ability to interpret images and extract from them information about the world around us.More specifically, one important focus of our research is the recovery of deformable and articulated 3D shape and motion from video sequences. We are also active in the areas of multi-camera surveillance, computer assisted engineering, and medical image processing. Furthermore, we provide undergraduate and graduate teaching and transfer technology to both established and start up companies.
