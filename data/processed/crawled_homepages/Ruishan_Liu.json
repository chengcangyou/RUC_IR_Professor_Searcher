I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University in 2022, where I was fortunate to work with Prof. James Zou. I was a postdoctoral scholar in the department of Biomedical Data Science at Stanford University from 2022 to 2023. Prior to that, I received my bachelor's degree in Physics from Peking University. My research lies in the intersection of machine learning and applications in human diseases, health and genomics. I was selected as Rising Star in Data Science, Next Generation in Biomedicine, and Rising Star in Engineering in Health. Very honored that my project Trial Pathfinder - using AI to make clinical trials more inclusive - was selected as 2022 Top Ten Clinical Research Achievement and Finalist for Global Pharma Award 2021. I direct the Laboratory for Machine Learning, Health and Biomedicine at USC. We focus on a variety of machine learning problems inspired by health and biomedicine challenges. Our work involves developing efficient and reliable new algorithms in deep learning, large language models, reinforcement learning, and more. We are also committed to translating our efforts into impactful real-world applications, notably in areas like precision medicine and clinical trials. We are currently recruiting Research Interns for Fall 2025, if you're interested in applying, please complete the This Form. No separate email is needed; we’ll contact you if it’s a good fit. I am also seeking Ph.D. students (Fall 2026) who share our passion in ML & Biomedical AI. Feel free to contact if you are interested to join! Email: ruishanl [at] usc [dot] edu",
