I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology where I lead the Software Automation research group. My main research interests are in programming languages and software engineering. I aim to improve software development by automating tasks that currently require substantial manual engineering effort. My research focuses on developing automatic techniques that analyze, manipulate, and transform software. My broader interests include computer systems and security. Before joining HKUST in 2023, I received a PhD degree from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I worked with Professor Martin Rinard. I have also received a master's degree from MIT and a bachelor's degree from Peking University. Multiple open positions are available in our research group! Teaching COMP3021: Java Programming (Fall 2024, Fall 2023) COMP2711: Discrete Mathematical Tools for Computer Science (Spring 2024) Research Software plays a central role in numerous aspects of human society. Current software development practices involve significant developer effort in all phases of the software life cycle, including the development of new software, detection and elimination of defects and security vulnerabilities in existing software, maintenance of legacy software, and integration of existing software into more contexts. My group aims to automate software development tasks and enhance how people create, understand, and improve software. Towards this goal, we have developed automatic techniques that analyze, manipulate, and transform programs. Papers...
