What the coming of the computer did, \"just-in-time\" was to make it unnecessary to change the system in any way. So the computer has acted as fundamentally a conservative force, a force which kept power or even solidified power where it already existed.\" Joseph Weizenbaum \"Once, men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.\" Frank Herbert, Dune",
