Previously, I did a post-doc in Montreal at McGill University/Mila. I obtained a PhD in machine learning at the University of Liege in 2017. More information on my professional experience is available on my Linkedin profile. Information on my research and my teaching activities are provided below. Research My field of research is focused on deep learning and reinforcement learning. One main goal is to create agents that can learn how to perform sequential decision-making tasks while generalizing from limited data. My research focuses in particular on the role of representation learning and how it is possible to integrate model-free learning (direct inference from deep learning) with model-based learning (e.g. planning and \"reasoning\"). Two recent works: in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15345 (NeurIPS 2025), we present a neural network architecture that nearly doubles the performance of the recent PQN algorithm on the full suite of ATARI games. As compared to RAINBOW, it is an order of magnitude cheaper in compute and 50% better in score. In https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01529, we show how geometric prior knowledge can be incorporated in RL, which is useful for instance in first-person view environments or robotics. The full list of my publications can be found here. Teaching I'm currently teaching \"Projects on Reinforcement Learning\" as well as co-teaching \"Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning\". I am also the program director of the MSc AI at the VU Amsterdam since 2024 (cohorts of 150+ students). I have (co-)organized international scientific events, such as the RL summer school in 2022 and BeNeRL in 2024 (both with 100+ participants). Before 2020, I've taught for different courses such as: an introduction to deep RL in the context of the deep learning summer school organized by IVADO. a lecture on generalization in RL at the RL summer school in Lille. a few lessons as part of the courses IFT6390 - introduction to machine learning at the UniversitÃ© de Montreal as well as COMP-424 - Artificial intelligence and COMP652 - advanced machine learning at McGill University.
