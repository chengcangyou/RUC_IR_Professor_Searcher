For a quick example on how molecular dynamics simulations look like, please visit Prof. Bert de Groot's web page.Experimental work is carried out in the labs of my wonderful collaborators listed below.If you would like to know more about any of the projects or interested in collaboration, please get in touch via email.CollaboratorsDr Dalia Chakrabarty (University of York, UK)Dr James Garnett (KCL, UK)Professor Shozeb Haider (UCL, UK)Dr Avinash Kale (CEBS, University of Mumbai, India)Professor Ashutosh Kumar (IIT Bombay, India)Professor Faruck Morcos (UT Dallas, USA)Dr Alessandro Pandini (Brunel University of London, UK)Dr Giuseppe Sicoli (CNRS Lille, France)Google SitesReport abusePage detailsPage updated Google SitesReport abuse",
