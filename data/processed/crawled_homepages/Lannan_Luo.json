I received a B.S. degree in Communication Engineering from Xidian University of China in 2009, a M.S. degree in Communication and Information Engineering from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2012. I received a PhD degree in Information Sciences and Technology from Penn State University in August, 2017. The easiest way to contact me is through email at lluo4 (at) gmu (dot) edu. My research mainly focuses on software and systems security. My reserach interests include software analysis and verification, vulnerability analysis, malware analysis, programming languages, software engineering, and deep learning. RA Position is Available: Our Software and Systems Security research lab is recruiting PhD Students and Post-Doctoral Researchers. I am looking for motivated students! Please don't hesitate to email me if you are interested in my research. NEWS: 10/07/23 Our work that translates binaries across different instruction set architectures is accepted to Findings of EMNLP'23. 06/01/23 We propose a new direction for NLP-inspired binary analysis. It is accepted to USENIX Security'23. 02/27/23 Our work that found over twenty zero-day vulnerabilities (six CVEs assigned) is accepted at MobiSys'23. 07/11/22 Our work that built an AI-based implicit authentication system for everyday objects (such as doors, cabinets, and guns) is accepted to UbiComp'22. 03/14/22 Our work that builds the first secure and usable authentication system for drone delivery in the literature is accepted to MobiSys'22. 12/06/21 Our paper that presents the first smart app fuzzing system in the literature is accepted at ACSAC'21. 12/11/20 I've received the 2020 Young Investigator Research Award in College of Engineering and Computing at University of South Carolina. 08/04/20 I've received an NSF SaTC grant \"Semantics-Oriented Binary Code Analysis Learning from Recent Advances in Deep Learning.\" Thanks NSF! 07/28/20 Our work about secure and usable IoT pairing is accepted at CCS'20. 11/29/19 One paper \"Heap Memory Snapshot Assisted Program Analysis for Android Permission Specification\" is accepted at SANER'20. 07/11/19 A novel IoT authentication work is accepted at MobiCom'19. 05/29/19 Our work that detects adversarial examples and also rectifies the classfication results is accepted at RAID'19. 04/25/19 My CRII proposal is funded by NSF. Thank you NSF! 03/04/19 Our work that patches ALL heap vulnerabilities without changing the binary code is accepted at DSN'19. More news...
