Also check out the DTR documentary, Forward! Junior Faculty Support Group: I am running a junior faculty support group in fall 2025. Space is limited; please register by August 31st if interested! Design, Technology, & Research (DTR): Empowering undergraduate and graduate students to drive cutting-edge research that shape new experiences with people and technology. Apply now to start next quarter. Current students: I enjoy mentoring my students in DTR. Prospective PhD students: At the Delta Lab and through DTR, we transform the way people design, work, learn, and play. Join our interdisciplinary team of designers, technologists, and researchers. Apply through Technology and Social Behavior, CS+LS, or Computer Science. Faculty mentors: Check out Agile Research Studios, a new model for advancing research training. Start using Pair Research today, and enroll in Agile Research University and get our starter kit to start running your own studio. Conference organizers and attendees: Check out Cobi, a community-supported system for scheduling and attending a conference. Haoqi Zhang Associate Professor, CS+Design hq@northwestern.edu Mudd 3531 talks / letters / documentary CV / research / teaching / service DTR / Delta Lab Computer Science / Segal Design Technology & Social Behavior I am an Associate Professor in Computer Science and Design at Northwestern, where I direct the Design, Technology, and Research (DTR) program and co-direct the Delta Lab with Matt Easterday, Liz Gerber, and Nell O'Rourke. I also hold a courtesy appointment in the Learning Sciences. My research is multi-disciplinary, and bridges across Computer Science, Design, Learning Science, Psychology, and Philosophy. To get a good overview of my research and teaching practice, check out my recent talks, and read some DTR annual letters. The goal of my research is to advance the design of integrated socio-technical models that promote core human values. My personal research focuses on self-direction. I study what self-direction is; what gets in the way of self-direction; and how it can be fostered, developed, taught, and learned. If you are an expert on this topic, regardless of your field of practice, please reach out; I'd love to learn from you. With my students, I design, build, and study Computational Ecosystems that interweave effective practices, interactional structures, and intelligent systems to form new, integrative solutions. Through a critical technical practice, my students and I solve human problems and advance human values that remain unaddressed, even after decades of advances in computing and in HCI. Research directions my students have led include: agile research studios: advance research training with organizational processes and cyberlearning technologies for research communities.Values: metacognition; practice; belonging; personal growth. opportunistic collective experiences: connect at distance with computer programs that facilitate opportunistic interactions across time and space.Value: human connection readily available learning experiences: transform the entire web of professional code examples into opportunities for authentic learning. Values: self-directed learning; interest, exploration, and wonder flexible coordination: promote convenient individual contributions to a communal goal. Values: personal autonomy; service to community These and other projects are made possible through generously support from National Science Foundation grants in Cyber-Human Systems, Cyberlearning (1, 2, 3), RITEL, and the Research Initiation Initiative; a Google Faculty Research Award; Microsoft FUSE Labs Research Award; Northwestern's Murphy Society Grant; and Northwestern's Office of the Provost Award for Digital Learning.
