Mitchell David Mitchell Associate Professor of Computing Science My research interests involve application of mathematical logic to problems in computer science, in particular to declarative problem solving. These include SAT, Satisfiability-based problem solving, (theory of) Constraint Modelling Languages, Automated Reasoning, and use of interpretations (or, viewed from the other side, logically defined transductions on classes of structures) in problem solving and as a model of high-level declarative programming.
