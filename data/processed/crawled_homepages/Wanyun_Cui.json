He leads the SCALE Lab (SUFE Cognitive AI & Language Exploration Lab) here. His research interests lie at the large language model inference. He has published 20+ papers in NeurIPS, ICLR, SIGMOD, PVLDB, IJCAI, AAAI, ACL, and EMNLP. He has been recognized as an AI 2000 Most Influential Scholar Honorable Mention (2012-2021, 2013-2022) and has won the ACM China Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Nomination Award (top 4 in China) and the ACM Shanghai Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award (top 2 in Shanghai).Current Research ProjectsLLM-based Complex Reasoning We explore techniques to enhance LLMs’ reasoning capabilities.Efficient LLM Inference We optimize the efficiency of LLM inference, including long-context LLM and parameter quantization.LLMs for Domain Applications (e.g. Finance and Education) We develop specialized LLM applications based on FinChat, such as automated financial analysis, research report generation, retrieval-augmented QA, and expert role-playing.🔴 For students interested in my research: I am recruiting students who are passionate about artificial (general) intelligence and possess strong programming skills (experience with open-source projects is a plus).What we offer:Learning: Customized LLM training plans tailored to your development. And GPU resourcesResearch: Opportunities to explore cutting-edge LLM problems and publish in top AI conferencesPractice: Hands-on experience with real LLM applications and potential internships from leading tech companies (Alibaba, Ant Group, ByteDance, etc.)🔴 If you are interested, please do not hesitate to contact me.🔥 News 🔥2025/10.
