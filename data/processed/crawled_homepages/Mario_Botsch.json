Since 2025 Iâm also a PI in the Lamarr Institute. Before joining TU Dortmund in fall 2020, I was professor for Computer Graphics at Bielefeld University (2008â2020). I studied mathematics and received my M.Sc. from the University of Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg (1999). After that I started my PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics, before moving to RWTH Aachen and finishing my PhD in computer science (2005). Afterwards I was PostDoc at ETH Zurich (2005â2008). The focus of my research is the efficient acquisition, discretization, optimization, animation, and visualization of three-dimensional geometric objects. On the more theoretical side, we are investigating flexible, non-standard geometry discretizations and the involved differential operators. On the more practical side, we are working on 3D-scanning and motion capturing of humans, modelling and animation of virtual characters, and real-time visualization in VR scenarios. I regularly teach courses on Computer Graphics, Computer Animation, Geometric Modeling, and Mathematics for Computer Science. For all my teaching Iâm an avid user (and developer) of Decker, a cool tool for interactive HTML-based lecture slides.
