In 1984 he received his doctorate with W. Boehm as thesis adviser. From 1986 to 1987, he was a postdoctoral and junior research fellow at the IBM Research Lab in Yorktown Heights, where he pioneered new techniques for the analysis of subdivision methods with C. A. Micchelli. After three years as assistant professor at the Mathematics Department of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY, he became professor of Applied Geometry and Computer Graphics at the Universitaet Karlsruhe in 1990. Additionally, he had been a member of the board of the Institute for Scientific Computing and Mathematical Modelling at Karlsruhe (1992-2003) , and in 2002 he succeeded J. Hoschek as co-editor-in-chief of the journal Computer Aided Geometric Design till 2014. Four of his PhD students have become professors themselves: Leif Kobbelt, Georg Umlauf, Lars Linsen, and Andreas Müller.",
