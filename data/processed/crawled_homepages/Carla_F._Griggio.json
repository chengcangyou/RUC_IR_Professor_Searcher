GriggioI study technologies for interpersonal communication and build alternatives that grant people more control over how they maintain relationships online. Follow From Argentina 🇦🇷 Aalborg University, Denmark 🇩🇰 Email ResearchGate Twitter Google Scholar ORCIDI’m a tenure-track assistant professor at the Department of Computer Science at Aalborg University in Copenhagen. My main research studies how communication technologies, especially messaging apps, affect interpersonal relationships. I conduct empirical studies to understand how people adapt software to fit their communication needs and build prototypes that explore ways of providing them with richer control over their expression and relationship maintenance. I’m currently studying interoperability between messaging apps and exploring alternative software models to “apps” for online communication.Previously, I was a post-doc researcher at the Department of Computer Science at Aarhus University, working with Susanne Bødker in the Collaboration & Computer-Human Interaction (CoCHI) team, as well as in the Department of Digital Design and Information Studies in Aarhus University with Clemens Klokmose. I also worked at the IIS Lab in The University of Tokyo with Koji Yatani. My defended my Ph.D. thesis “Designing for Ecosystems of Communication Apps” in 2018, which I did at Université Paris-Saclay and Inria under the supervision of Wendy Mackay. I’m an EIT Digital alumni from the Human-Computer Interaction and Design Master Program in Université Paris-Saclay and KTH. Before specializing on HCI, I studied Information Systems Engineering in Universidad Tecnológica Nacional in Buenos Aires, Argentina.Latest news:I am teaching a course on UI evaluation methods at the ECI winter school organized by the University of Buenos Aires (UBA): see details here.I will be giving a talk at the inaugural Matrix conference in Berlin, Germany, titled “The Walled Garden Dilemma: Privacy vs. App Choice in Messaging Ecosystems”. The talk will give an overview of my research on ecosystems of messaging apps and its implications for messaging interoperability.",
