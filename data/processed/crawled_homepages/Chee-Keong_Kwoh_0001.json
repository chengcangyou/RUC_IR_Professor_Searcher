RESEARCH EXPERTISE My main interests lie in our desire to making sense of big heterogeneous data for real application in engineering, life science, and medical. Data Science (Bioinformatics) Research High throughput biological measurements and experiments in life science and healthcare have resulted in the explosion of data available from sequencing and micro-arrays, ChIP-Microarrays (ChIP-chip). This has led to the interdisciplinary science called Bioinformatics. Which use Data Science in solving biological and life science problems. Machine Learning and Statistical Inference Machine Learning and statistical modelling techniques that can learn from data to enables the making of the decision and simply a classification, this has application in almost every area. There are many approaches and each has its own merits. The following have been heavily used in my group: support vector machines, decision tree learning, artificial neural networks, Bayesian networks, genetic and mimetic algorithms. Example include application in supertype-specific HLA Class I binding peptides, protein-ligand binding affinity. Learning with Unlabeled Data In the context of machine learning, PU learning is a collection of semi-supervised techniques for training binary classifiers on positive (P) and unlabeled (U) examples. To improve performance, it is important to partition U into four sets, namely, reliable negative set RN, likely positive set LP, likely negative set LN, and weak negative set WN. Such an approach has been used to identifying disease genes from the human genome is an important but challenging task in biomedical research. Meta and Ensemble learning Meta-learning is where automatic learning algorithms are applied to meta-data about machine learning experiments. The main goal is to use meta-data to understand how automatic learning can become flexible in solving different kinds of learning problems and enrich the knowledge discovered. Coupled with ensemble methods that that integrates results of multiple predictive methods into one system, these approach has found to be instrumental in improving predictive performance. Application of this approach has been widely used in big data such as bioinformatics and medical informatics. An example includes multiple kernel learning for heterogeneous data fusion and sparse learning in genome-wide association study (GWAS), and drug-target interaction prediction. Ontology for Knowledge Representation Ontology is a formal representation of a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts. There have been major initiatives in medical and bioinformatics to standardize the representation of terminology and relationship across diseases, species and databases. The controlled vocabulary of terms and description of product characteristics are the main outcome to improve annotation for representation of meta-concept that greatly enhances analysis. Specifically, it has been extensively applied in complex mining, inferring gene-disease-phenotype association. Computational Structural Biology This is where Computational Science and Engineering finds its applications in understanding the molecular structure of biological macromolecules. Dealing with computational models and simulations, the field makes use of high-performance computing to solve complex and expensive problems in biology. The result includes the acceleration of docking and its application in the understanding of influenza and other viruses. SOFTWARE CovalentDock Cloud: a web server for automated covalent docking Covalent binding is an important mechanism for many drugs to gain its function. We developed a computational algorithm to model this chemical event and extended it to a web server, the CovalentDock Cloud, to make it accessible directly online without any local installation and configuration. It provides a simple yet user-friendly web interface to perform covalent docking experiments and analysis online. Software for Accelerating Autodock Vina Quickvina: This project aims at accelerating Autodock Vina, a program for protein-ligand docking. The main idea is to skip some of the local searches which are not promising in finding a better solution. Quick Vina 2 is a fast and accurate molecular docking tool, attained at accurately accelerating AutoDock Vina. It was tested against 195 protein-ligand complexes that compose the core set of the 2014 release of the PDBbind using default exhaustiveness level of 8, QVina 2 successfully attained up to 20.49-fold acceleration over Vina.
