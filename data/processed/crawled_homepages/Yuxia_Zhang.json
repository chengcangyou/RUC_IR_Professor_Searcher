I am currently a Tenured Associate Professor with the School of Computer Science and Technology at Beijing Institute of Technology, China. I received my Ph.D degree in July 2020 from School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), Peking University, China. I was very fortunate to work under the supervision of Prof. Minghui Zhou and Prof. Zhi Jin . My research primarily focuses on improving the quality and efficiency of software development through empirical studies to build and identify new theories and applying big data mining, deep learning, and LLMs to develop intelligent support tools. We are also interested in improving the sustainability of open source software, under which I am broadly interested in improving our understanding of companies' engagement with open source software projects. My research has been published in top-tier conferences and journals, including TSE, TOSEM, ICSE, ESEC/FSE, and ASE, and received two ACM SIGSOFT distinguished paper awards, i.e., ICSE 2022 and ESEC/FSE 2023. Our group is actively recruiting self-motivated undergraduate/master/PhD students interested in AI for software development, open source software, or empirical software engineering. Don't hesitate to contact me if you are interested in working with us. News 🎉 One paper has been accepted to ICSE 2026 in the first cycle! Congratulations to Qunhong! 🎉 One paper has been accepted to TSE 2025! Congratulations to Mian Qin! 🎉 Two papers have been accepted to FSE 2025! Congratulations to Mian Qin and Meng Fan! 🎉 One paper has been accepted to ICSE 2025 in the first cycle! Congratulations to Qunhong! 🎉 I opened a new course at BIT, i.e., open source software development. I hope to guide students in making their first OSS contribution! 🎉 Our survey on commercial participation in open source software has been accepted in TOSEM! Congratulations to Xuetao! 🎉 Our work won the ACM Distinguished Paper Award from the 31st ACM Joint European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (ESEC/FSE 2023) 🎉 One coauthored paper has been accepted to ASE 2023. 🎉 Three coauthored papers have been accepted to ESEC/FSE 2023. 🎉 One paper has been accepted to TSE 2023. 🎉 Our paper on Corporate Dominance in Open Source Development was accepted to FSE 2022! 🎉 I am a recipient of the ACM Distinguished Paper Award in the 44th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2022)！",
