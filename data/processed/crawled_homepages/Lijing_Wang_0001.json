I am previously a research fellow with Prof. Timothy Miller and Prof. Guergana Savova in the Computational Health Informatics Program (CHIP) at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. I completed my Ph.D. of Computer Science at the University of Virginia, co-supervised by Prof. Madhav Marathe and Prof. Jiangzhuo Chen. [08/22/2025] There are NO openings. Research Interests My research interests span across artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), natural language processing (NLP), time series analysis, graph learning, and network science, with a strong emphasis on solving problems in networks and sequences. My work is inherently interdisciplinary, bridging theoretical foundations with practical applications to address complex, real-world challenges, such as epidemic forecasting, EHR data analysis, human behavior analysis, or recommender systems. Big Events The ICDM 2025 conference will be held in Washington DC, in November 2025. My colleague and I are organizing the PhD Forum. More details, please refer to this link. The AAAI 2025 conference will be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in February, 2025. My colleague and I are organizing a two-day doctoral consortium for AAAI. PhD students are encouraged to submit their work by Sep 30, 2024. For more details, please refer to this link. Accepted submissions (thesis summary) will automatically be included in the AAAI proceedings. We will have an exciting debate: Teaching in AI Era: Challenges and Opportunities at ACSIC (Association of Chinese Scholars in Computing) SOFA 2024, May 2024 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
