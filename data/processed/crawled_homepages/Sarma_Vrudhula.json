He received a bachelor's degree in mathematics from the University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, in 1976, majoring in computer science and mathematical statistics. He moved to Venice CA in 1977 and while enrolled as a graduate student at in EE-Systems department at the University of Southern California, worked as a research assistant in USC Information Sciences Institute in Marina Del Rey, CA.  He received his master's and doctoral degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California in 1980 and 1985, respectively. During 1985-1992, he was on the faculty of the EE-Systems department of the University of Southern California. From 1992 to 2005, he was a professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of Arizona. During that period, he was the founding director of the NSF UA/ASU Center for Low Power Electronics. He joined ASU in 2005, and became the director for the Center for Embedded Systems at ASU in 2006, which became an NSF IUCRC Center in 2009.  He became a fellow of the IEEE for “contributions to low power and energy-efficient design of digital circuits and systems.” His work spans several areas in design automation and computer-aided design for digital integrated circuit and systems, focusing on energy management of circuits and systems. Specific topics include: energy optimization of battery powered computing systems and wireless sensor networks; system level dynamic power and thermal management of multicore processors and system-on-chip (SoC); statistical methods for the analysis of process variations; statistical optimization of performance, power and leakage; new circuit architectures of threshold logic circuits for the design of ASICs and FPGAs; technology mapping with threshold logic circuits; the implementation of threshold logic using spintronic devices, and non-Boolean computation in emerging technologies. His teaching experience includes both undergraduate and graduate courses in digital systems design and testing, VLSI design, CAD algorithms for VLSI, advanced synthesis and verification methods, computer architecture, and discrete mathematics.
