The paper submission deadline is 19th January, 2026 (Anywhere on Earth). The Workshop's proceedings will be published by IEEE and be avialable on IEEE Xplore. Please consider submitting your work to the Workshop! Call for PhD applications: 1) The School of Computing at the University of Kent has 1 Huawe-funded PhD scholarship, which is open to both home and overseas applicants. Deadline: Sunday 30 November 2025 23:59 GMT. More information can be found here. 2) The University of Kent is calling for applications of 39 SEDarc PhD scholarships in social sciences, which are open to both home and overseas applicants. Applicants interested in socio-technical cyber security topics are welcome to apply. Deadline: Sunday 23 November 2025 23:59 GMT. More information can be found here. News: On 22nd July 2025, the EPSRC-funded CRANE NetworkPlus organised its online launch webinar. The CRANE NetworkPlus has a goal to facilitate the development of a new learned society in cyber security research during the funding period, and Shujun is currently leading the activities in this area. Shujun gave a short talk about the plan at the webinar. A Preparation Committee / CRANE Working Group on forming the learned society is being shaped. Highlighted Activities: In October 2024, iCSS organised the 2024 iCSS Cyber Security Awareness Month (iCSS-CSM24), which includes many colourful activities such as a \"Creative Cyber\" Exhibition, four screening nights, two escape room games and five comic books supplied by Xcapism Learning Ltd, one cyber/AL fabels event, one NCSC CyberFirst Girls Familiarisation Day, and the IET Jennison Lecture 2024 on âFrom data flow analysis to data security, privacy, responsible AI, and moreâ given by Shujun. A news story about the Month can be found here. Two animated videos for cyber security awareness: Since 2022, iCSS researchers have been producing animated videos for cyber security awareness, as free resources for all. 1) In 2022, working with Scriberia, a school ICT teacher, two school pupils (9-year-olds) and a number of cyber security researchers at the University of Kent, iCSS made an animated video entitled \"How to be a cyber superhero\" for young children and schools to understand more about the interdisciplinary nature of cyber security, the diverse career options and the importance of continuous learning and collaboration. The video was also converted to an illustrated children's book and it can downloaded for free from here. A news story about it can be found here. 2) In 2023, working with SciAni and a number of cyber security researchers at the University of Kent, iCSS made a second animated video entitled \"Why does cyber security matter for everyone?\". It uses a number of real-world scenarios to inform the general public about online risks and how they can better protect themselves in the cyber world, or the Internet of Everything. A news story about it can be found here. New resource for children: The first animated video above has also been converted to a digital book free for all to use. Please download it from here. New resource (last updated on 21 January 2024): Shujun is maintaining an online bibliography of SoK (Systematization of Knowledge) papers, a new type of research papers made popular since IEEE S&P 2010. Welcome to use it and report missing entries. Brief Biography (CV) Shujun Li received his BE degree in Information Science and Engineering in 1997, and his PhD degree in Information and Communication Engineering in 2003 under supervision of Prof. Yuanlong Cai (è¡å é¾) and Prof. Xuanqin Mou (çè½©æ²), both from the Xi'an Jiaotong University (è¥¿å®äº¤éå¤§å­¦). During 2003 to 2005, he was a postdoctoral Research Assistant with the Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong (é¦æ¸¯åå¸å¤§å­¦), under supervision of Prof. Guanrong (Ron) Chen (éå ³è£). From 2005 to 2007, he was a postdoctoral fellow funded by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (é¦æ¸¯çå·¥å¤§å­¦)'s Postdoctoral Fellowships Scheme, working at the Department of Electronic and Information Engineering with Dr. Kwok-Tung Lo (å¢å½æ ). From 2007 to 2008, he was a Humboldt Research Fellow and doing his research at the FernUniversitÃ¤t in Hagen, Germany, hosted by Prof. Dr. Dr. Wolfgang A. Halang. From 2008 to 2011, he was a 5-Year Research Fellow at the Zukunftskolleg (Institute for Advanced Study), UniversitÃ¤t Konstanz, Germany, and a junior faculty member of the Department of Computer and Information Science, working closely with Prof. Dr. Dietmar Saupe's group on Multimedia Signal Processing. In September 2011, he joined the Department of Computing (renamed to Department of Computer Science in August 2015), University of Surrey, UK, as a Senior Lecturer and then a Reader (Associate Professor). From 2014 to 2017, he was a Deputy Director of the Surrey Centre for Cyber Security (SCCS), leading the cross-cutting research theme Human Factors (known as Human-Centred Security between July 2014 and January 2017). Since November 2017, he has been a Professor of Cyber Security at the University of Kent, leading the Security Group of its School of Computing and the university-wide Kent Interdisciplinary Research Centre in Cyber Security (KirCCS). From January 2021, he has been the Founding Director of the Institute of Cyber Security for Society (iCSS), the third university-wide institute at the University of Kent. Since 2000, Shujun Li has published over 100 scientific papers with five Best Paper Awards and one Honorable Mention, and his research interests are mainly on cyber security (including usable security and user privacy, digital forensics and cyber crime, security and privacy in online social networks, mobile security and systems security in general, information hiding, human behavior/scam/crime/privacy aspects and AI/multimedia applications using distributed ledger techonologies, but NOT cryptography and purely theoretical aspects), data analytics and multimedia computing (including visual quality assessment and image/video coding), and human factors (including usability, human behaviors, and accessibility), applications (i.e., NOT theory) of artificial intelligence, education and learning since 2021. He also keeps his older research interests in applications of discrete optimization to multimedia computing especially recovering of unknown/missing/lost/manipulated information in digital images and videos (see here for a representative publication), and interdisciplinary topics betwen nonlinear science (chaos/fractals) and electronic engineering and computer science epecially digital degradation of chaotic systems in the digital domain (see here and here for two representative publications) and cryptanalysis of chaos-based secure communications schemes and digital ciphers. More about Shujun's research interests can be found here. Shujun Li is a Fellow of the BCS, a Senior Member of the IEEE, a Professional Member of the ACM and a Global Member of the Internet Society (ISOC). From 2009-2011 he was a member of MPEG (ISO/IEC JCT 1/SC 29/WG 11), and in 2012 was awarded an ISO/IEC Certificate of Appreciation for being the lead editor of ISO/IEC 23001-4:2011 \"Information technology â MPEG systems technologies â Part 4: Codec configuration representation\", the 2nd edition of the MPEG RVC standard. Professional Activities To Prospective Research (PhD/Visiting) Students To Prospective RAs/RFs/VRs Terms: RAs = (Postdoctoral) Research Assistants / Research Associates, RFs = (Postdoctoral) Research Fellows, VRs = Visiting Researchers If you have obtained your doctoral degree and want to do research with me as an RA/RF or a VR, please check the News section of this page and my Research page for research positions. When there are no open positions, you are still welcome to contact me as there are various research fellowship schemes I can help you apply. Scientometrics Such quantitative scientometrics are given only for reference and should be used with great caution. Remember this: \"Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.\" Read Shujun's presentation on \"How to Do (Good) Research? Starting from Scientometrics...\" to understand more about his approach to such scientometrics. h-index Self-Citations Excluded: h-index = 45 (estimated from data in ResearchGate) Self-Citations Included: h-index = 48 (estimated from data in ResearchGate) h-index = 53 (estimated from data in Google Scholar Citations) ErdÅs Number = 3 This scientometric is more for fun. There are other similar metrics defined by people, e.g., Bacon's number and Morphy number. Paul ErdÅs Prof. Charles K.
