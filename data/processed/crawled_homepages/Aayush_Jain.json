at NTT Research.Even before, I was a PhD student at UCLA where I was advised by Prof.  Amit Sahai. Research Interests: I am interested in theoretical and applied cryptography, and its connections with related areas of theoretical computer science.  Here is my Google Scholar profile.If you are interested in working with me as a PhD student, please apply to CMU CS PhD program!Email: aayush ja at
