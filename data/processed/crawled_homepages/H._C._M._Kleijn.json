In 2015 she was a visiting professor at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of Nicolaus Copernicus University, Torun, Poland. She is the head of�the Theory cluster of LIACS and is also affiliated with the Bioinformatics cluster. Her research areas are the theory of concurrency, bio-inspired computing and the modelling of biological systems, and theory of automata and formal languages. Currently, her research focuses on the modelling of concurrent and distributed systems with understanding and capturing concurrency phenomema in the behaviour of such systems as its underlying aims. Petri nets provide a suitable framework for this research but other models are also considered. Central themes are causality, order structures, formal models inspired by biochemical processes, modeling of biological processes, and composition of and collaboration in multi-component systems. Jetty Kleijn is a member of the Steering Committee for the International Conferences on Application and Theory of Petri Nets and Other Models of Concurrency and Tutorial Chair and moderator of the Petri Net Course at these conferences. She is an associate editor of the LNCS Transactions on Petri Nets and Other Models of Concurrency (ToPNoC) and an editor of the journal Fundamenta Informaticae.
