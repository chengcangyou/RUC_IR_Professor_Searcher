My research interests include discrete geometry, graph theory, and topological combinatorics.I was born and raised in Shanghai, and in my free time, I enjoy board gaming and skiing.I am making Semina. Artificial intelligence is reshaping higher education. Semina brings back real learning through guided, instructor-aligned reasoning.I co-organize the Discrete Mathematics Seminar at ASU, where we explore a variety of exciting topics in the field. If you’re interested, feel free to check out our schedule. We’d love to have you join us!Since October 2024, I’ve been coaching ASU’s ICPC team, Chaiwala Ballers. This past season, we placed 12th at the North America Championship, earning a spot at the prestigious ICPC World Finals in Baku, Azerbaijan. At the World Finals, the team delivered an outstanding performance, solving nine problems and finishing 17th overall, which earned ASU a Highest Honors award.In the 2025–2026 season, ASU’s ICPC team Second Wind finished second in the Rocky Mountain Regional, securing a spot at the upcoming North America Championship.I put together a little tool called Findliner to help boost my productivity by adding line numbers to PDFs. It’s been really useful for me, and you might find it handy too!I organized the Math Kangaroo competition for students in grades 1–12 in the greater Phoenix area in 2025. I’ll be organizing it again on March 19, 2026.
