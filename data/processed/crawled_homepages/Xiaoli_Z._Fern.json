Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China 2000 Short Biography: Dr. Xiaoli Fern is an assistant professor at the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, since 2005.  She received her Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, in 2005 and her M.S. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong university (SJTU), Shanghai China in 2000. Her general research interest is in the area of machine learning and data mining. She received an NSF Career Award in 2011. She co-organized the first International Workshop on Discovering, Utilizing and Summarizing Multiple Clustering (MultiClust KDD 2010), and served as the publicity chair for International Conference on Machine Learning in 2007. Dr. Xiaoli Fern is currently an editorial board member of the Machine Learning Journal and serves regularly on the program committee for a number of top tier international conferences on machine learning and data mining such as ICML, ECML, AAAI, KDD, ICDM, SIAM SDM. Research: My primary research interest is in the areas of machine learning and data mining. My research is largely driven by practical applications and the challenges they present to traditional machine learning and data mining techniques. Below is a sample of my current and past research projects and some selected publications related to these projects. See my publication list for a more complete list of publications. Fundamental research: Explorative data clustering involves grouping objects into clusters such that similar objects are grouped together. My research attemps to advance the field of unsupervised clutsering in a number of directions. First, motivated by the fact that objects in a data set maybe similar to each other in multiple different ways, and different clustering structures may exist in the same data. I am interested in exploratively examining data in different ways to produce different clusterings. Such clusterings can be sometimes combined to provide a more reliable view of the structure of the data via cluster ensemble methods, or other times examined individually as they may provide different insights (non-redundant clustering). Clustering with partial supervision and active learning.  Due to the inherent embiguous nature of the clustering task, in practice it is very useful to consider some user-provided side information such that a learning algorithm can seek to find a underlying clustering struture to that is most consistent with the side information. For example such information can be expressed in terms of pairwise constraints requiring some objects to be placed together or apart. I am interested in developing clustering techniques that can take into consideration richer forms of user constraints (e.g., comparative constraints involving multiple objects), and active learning frameworks that effectively acquire various form of user inputs without imposing heavy burden on the users. This work is supported by  my NSF career grant. For more details, please see the project page here. Selected publications: Wei Zhang, Akshat Surve, Xiaoli Z.

In this project, we record and analyze bird songs to predict bird species and to understand the behavior of birds through their songs. This is a joint project with Dr. Raviv Raich (ECE, OSU) and Dr. Matthew Betts (Forrestry, OSU). See project webpage for more exciting details and publications related to this topic.

Experimental design and Bayesian Optimization . In this project, we develop machine learning techniques to help scientists and engineers to desgin better microbial fuels by allowing them more efficiently experiment with different nano-structures. This is an experimental design problem --- how to choose appropriate experiments to perform under a budget constraint.

Mining human strategies (behavioral patterns) from human computer interaction data . In this research, we apply data mining to HCI log data with the goal of finding interesting behavioral patterns that shed some lights on the strategies users employ while using software for problem solving.
