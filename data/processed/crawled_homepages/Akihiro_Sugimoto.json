Computer Vision and Discrete Geometry Group Home Members Projects Publications Awards Contact Welcome to the web-site of the Computer Vision and Discrete Geometry group at the National Institute of Informatics (NII), Japan. Our research and education cover a wide range of topics in computer vision ranging from fundamental theories to application systems. We aim at developing new theories and algorithms, as well as systems and applications. Our current focus is on modeling a large-scale indoor scene using an RGB-D camera, gaze detection and navigation, and discrete geometric model fitting. Please check out the project page for more detail. Highly motivated students who like to pursuit their ph D are welcome to joining our group. If you are interested in our group, feel free to contact Akihiro Sugimoto. News 2025.04. Update: Members 2024.06. Update: Members 2024.03. Update: Members 2024.03. Update: Publifications 2023.09.
