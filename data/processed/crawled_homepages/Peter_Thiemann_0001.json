Specialization is for insects. -Robert Heinlein, writer (1907-1988) You can never understand one language until you understand at least two. -Ronald Searle, artist (1920- ) To know another language is to have a second soul. -Charlemagne, king (742-814) Pedantry and mastery are opposite attitudes toward rules. To apply a rule to the letter, rigidly, unquestioningly, in cases where it fits and in cases where it does not fit, is pedantry... To apply a rule with natural ease, with judgment, noticing the cases where it fits, and without ever letting the words of the rule obscure the purpose of the action or the opportunities of the situation, is mastery. -George Polya, professor of mathematics (1887-1985) Several excuses are always less convincing than one. -Aldous Huxley, novelist (1894-1963) If you don't understand interpreters, you can still write programs; you can even be a competent programmer. But you can't be a master. -Hal Abelson, Foreword to \"Essentials of Programming Languages\" by Friedman, Wand, and Haynes One must be drenched in words, literally soaked in them, to have the right ones form themselves into the proper patterns at the right moment. -Hart Crane, poet (1899-1932) Fun with Translations english: pushdown automaton ->spanish: automata con pila ->english: automaton with battery pila has further interesting meanings like basin or atomic plant Peter Thiemann designed by www.agrafix.net",
