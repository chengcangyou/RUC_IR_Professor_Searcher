Member of the formal methods research group which is part of the Formal Analysis, Theory and Algorithms research section. I am also the co-lead for the School's Equality, Diversity and Inclusion committee. Co-leader of SICSA's Modelling and Abstraction research theme between 2012-16. Between 2019-25 I was the Deputy Head of the School. Senior Research Fellow at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford working on the FUN2MODEL: From FUNction-based TO MOdel-based automated probabilistic reasoning for DEep Learning research project. My research is within the field of formal verification with emphasis on quantitative formal methods, particularly models and algorithms for systems exhibiting real-time and probabilistic behaviour. My interests within this field includes its application to software, security protocols and biological systems, as well as techniques for abstraction and refinement, compositional analysis and using game theory. For further details see my publication page. If you are interested completing a PhD related to my research, then please contact me. You can find information about the application process here. [biography] [publications] [activities] [projects] [teaching] [contact] Biography I obtained a degree in mathematics from the University of Oxford and a PhD in computer science from the University of Birmingham. Between 1998 and 2007 I was a Research Fellow in the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham working on the EPSRC funded projects: \"Automatic Verification of Randomized Distributed Algorithms\" (rated outstanding), \"Verification of Quality of Service Properties in Timed Systems\" (rated outstanding) and \"Probabilistic Model Checking of Mobile Ad Hoc Network Protocols\". In addition during this time I contributed to the \"A Future Of Reliable Wireless Ad-hoc networks of Roaming Devices (FORWARD) project\" which was part of the Next Wave Technologies and Markets, and was a team member of the \"Predictive modelling of signalling pathways via probabilistic model checking with PRISM\" project (funded by Microsoft Research Cambridge). From July 2007 until November 2009, I was a research officer in the Oxford University Computing Laboratory working on the EPSRC funded project \"UbiVal: Fundamental Approaches to Validation of Ubiquitous Computing Applications and Infrastructures\" (EPSRC Research Grant EP/D077273/1) which is a collaboration between University of Birmingham, Oxford, UCL and Imperial College. In November 2009, I became a lecturer in the School of Computing Science at the University of Glasgow and in July 2017 a senior lecturer. I am also one of the principal developers for the probabilistic verification tool PRISM.
