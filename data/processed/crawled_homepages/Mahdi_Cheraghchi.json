Previously, I have been on the faculty of the Department of Computing, Imperial College London (where I maintain an Honorary Senior Lecturer position), a Qualcomm Research Fellow at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing of U.C. Berkeley and post-doctoral scholar at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (hosted by Piotr Indyk), Computer Science Department of the Carnegie Mellon University (hosted by Venkatesan Guruswami) and the University of Texas at Austin (hosted by David Zuckerman). Prospective students: Our CS Theory lab is always looking for motivated Ph.D. students with strong math background. If you are a prospective student interested in theoretical computer science, information and coding theory, privacy or related subjects (see my interests below), please contact me and describe your background and goals. Apply to our graduate program here, and mention my name as your potential advisor in your application. We don't require GRE scores and accept several English language proficiency tests (TOEFL, IELTS, and more). Application fee waivers: I stand against application fees. I'm especially disappointed by the fact that nearly all US schools do not provide any application fee waivers for international students, which I see as a form of discrimination and I will continue to work against such policies. Until that changes, if you are a qualified international Ph.D. applicant applying to join the CS Theory lab and are unable to pay the application fee, please contact me. Like past years, I hope to be able to help a limited number of qualified applicants by paying their application fees. Post-doc positions: While I personally don't currently have funding for a new postdoc at the moment, our amazing UM CS theory lab is generally eager to recruit postdocs. We formally advertise any opportunities on the CS theory jobs website. Please also feel free to contact me or any faculty member who is a good fit for your research plans. Current students at the U of M: I'm always glad to meet with you and chat about anything, including but not limited to courses, research collaborations, general academic and professional advice, and concerns and misconduct. To reach out and schedule an appointment, simply send me an email and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. We can also have a virtual meeting if you prefer.

I received my PhD in Computer Science from EPFL, Switzerland, where I worked as a research assistant in the Laboratory of Algorithms (ALGO) under supervision of Amin Shokrollahi. I'm mainly interested in Theoretical Computer Science, or more specifically: Interconnections between electrical engineering and theoretical computer science (particularly coding and information theory and signal processing), Sparse recovery (e.g., compressive sensing and combinatorial group testing) and high-dimensional geometry, Information-theoretic privacy and security, The use of randomness in computation, and how to do things equally well without using randomness, Approximation algorithms and hardness of approximation.
