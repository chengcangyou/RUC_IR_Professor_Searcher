  "content": "Sanjiva Prasad My research interests are in the broad area of Formal Methods: programming languages and their semantics; concurrency theory; verification; proof theory; mobile computation; formal foundations of networks, including IoT and SDN; security, especially in information flow; formal models for reconfigurable architectures. I have also some work in systems biology, computational biology, and medical applications of computing. I take a broad approach to programming language issues. Some of the areas I have explored and in which I have guided students include security and integrity of information; ``Eco-Designââ and architectures for information representation; phonetic encodings of text; IDEs and the interaction with context; working in resource-challenged scenarios; reasoning about system execution beyond programmer control.
