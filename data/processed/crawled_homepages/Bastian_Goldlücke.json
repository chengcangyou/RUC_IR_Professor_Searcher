Previously, he held postdoc positions at the University of Heidelberg (2011), TU Munich (2010) and the University of Bonn (2009). He received his Ph.D. from the MPI for computer science in Saarbruecken (2006). His main research interests are variational methods and their applications in computer vision, in particular inverse problems in light field analysis. He regularly serves as a reviewer for major conferences and journals, co-organized the first and second workshop on \"Light Fields for Computer Vision\" at ECCV 2014 and CVPR 2017, and was area chair for ACCV 2014 and 3DV 2016. His research is supported by the ERC Starting Grant \"Light Field Imaging and Analysis\" awarded in 2013, and the SFB Transregio \"Quantitative Methods for Visual Computing\".
