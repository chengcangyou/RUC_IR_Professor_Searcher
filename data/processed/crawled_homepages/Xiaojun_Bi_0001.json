It has been incorporated into Googleâs Gboard, enabling large-scale real-world deployment. You can try it by installing Googleâs Gboard on Android and enabling the ClearFlow layout. WordGesture-GAN is a generative AI model that simulates typing behavior on soft keyboards. This model has been adopted by major soft-keyboard makers (e.g., Grammarly Inc.) to simulate user typing behaviors for training their keyboard algorithms. Here is a Grammarly Engineering Blog article describing the integration of our model. The research paper introducing WordGesture-GAN won a Best Paper Honorable Mention Award at CHI 2023.
