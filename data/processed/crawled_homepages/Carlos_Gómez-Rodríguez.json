FASTPARSE Lab, LyS Research Group Department of Computer Science University of A CoruÃ±a (A CoruÃ±a, Spain), CITIC Research Center Contact: carlos.gomez@udc.es / Twitter: @carlosgr_nlp / Mastodon: @carlos@sigmoid.social NOTE: I have been awarded the National Young Researcher Price \"MarÃ­a Andresa Casamayor\" in Mathematics and Information Technologies by Spain's Ministry of Science. I have also been named an Honorary Member of the Royal Spanish Mathematical Society. Research interests: My research interests lie mainly in the field of Computational Linguistics (or Natural Language Processing). While I am excited by the revolution in the field spurred by large language models (LLMs), actively participate in the underlying debates and use them in my research, I think Natural Language Processing should not become an LLM monoculture and there also reasons to still pursue other approaches as well (e.g. efficiency, explainability, the scientific insights that can be had from computational analysis of language aside from user-facing applications, and the general principle that there is a need for breadth-first research in a landscape dominated by the depth-first outlook). My main research focus is on natural language parsing algorithms, spanning theoretical, practical and applied aspects. I am especially interested in: Techniques to improve the speed of parsing algorithms, making them practical at the Web scale. This was the focus of the ERC Starting Grant project FASTPARSE, and is still a focal point of my current research. Parsing beyond the \"easy cases\": non-projective dependency parsing (the search for parsing algorithms that can efficiently handle linguistic structures that contain crossing dependency links or, roughly equivalently, that contain discontinuous phrases), parsing morphologically-rich languages, low-resource languages, noisy text, graph parsing, etc. Cognitive aspects of syntax - how the characteristics and constraints of the human brain shape the evolution of languages, and how we can take inspiration from the human language processing system to build better automatic parsers.The use of dependency parsers for various opinion mining tasks, including polarity classification, topic classification and aspect-based sentiment analysis; and with special attention to noisy social media text (e.g. Twitter). I also have a side interest on the capabilities of LLMs for creative writing; and have addressed various other non-parsing problems as well, such as language variant identification in microtexts, text normalization, named entity recognition, generation of language resources for low-resource languages, etc. I am always open to new research subjects, ideas and collaborations.
