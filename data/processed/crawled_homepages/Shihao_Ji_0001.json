I am looking for self-motivated students with strong mathematical and programming skills to work with me on computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning projects. If interested, please read this page for details. For UConn students, you are welcome to reach out to me anytime. Short Bio I'm an Associate Professor in the School of Computing at University of Connecticut (UConn). My principal research interests lie in the area of deep learning and its applications to computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics, with an emphasis on high-performance computing. I'm interested in developing efficient algorithms that can learn from a variety of data sources (e.g., image, audio, text and time series) on large scale and automate decision-making processes in dynamic environments. I have published over 60 papers in top-ranked journals and prestigious conferences with high impact factors, including CVPR, NeurIPS, ICCV, ECCV, ICLR, ICML, AAAI, AIStats, BMVC, ECML, ICIP, IJCNN, EMNLP, SIGIR, CIKM, COLING, IEEE TPAMI, TSP, TKDE, TPDS, IEEE Internet of Things Journal etc. My research has been supported by federal agencies, including NSF, NIH, DoD, ARO, as well as industry companies, such as VMware, Cisco, Nvidia, and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Duke University, where I worked with Dr. Larry Carin. Before joining UConn, I was an Associate Professor in Computer Science at Georgia State University and Director of the DoD Center of Excellence (CiARE). Prior to returning to academia, I spent approximately 10 years in industry research labs. I am a Senior Member of the IEEE.
