Currently, he is CSE Associate Chair, the Director of the Data Mining Lab, as well as the Director of CSE Graduate Studies at the CSE Department. His research focuses on data mining & knowledge discovery, machine learning, soft computing, click fraud detection and prevention, concept drift in streaming data, and medical data mining. Dr. Kantardzic is the author of six books including the textbook: “Data Mining: Concepts, Models, Methods, and Algorithms” (John Wiley, third edition, 2019) which is accepted for data mining courses at more than hundred universities in USA and abroad, and translated into Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, and Farsi. He is the author of over 40 peer-reviewed journal publications, 20 book chapters, and more than 200 reviewed articles in the proceedings of international conferences. His recent research projects are supported by NSF, KSTC, US Treasury Department, U.S. Army, and NASA. For his contributions in data mining field, Dr. Kantardzic was elected in March 2019 for the Member of Academy of Science and Arts in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was also elected as Fulbright Specialist in Information Technology in 2012. Among his accolades are a University of Louisville Distinguished Service Award (2008), numerous Outstanding, Best, and Honorable Mention Awards for his research papers (2016, -12, -09, -07, -05, -03), and several Faculty Favorite and Distinguished Teaching Awards (2018, -12, -11, -07, -04). Dr. Kantardzic has served on the Editorial Boards for several international journals, and he is currently Associate Editor for WIREs Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Journal. He was a reviewer and panel member for NSF, KSEF-SBIR, NASA, the Austrian Science Foundation (ASF), the Canadian Research Council (NSERC), Croatian UKF Fund, RAND NPRP, Chilean Science Foundation, National Science Center in Poland, and Norman Hackerman Advanced Research Program (NHARP). He was invited keynote speaker at conferences in USA, Mexico, Bosnia, Egypt, Japan, India, and Algeria, and his service activities include a General Chair or Program Chair assignments for several international conferences including IEEE ICMLA 2018, HICSS’17, GOCICT 2016, HICSS’16, INSS-BigData’15, IEEE ICAT’13, ICMLA’09, IEEE ISSPIT’08, and WSIPT’07.EducationB.S. in Electrical Engineering, University of Sarajevo, 1972M.S. in Computer Science, University of Sarajevo, 1976Ph.D. in Computer Science, University of Sarajevo, 1980Publications<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\">Dynamic modelling with integrated concept drift detection for predicting real-time energy consumption of industrial machines</span>- 2022 Additional Publications Journal ArticlesTurner, J., Kantardzic, M. & Vickers-Smith, R.
