I'm happy to discuss ideas and opportunities that fit the scope of ongoing research. Please, read this first: Richard Hamming, \"You and your research\" (Jamie Callan says this is for senior researchers, but I still recommend this for young minds, like mine was at the time I read it :) ).

Biography JoÃ£o MagalhÃ£es (PhD, Imperial College London, UK, 2008) is a Full Professor at the Department of Computer Science at the Universidade NOVA de Lisboa. His research interests cover the different problems of vision and language understanding, in particular: foundational vision and language models, multimedia search, multimodal conversational AI, and multimodal temporal models. He has coordinated and participated in several research projects, where he aims to generalize his vision and language research to solve real-world problems across different domains. The work of his group has been awarded or nominated for several awards and distinctions: in 2023 and 2022 his group was awarded the 1st place and 2nd place respectively in the Amazon Science Alexa TaskBot Challenge, a conversational AI challenge to incorporate multimodal (voice and vision) user data, in 2020 a best paper award at the Portuguese NLP conference (PROPOR), in 2018 two nominations for best paper at ACM Intâl Conference on the Theory of Information Retrieval and at ACM Intâl Conference in Multimedia Retrieval. | CSS | XHTML 1.1 | July 1, 2022",
