Over the next few years, I will be working as a Program Director for the CSR (Computer Systems Research) program within the CNS (Computer and Network Systems) Division in CISE Directorate. SHORT BIO Shivakant Mishra is a professor in the Department of Computer Science at The University of Colorado, Boulder. He is the site co-director of the NSF IUCRC (Industry University Cooperative Research Center) on Pervasive Personalized Intelligence. He co-founded The Colorado Research Center for Democracy and Technology as well as The CU CyberSafety Research Center at CU-Boulder. He serves as a member of the CU Honor Code Advisory Board, Boulder Faculty Assembly and the newly formed Faculty Governance Council in the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences. He served as associate chair of the Computer Science Department as chairs of the undergraduate or graduate programs for over 20 years. He was the General Chair of The 47th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2017) and The First and Second International Workshop on Computational Methods for CyberSafety (CyberSafety 2016. And CyberSafety 2017) which he co-founded. He has also served as the Program Committee Chair/Co-Chair of CyberSafety 2020, CyberSafety 2018 and MobiCASE 2014. He enjoys doing research in Distributed Computing & Networking as well as in Social Computing. His current research includes developing system-level support for quantum computing and edge computing, building socio-technical systems to empower environmental justice communities, strengthening democracy through technology, and investigating cybersafety issues in social networks. In the past, he has conducted extensive research in the areas of mobile group recommendations, cyberbullying in social networks, misbehavior detection in online video chat systems, multiplayer online game analytics, secure and intrusion-tolerant sensor networks, delay-tolerant networking, and group communication systems. He teaches systems courses both at the undergraduate and graduate levels. These include Computer Systems and Operating Systems at the undergraduate level and Distributed Systems, Computer Networks and Advanced Operating Systems at the graduate level. In addition, he has taught several special topics courses including Strengthening Democracy through Technology, Sustainable Computing, and Dependable Distributed Systems.
