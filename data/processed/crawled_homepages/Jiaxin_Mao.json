I am now a pre-tenure associate professor at the Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China. Before that, I worked as a postdoctoral research fellow and obtained my Ph.D. degree at the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University under the supervision of Prof. Shaoping Ma and Prof. Yiqun Liu. My research focuses on Information Retrieval, Web Search, and Applied Machine Learning. I am particularly interested in how people interact with the massive amount of information on the Web, so I focus on User Behavior Analysis for different information systems, such as search engines, recommender systems, and AI chatbots. Recently, I have also become interested in building effective and efficient dense retrieval models for ad hoc search.I am the ACM SIGIR Student Affairs Co-Chair since 2018 and served as an ACM SIGIR Student Liaison during 2017-2018, please contact me if you have any questions about SIGIR-student matters. I also served as a reviewer and SPC/PC member for TOIS, TKDE, JASIST, SIGIR, WWW, WSDM, AAAI, CIKM, EMNLP-IJCNLP, ECIR, NLPCC, and CCIR.Professional Experience:2023~Now  Renmin University of China, Pre-tenure Associate Professor2020~2023  Renmin University of China, Assistant Professor2018~2020 Tsinghua University, Post-doc Research FellowEducation:2013~2018  Ph.D.      Computer Science, Tsinghua University2009~2013  B.E.        Computer Science, Tsinghua UniversityContact info and some useful links:E-mail: maojiaxin AT {gmail.com, ruc.edu.cn}Official Homepage in Chinese: https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/maojiaxintwitter: maojiaxinweibo: defaultstr9google scholar: Jiaxin MaoACM DL profile: Jiaxin MaoNews:I serve as one of the PC Chairs of SIGIR-AP 2024.
