Prior to coming to AUEB I was an Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Riverside and a Research Scientist at Hewlett-Packard Labs in Palo Alto, CA. I received my PhD from the University of California, Santa Barbara. I hold an M.S. and a B.S. from the University of Crete, Greece. Prof. Kalogeraki has been working in the field of distributed and real-time systems, big data systems, cloud computing, human-centered systems, participatory sensing, crowdsourcing, resource management and fault-tolerance for over 25 years. She has published over 200 papers with students and colleagues, at top Journals in her area (IEEE TPDS, ACM TOS, IEEE TKDE, ACM TOSN, JSS, ISJ, with average impact factor 3), as well as at the most prestigious and selective conferences in her area (RTSS, DSN, IPDPS, ICDCS, VLDB, Middleware, MDM), including co-authoring the OMG CORBA Dynamic Scheduling Standard. She has published 4 patents. These publications have been widely cited. She has developed real systems that are being used by other researchers and practitioners. She has been invited to give keynote talks at CLOSER2023, PerFoT2018, MoVid2015, DNCMS 2012, SN2AE 2012, PETRA 2011, DBISP2P 2006 and MLSN 2006 in the areas of Edge Computing, IoT, participatory sensing systems and sensor middleware and delivered tutorials and seminars on peer-to-peer computing. She has served as the General Chair or co- Chair of EuroSys 2024, GEC 2023, GEC 2022, MDM 2021, SEUS 2009 and WPDRTS 2006 and as a Program co-Chair of Mobiquitous 2023, ACSOS 2021, DASFAA 2021, Middleware 2019, MDM 2017, DEBS 2016, MUD 2014, MDM 2011, ISORC 2009, ISORC 2007, ICPS 2005, WPDRTS 2005 and DBISP2P 2003, a Tutorial Chair for IEEE ICDE 2020, ACM DEBS 2015, a Workshops Chair for IEEE SRDS 2015, a Demo Chair for IEEE MDM 2012, in addition to other roles such as Area Chair (IEEE ICDCS 2016, 2012). Finally, she has provided extensive service and leadership in the technical community, through her very frequent participation in program committees of the premier conferences in the field and as program committee member on over 200 conferences. She has also served as Editor in four journals. Prof. Kalogeraki was also awarded a Marie Curie Fellowship, three best paper awards at the 11th ACM International Conference on Distributed Event-Based Systems (DEBS 2017), 24th IEEE In-ternational Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS 2009) and the 9th IEEE Annual International Symposium on Applications and the Internet (SAINT 2008), a best poster award at EuroSys 2024, a best technical paper award at ACM PETRA 2018, a Best Student Paper Award at the 11th IEEE/IPSJ International Symposium on Applications and the Internet (SAINT 2011), an IBM best student paper award runner up at MDM 2014, a UC Regents Fellowship Award, UC Academic Senate Research Awards and a research award from HP Labs. She has received an Award for Excellence in Teaching (academic year 2018-2019) from the Department of Informatics, Athens University of Economics and Business. Her research has been supported by an ERC Starting Independent Researcher Grant, the European Union, joint EU/Greek \"Aristeia\" grant, a joint EU/Greek \"Thalis\" grant, NSF and gifts from SUN and Nokia. Prof. Kalogeraki has led or participated in 25 Research Awards and Projects. Her research has been supported by an ERC Starting Independent Researcher (Consolidator) Grant, the European Union, joint EU/Greek \"Aristeia\" grant, a joint EU/Greek \"Thalis\" grant, NSF and gifts from SUN and Nokia. Currently she is supervising 4 PhD students, 6 MS students and 2 Undergraduates. She has graduated 10 Ph.D. students (hold academic positions in Europe or work at top industry and research labs including IBM, Google, Microsoft and Akamai) and has served on PhD/MS Committee for over 60 MS and PhD students.
