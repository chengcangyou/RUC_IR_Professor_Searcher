Please always cc my gmail address, too.dblp, google scholar, orcid, youtube[I am not on any social media]My name is Amir Kafshdar Goharshady. I always prefer to be called by my first name, especially if you are a student sending me an email. I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Oxford and a Fellow of St Catherine's College (affectionately known as Catz). I am also fortunate to lead the ALPACAS research group, an amazing team of talented young mathematicians and computer scientists. My research interests are in theoretical computer science, specifically formal program verification, parametrised algorithms, compiler optimisation and blockchain.My educational background is, unsurprisingly, at the intersection of Mathematics and Computer Science. I did my PhD in Theoretical Computer Science at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria, where I was highly privileged to be supervised by Prof. Krishnendu Chatterjee. I also have an MSc in Computer Science (Systems) from Georgia Tech and did my undergraduate studies in Maths and Computing at the Universities of London and Yazd. Prior to joining Oxford, I was an Assistant Professor of Computing and Mathematics at HKUST. Google SitesReport abuseGoogle SitesReport abuse",
