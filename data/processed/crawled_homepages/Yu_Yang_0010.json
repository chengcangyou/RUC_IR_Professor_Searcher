I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Rutgers University. My research focuses on the interaction between humans and real-world systems, particularly Cyber-Physical Systems and the Internet of Things (IoT). I develop machine learning models to understand human behavior from multisensory data and use these insights to inform the design and optimization of such systems. My work has been evaluated and deployed in domains such as intelligent transportation systems, logistics, the on-demand gig economy, last-mile mobility, and smart cities. I am actively looking for motivated graduate/undergraduate/visiting students to work in my lab. Please email me your CV and all the transcripts if you are interested.
