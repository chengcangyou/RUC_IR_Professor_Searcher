After working as a post-doc for 18 months in Broadband and Wireless Networking Lab at Georgia Institute of Technology, I was appointed as a visiting professor at Georgia Institute of Technology - Savannah Campus for two years. Currently, I am a professor in the Department of Computer Engineering at Boğaziçi University. I am a faculty member of the Computer Networks Research Lab (NetLab). I also take part in Telecommunications and Informatics Technologies Research Center (TETAM) in Kandilli Campus of Boğaziçi University and the associated TAM project funded by the State Planning Organization of Turkey (DPT). My research interests include wireless networks, with the emphasis on Cognitive Radio and 5G Networks, as well as Molecular Communications and NanoNetworking. You may follow the \"Research\" link on the left for my past and present projects. Highlights You may access directly to our emulators (developed by my students) on several topics in Molecular Communications by following the links below. You may run the emulators with the default parameters or you may modify the parameters as you wish. Emulator for Communication via Diffusion (CvD) & Brownian Motion (thanks to Sinan Narmanlı & Murat Güvenç) Emulator for Calcium Signaling (thanks to Sinan Narmanlı & Murat Güvenç) Emulator for Neuromuscular Junctions (NMJ) (thanks to Helin Ece Akgül) Emulator for Protrusions (thanks to Helin Ece Akgül) Also, you may find a simple emulator that explains how instructions are executed in the CPU. This emulator was developed by a high school student, Oktay Çomu from Robert College. It aims to give a broad sense of instruction execution; it does not show exact instruction execution process. It starts with a default set of instructions loaded in the memory cells, but you may modify them by changing the content of the cells in the lower left.

The drawback to this solution is that the histogram of the molecules’ hitting times, which constitute the molecular signal at the receiver, has a heavy tail. Reducing the effects of this heavy tail, inter-symbol interference (ISI), has been the focus of most prior research. In this paper, a novel way of decreasing the ISI by defining a counting region on the spherical receiver’s surface facing toward the transmitter node is proposed. The beneficial effect comes from the fact that the molecules received from the back lobe of the receiver are more likely to be coming through longer paths that contribute to ISI. In order to justify this idea, the joint distribution of the arrival molecules with respect to angle and time is derived. Using this distribution, the channel model function is approximated for the proposed system, i.e., the partially counting absorbing spherical receiver. After validating the channel model function, the characteristics of the molecular signal are investigated and improved performance is presented. Moreover, the optimal counting region in terms of bit error rate is found analytically.

The aim of the course is to teach how the components of a computer system interact with the specific focus on operating systems. We study the basic OS concepts like process management, memory management, and storage management. Lecture notes and additional material is available to registered students of the course via BOUN-Moodle.

Students registered for the course may access the lecture notes via BOUN-Moodle. Terms Spring'08 Spring'09 Spring'10 Spring'11 Spring'12 Spring'13 Spring'14 Spring'15 Spring'16 CMPE59G - NanoNetworking Though nanotechnology has been a hot topic for nearly a decade, nano-machines are still far from achieving complicated tasks. Therefore, collaborative operation of nano-machines is a must for nanotechnology. Nanonetworking, i.e., communication between nano-machines, is an emerging technology that enables communication at the nanoscale. This course aims introducing concepts and research topics on communications and networking issues among nano-machines. We will cover nanoscale communication networks ranging from molecular motors for intra-cell communication to diffusion and gap junctions for inter-cell communications. We will also have a brief look at carbon nanotube-based nanonetworks. Our focus will be mostly on bio-hybrid approaches. Lecture notes and additional material is available to registered students of the course via BOUN-Moodle.
