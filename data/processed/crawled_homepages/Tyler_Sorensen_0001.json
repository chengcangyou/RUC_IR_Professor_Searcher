I am currently taking a leave to work in the RiSE group at Microsoft Research. Many of my academic activities will be paused during this time. My research interests are in concurrency: programming, modeling, testing, and architecture. In particular, I am interested in exploring new programming models that enable development of correct and efficient applications on interesting (i.e. new or emerging) architectures. I see GPGPU programming as pragmatic avenue to explore different ideas in concurrency (and also programming GPUs is fun!). Given this, much of my work is framed using GPGPU. I am an invited individual contributer to the Khronos Group (Sponsored by Google) where we think about how to evolve official standards. Previously, I was a Post Doc at Princeton working in Margaret Martonosi’s group. I received my PhD from the Multicore Programming Group at Imperial College London supervised by Alastair Donaldson. Even earlier, I worked with Ganesh Gopalakrishnan and Zvonimir Rakamaric at University of Utah for my undergad and MS. Interests Concurrency - semantics, testing, verification Heterogeneous Systems - GPUs, accelerators Compilers - portability, optimizations Education PhD in Computer Science, 2018 Imperial College London MS in Computer Science, 2014 University of Utah BSc in Computer Science, 2012 University of Utah Students Phd Students Reese Levine - Started Fall 2020 Yanwen Xu - Started Spring 2021 Rithik Sharma - Started Fall 2022 Jessica Dagostini - Started Fall 2022 (co-advised with Scott Beamer) Devon McKee - Started Spring 2023 MS Students Zheyuan Chen Sanya Srivastava Gurpreet Dhillon Undergrad Students Albert Lee, Shaan Mistry, Sean Siddens Alumni Kyle Little - UG, now a PhD student at University of Utah Alec Siegel - MS, now at centric software Christian Lei - MS, now at Microsoft Kiefer Selmon - MS, now at Nvidia Mingun Cho - undergrad, now a PhD student at UCD Tianhao Guo - undergrad, now an MS student at NYU Chris Liu - undergrad, now a PhD student at UCLA Teaching I teach classes at UCSC on compilers and parallel programming.
