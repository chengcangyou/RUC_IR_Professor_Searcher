My main research interests are function approximation, the evaluation of oscillatory integrals and the simulation of oscillatory integral equations, with an emphasis on wave problems from acoustics and electromagnetics. Before that I was a postdoctoral fellow of FWO-Flanders. From April until July 2009 I was a David Crighton Fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics of the University of Cambridge. In 2006 I completed a PhD, under the supervision of Prof. Stefan Vandewalle. In 2009 I received a Leslie Fox Prize (in Warwick, UK) and a New Talent Award (SciCADE'09, Beijing) for my research on the Fourier extension problem. In 2008 I was awarded the SIAM Richard C. DiPrima prize at SIAM's annual meeting 2008 for my phd research on oscillatory integral equations. I am an associate editor of the IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis.",
