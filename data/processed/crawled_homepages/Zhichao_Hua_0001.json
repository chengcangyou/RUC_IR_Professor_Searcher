I received my Ph.D. degree in computer science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2020. My research area includes the agent OS, system for LLM and heterogeneous systems. Teaching CS3601 Operating System （2022 fall, 2023 fall, 2024 fall, 2025 fall) EI6711 Advanced Operating System （2024 spring, 2025 spring) Professional Services TPC of APSys 2025 TPC of SysTEX 2025 TPC of SIGOPS ChinaSys 2024 Transaction Reviewer of Journal of Systems Architecture: Embedded Software Design Transaction Reviewer of CCF Transactions on High Performance Computing Research Interests HW/SW Co-Design for System Isolation I use hardware-software co-design to build a more efficient isolation framework for the operating system. For kernel-level isolation, I propose ISA-Grid[ISCA'23] to construct bit-level isolation domains for instructions and registers, which isolate different kernel components and kernel modules. I also propose EPTI[ATC'18] to isolate the kernel of unpatched VMs from user-level Meltdown attacks using the Intel VMFUNC instruction. For user-level isolation, I propose TZ-Container[SCIS'21] to isolate containers from untrusted OS with ARM TrustZone. I introduce CPS[ASPLOS'23] to make VM isolation more efficient in many core systems. I also propose XPC[ISCA'19] and its follow-up work [TOCS'22] to provide fast cross-domain call extensions and to speed up the IPC (Inter-Procedure Call) for existing OSes. Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) I focus on building practical TEE systems and their applications. I first try to enable high-performance TEEs in more scenarios using legacy hardware. For the virtualization environment, I propose vTZ[Security'2017], which is the first secure virtualization system for ARM TrustZone, to enable TrustZone for each VM. The SGXMigration[DSN'2017] is proposed to securely migrate a VM, together with its TEEs. For the OS kernel, I propose COLONY[TC'22] to construct TEE instances at the kernel level to protect OS services. For the heterogeneous environment, I propose XpuTEE(TOCS'25) to build TEEs across CPU and GPU. Based on these TEEs, I have built various high-performance secure systems, such as decentralized file systems, data sharing systems, and LLM inference systems.
