Before that, I completed a Ph.D. at the Computer Science Department at Stanford University in 2007, where I worked with Zohar Manna. I did a short post-doc with Luca de Alfaro in 2007 before joining IMDEA. In 2012 I was granted tenure and promoted to Associate Professor at the IMDEA Software Institute and in 2023 I was promoted to Full Professor. I graduated with a degree in Telecommunication Engineering from Universidad PolitÃ©cnica de Madrid in 1999. Then I moved to Stanford where I obtained a M.S. in Computer science in 2001 and then a Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2006. I do research in formal methods, and in general in rigorous techniques for the design, implementation, verification and understanding of computational devices, mostly software. Most of my work is rooted in the areas of automata, game theory and logic, and particularly in the intersection of these areas.
