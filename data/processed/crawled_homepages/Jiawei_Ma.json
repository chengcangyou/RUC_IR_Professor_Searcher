Before my doctorate program, I work on computational imaging and am fortunate to be instructed by Prof. Xin Yuan in Westlake University. I can speak English, Chinese and a bit Korean. Open Positions (New) I am going to join the Department of Computer Science at City University of Hong Kong as a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor in 2024 Fall, and building my research team, Statistics & Machine Learning (SMILE) Labortary. For the academic year of 2024~2025, we have several openings for Ph.D. students and Postdocs, and also welcome various forms of collaboration. Please refer to Labortary and Join Us for detailed information regarding research direction and application instruction. Research Interest My research focuses on Machine Learning and Computer vision, with the aim to develop general-purpose intelligent visual system for real-world application. Specifically, my research considers the learning mechanisms for effective and continuous knowledge update with minimal manual curation (e.g., data-centric AI, de-centralized AI), as well as explainable representation that can encode complex raw signals and be robustly applied in diverse tasks & fields (e.g., AI agent, AI for science).
