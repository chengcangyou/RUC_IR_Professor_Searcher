Twitter Google Scholar LinkedIn Github Sorry, you need Javascript on. About Me I am an assistant professor in Thomas Lord Department of Computer Science and, by courtesy, in Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Southern California. I lead the Learning and Interactive Robot Autonomy Lab (Lira Lab). Broadly, I am interested in artificial intelligence for robotics. In my research, I use tools from machine learning, artificial intelligence, optimization, game theory, robotics, information theory, and cognitive science. Specifically, I work on robot learning from humans, human-robot collaboration, and learning in multi-agent systems. Prior to joining USC, I was a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley's CHAI, working with Prof. Stuart Russell and Prof. Anca Dragan. I completed my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. I was advised by Prof. Dorsa Sadigh in Intelligent and Interactive Autonomous Systems Group (ILIAD). I spent Summer 2021 as a research intern at Google, working with Dr. Yinlam Chow, Dr. Mohammad Ghavamzadeh, and Prof. Craig Boutilier. I got my B.Sc. degree in electrical and electronics engineering at Bilkent University, where I conducted research in Prof. Tolga Çukur's lab.",
