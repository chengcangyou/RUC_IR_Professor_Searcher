Follow @yuxiangw_cs Looking for self-motivated students and postdocs. Welcome Hello! Welcome to my homepage. I am a faculty member of the HalÄ±cÄ±oÄlu Data Science Institute at UC San Diego, also affliated with the CSE department. Prior to joining UCSD, I was with the Computer Science Department at UCSB from 2018-2023, where I started the S2ML lab and co-founded the Center for Responsible Machine Learning . Even before that I was a scientist at Amazon AI in Palo Alto from 2017-2018 after obtaining my PhD from the Machine Learning department at CMU. So what do we do in S2ML lab? Broadly speaking, my students and I apply math and computing to (1) design faster, stronger and more efficient ML algorithms with provable guarantees (2) solve societal challenges (e.g., data privacy, abuse prevention) that emerge in the AI era. Our recent focus include watermarking generative AI, making differential privacy practical, bridging offline and online RL, developing a theory of adaptivity in deep learning. On the application front, I am particularly interested in healthcare and financial markets.

Congratulations to S2ML students, alumni and collaborators. May 2024: Six papers accepted to ICML'24, covering new advances in differential privacy (private selection, neural collapse theory, parameter-efficient DP finetuning), multi-agent RL (low-adaptivity, improved sample complexity), and dynamic pricing with with contextual elasticity. Congratulations to S2ML students, alumni and collaborators. Mar 2024: I transferred to UCSD. From Goleta to La Jolla, S2ML Lab will continue to produce good research and nurture the next-generation leaders in ML.",
