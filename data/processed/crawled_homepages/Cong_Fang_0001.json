I was a postdoctoral researcher at University of Pennsylvania, hosted by Prof. Weijie Su and Qi Long in 2021, and at Princeton University hosted by Prof. Jason D. Lee in 2020. I received my Ph.D. at Peking Univerity, advised by Prof. Zhouchen Lin. I also work closely with Prof. Tong Zhang at UIUC. My research interests are broadly in the machine learning algorithms and theory. I currently work on various aspects of optimization and the foundation of deep learning. The topics include, but are not limited to, Optimization and Sampling: convex and non-convex opt., stochastic opt., distributed/federated opt., min-max opt., gradient based sampling, etc. I focus on building more realistic mathematical foundation for solvers on machine learning models and designing faster algorithms. Deep Learning Theory: complexity analysis, feature/representation learning analysis, implicit regularization, etc. I am interested in proposing new models or analyses to have a better theoretical understanding of machine learning models, including neural networks. AI Foundation: data driven causal learning without prior knowledge, understand the emergence of value and rules, etc. I am interested in propose new theoretic frameworks and methodologies to read high-level AI. Applications : new architectures/code package, LLM Training, efficient methods to collect and use data. I am recruiting self-motivated Ph.D. and interns who have strong mathematical abilities or coding skills to work with me (you do not need to come from mathematics department). If you are interested, please send your detailed CV to my email. You can be also co-advised by Prof. Zhouchen Lin and may have the opportunity to work with my other advisors, in particular Prof. Tong Zhang and Weijie Su.
