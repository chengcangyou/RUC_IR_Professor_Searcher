Feb. 2, 2023 New year, new project I am lucky to start the new year with an exciitng new project called âPAPACUI: Proficiency Awareness in Physical ACtivity User Interfacesâ. The project comes with funding from the Swedish Research Council Starting Grant. This means that I am actively looking for a PhD student at the moment. Do let me know if you know someone who could be interested.
