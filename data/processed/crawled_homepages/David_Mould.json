I once spent a lot of time on approximate path planning and I still use path planning techniques in my computer graphics research. You can read about my group and our activities at the GIGL site, which is more carefully maintained than this one. I received my PhD from the University of Toronto in 2002. My academic lineage includes Euler, Leibniz, and other giants of mathematics. I was a faculty member at the University of Saskatchewan, in Saskatoon, from 2002 to 2008. Since 2008, I have been on the faculty in the School of Computer Science at Carleton University, in Ottawa.
