Currently, he is working on data streams,approximate query processing, spatial data processing, probabilistic queries, Graph Databases and web information processing.Graph visualization is to display a graph according to the aesthetics from applications; for example, one may wish to draw a graph symmetrically if possible. Graph visualization serves as a tool in many applications. A number of topic have been covered by Xuemin Lin in graph drawing, which include drawing trees, undirected graphs, directed graphs and hierarchical graphs. Xuemin Lin's main focus has been on understanding inherent difficulties of drawing problems and then developing effective drawing algorithms. Fold Teaching Fold",
