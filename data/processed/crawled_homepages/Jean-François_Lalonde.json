Since 2022, I am also the associate scientific director of the IID (Institute Intelligence and Data). I became Associate academic member at Mila in 2025. I grew up in QuÃ©bec City, Canada, lived almost 10 years in the States and have been back in this beautiful city since 2013. I obtained my Ph.D. in 2011 from the Robotics Institute, in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by Alyosha Efros and Srinivas Narasimhan. I then spent a year as a Computer Vision Scientist at Tandent, Inc., followed by another year as a Post-Doc at Disney Research, Pittsburgh. I do research in computer vision, machine learning, AR and VR. In particular, I am interested in exploring how physics-based models and data-driven machine learning techniques can be combined to better understand, model, interpret, and recreate the richness of our visual world. See here for a more âofficialâ bio. Iâve been fortunate to count this amazing group of people as my students. My group has captured some of the largest datasets of HDR illumination, both indoors and outdoors, freely available to academic researchers. Get them here. Want to know more?
