I am Professor in the Applied Statistics Unit of the Indian Statitical Institute, Kolkata in India. My main research area in Symmetric Cryptography. My research focusses on cryptographic algorithms and security analysis. I did B.Stat (1999) and M.Stat (2001) and Ph.D (2005) from Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. Before joining Indian Statistical Institute, I was a Post-doc fellow in the CACR, Waterloo University (worked with Professor Douglas Stinson), Scientist in IPN, CINVESTAV, Mexico, visiting researcher in National Institute of Standard and Technology and George Washington University, USA.
