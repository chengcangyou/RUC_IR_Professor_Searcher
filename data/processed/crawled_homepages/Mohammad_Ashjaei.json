I am affiliated with the Complex Real-Time Embedded Systems (CORE) and the Heterogeneous Systems - Hardware Software Co-design (HERO) research groups. I have received my PhD degree in Computer Science and Engineering from MDU (back then MDH) in November 2016, and after that until April 2020 I was an associate researcher at MDU. My doctoral dissertation is on resource reservation for industrial switched Ethernet networks. Research: Since May 2020 I am a senior lecturer at MDU in the area of data communication for embedded systems. I have received my docent diploma in Dec 2021. My main focus of research is on resource reservation in communication, where the communication can be in different context, such as automation networks, automotive networks, as well as cloud and fog communication infrastructures. I am also interested in predictability analysis, design configuration, dynamic and adaptive configurations, and software development of real-time communication networks in various domains. I have worked (and still working) in several research projects in different roles that can be found in the \"Projects\" section. Main applicant of the in-progress project:FLEXATION: 2024-2027 Co-applicant of the in-progress projects:iSecure: 2023-2026SEINE: 2023-2026AORTA: 2023-2025PROVIDENT: 2020-2024INTERCONNECT: 2021-2025 Co-applicant of the finished projects: FIESTA: 2019-2023DESTINE: 2019-2021 Member of the following projects: MARC - Mälardalen University Automation Research CenterXPRES - Excellence in Production Research  Teaching: Besides research I am teaching topics related to data communications in various bachelor and master courses. I have lectures in embedded systems courses, such as data communication for embedded systems, embedded systems I, embedded systems II, and distance course in IoT fundamentals. I have also given several guest lectures in Porto University, Aveiro University, Eindhoven University of Technology, Volvo Construction Equipment, HIAB, to name some.Community services: I am a reviewer for many international journals and conferences including RTS, TII, TIE, TECS, WFCS, RTAS, DATE, ETFA, ISORC, IECON and INDIN. Program chair for topic E2 at Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference (DATE), 2026.PC co-chair of the 21st IEEE Internation Conference on Factory Communication Systems (WFCS), 2025.Co-chair of the Track on Real-Time Systems and Applications of the 28th International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA), 2024.Publicity co-chair of the 20th IEEE International Conference on Factory Communication Systems (WFCS), 2024.Co-organizer and co-chair of the 5th Workshop on Advanced Technologies in Industrial Vehicular Systems (DIVERSE) located at the 26th International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA), 2023Co-General chair of the 26th International Symposium on Real-Time Distributed Computing (ISORC) 2023 to be held in Nashville, USA.Co-chair of the Track on Real-Time (and Networked) Embedded Systems of the 27th International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA), 2023.Co-chair of the Track on Real-Time (and Networked) Embedded Systems of the 26th International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA), 2022.Program Committee Co-chair of the 25th International Symposium on Real-Time Distributed Computing (ISORC) 2022 to be held in Västerås, Sweden.Co-chair of the Track on Real-Time (and Networked) Embedded Systems of the 26th International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA), 2021Treasure chair of 26th International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA), 2021Co-organizer and co-chair of the 4th Workshop on Advanced Technologies in Industrial Vehicular Systems (DIVERSE) located at the 26th International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA), 2022Co-organizer and co-chair of the 3rd Workshop on Advanced Technologies in Industrial Vehicular Systems (DIVERSE) located at the 26th International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA), 2021Co-chair of the Special Session on Adaptive and Reconfigurable Cyber-Physical Systems at the 25th International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA), 2020Co-organizer and co-chair of the 2nd Workshop on Advanced Technologies in Industrial Vehicular Systems (DIVERSE) located at the 25th International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA), 2020Co-chair of the Special Session on Adaptive and Reconfigurable Cyber-Physical Systems at the 24th International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA), 2019Co-organizer and co-chair of the 1st Workshop on Advanced Technologies in Industrial Vehicular Systems (DIVERSE) located at the 24th International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA), 2019Since May 2020 I am a senior lecturer at MDU in the area of data communication for embedded systems.
