I am member of the theory group. Before joining NCSU, I was a postdoc at Harvard University from 2021–2023 and Columbia University from 2019–2021. I received my PhD at Northeastern University, and my Masters and Bachelor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). Research interests: Theoretical Computer Science — randomness in computation, pseudorandomness, Boolean functions. If you’re an NCSU student interested in doing research with me, you’ll need to take a course with me first — GPA doesn’t matter. Note that my research requires a strong background in discrete math and basic probability. This Fall semester, I am organizing a weekly reading group on randomness in computing. See here for more details.
