I am also affiliated with the Department of Computer Science. I am generally interested in computer systems and security with a special focus on commodity hardware and operating systems. My collaborators and I have received many awards for our research over the years. These include distinguished and best paper awards at IEEE S&P, USENIX Security and MICRO (among others), and five Pwnies, four for the most innovative research. My research was also awarded two early-career personal grants (a Dutch Veni and an ERC Starting) and the Jochen Liedtke young researcher award. ETH students seem to think we are good at teaching and gave us the Golden Owl award in 2022. Teaching Computer Engineering, BSc, 2022 – 2025. Hardware Security, MSc, 2016 – 2025.
