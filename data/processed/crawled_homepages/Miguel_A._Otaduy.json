With these models, I create simulations for computer animation or virtual reality, but also innovative solutions for applications as diverse as fashion, virtual touch, medicine, or robotics. I have received two major excellence research grants in Europe: ERC Consolidator Grant (2017), ERC Starting Grant (2011). I am professor of computer science at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos since 2008. I hold a BS (2000) in Electrical Engineering from Mondragon University, and MS (2003) and PhD (2004) in Computer Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. From 2005 to 2008 I was a senior researcher at the Computer Graphics Laboratory at ETH Zurich. In 2022 I joined Meta Reality Labs Research as research scientist. In 2017 I co-founded SEDDI for the development of innovative digital solutions for the textile and fashion industries, and I was its Chief Science Officer until 2022. Our lab at URJC is incubating CLAP for natural interaction with our hands in XR. I enjoy sharing my passion for computer animation with young students and researchers. I teach at our BS degree on game design and development, and our MS degree on computer graphics. If you are interested in a PhD or postdoc in the field of simulation in computer graphics, talk to me.",
