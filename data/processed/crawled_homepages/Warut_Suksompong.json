Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in computer science at the University of Oxford, hosted by Edith Elkind. I completed my PhD at Stanford University, where my advisor was Tim Roughgarden, and received my bachelor's and master's degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My research interests include algorithmic game theory, computational social choice, mechanism design, and other problems at the interface between computer science, economics, mathematics, and operations research. News: I will be presenting a survey on \"Voting in Divisible Settings\" in the Senior Member Presentation Track of AAAI 2026. Please feel free to join! I received a Faculty Teaching Excellence Award in the NUS School of Computing in 2023, 2024, and 2025, and have been placed on the Honor Roll. I received an Outstanding Program Committee Member Award at ECAI 2025 (29 out of 2253 program committee members).
