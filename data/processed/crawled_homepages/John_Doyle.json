Not much math. Mostly. Everything is in this dropbox folder: Dropbox folder It's not very well organized but there are a variety of subfolders with videos, slides, and papers. Download the videos or they will run in preview mode and terminate early. The overarching theme is universal laws and architectures, with an emphasis on theoretical foundations, and applications to complex networks in tech, bio, neuro, med, eco, cyberphys, and societies. Central concepts are laws/layers/levels, virtualization, robust-efficiency and speed-accuracy tradeoffs (SATs), diversity-enabled sweet spots (DeSS), bowtie and hourglass, evolvability, horizontal transfer, virality, SLSDNQD (sparse, local, saturating, delayed, noisy, quantized, distributed) in sense\\comms|compute/actuate control system components. As usual, analysis is more advanced than synthesis, though progress on synthesis has been dramatic in recent years particularly due to System Level Synthesis (SLS). Brief Bio John Doyle is the Jean-Lou Chameau Professor of Control and Dynamical Systems, Electrical Engineer, and BioEngineering at Caltech, and received the BS&MS in EE, MIT (1977), and PhD in Math, UC Berkeley (1984)). He was a consultant at Honeywell Systems and Research Center from 1976 to 1990. Research is on mathematical foundations for complex networks with applications in biology, technology, medicine, ecology, neuroscience, and multiscale physics that integrates theory from control, computation, communication, optimization, statistics (e.g. Machine Learning). An emphasis on universal laws and architectures, robustness/efficiency and speed/accuracy tradeoffs, adaptability, and evolvability and large scale systems. Control with sparse, local, delayed, saturating, quantized, uncertain sensing, communications, computing, and actuation using System Level Synthesis. Early work was on robustness of feedback control systems with applications to aerospace and process control. His students and research group developed software packages like the Matlab Robust Control Toolbox and the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). Prizes, awards, records, championships include the 1990 IEEE Baker Prize (for all IEEE publications), also listed in the world top 10 “most important\" papers in mathematics 1981-1993, IEEE Automatic Control Transactions Award (x3 1998, 1999,2021), 1994 AACC American Control Conference Schuck Award, 2004 ACM Sigcomm Paper Prize and 2016 “test of time” award, and inclusion in Best Writing on Mathematics 2010. Individual awards include 1977 IEEE Power Hickernell, 1983 AACC Eckman, 1984 UC Berkeley Friedman, 1984 IEEE Centennial Outstanding Young Engineer (a one-time award for IEEE 100th anniversary), and 2004 IEEE Control Systems Field Award. Best known for the shortest abstract in IEEE history, and fabulous friends, partner, colleagues, and students. Has held world and national records and championships in various sports, but is otherwise quite fragile.
