Computer systems are becoming smaller, faster, pervasive, ubiquitous, mobile, connected, adaptable, and \"smart\". We are increasingly becoming dependent on their correct operation. Yet, developing correct systems is challenging. The goal of my research is to help developing, testing, and verifying complex computer systems through automation. My primary focus areas are Automated Program Analysis, Software Model Checking, Automated Reasoning, and Abstract Interpretation. See my CV for information on recent research projects and Tools for current tools. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family, photography, and mountain sports, ... Prospective Students I am looking for highly-motivated PhD and MSc students interested in logic, automated reasoning, formal methods, programming, and software engineering. Please contact me with your transcript and resume, or list my name as a potential supervisor in the official application so that it comes to my attention. I do my best to answer all emails, but it is not always possible.
