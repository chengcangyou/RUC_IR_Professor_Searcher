Nicolosi is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Stevens Institute of Technology. His research focuses on cryptography and its applications to resolving issues of security and privacy in distributed systems. Highlights include fast authentication mechanisms for data forwardingin a future Internet architecture and a novel approach to non-commutative cryptography.Dr. Nicolosi's research is been funded in part by grants from the National Science Foundation, including a 2014 NSF CAREER award.Before joining Stevens in 2007, Nicolosi was a research scientist with the Secure Computer Systems group at Stanford University.Dr. Nicolosi holds a Ph.D. (NYU '07) and a M.Sc. (NYU '04) in Computer Science, and is a member of the ACM, the IACR, the Internet Society, and the USENIX association.ExperienceStevens Institute of Technology, Associate Professor, 2014-presentStevens Institute of Technology, Assistant Professor, 2007-2014Stanford University, Research Scientist, 2005-2007Ecole Normale Supérieure (Paris, France), Visiting Researcher, 2005 (part-time) Aarhus Universitet (Århus, Denmark), Visiting Researcher, 2004-2005 (part-time)New York University, Jr. Research Scientist, 2002-2003 (part-time)Institutional ServiceProgram Director of the Masters in CyberSecurity ChairUndergraduate advisor MemberCS faculty hiring MemberAcademic Operations and Affairs MemberUndergraduate advisor MemberCS faculty hiring MemberInstitute Curriculum Committee MemberStevens Institute for Artificial Intelligence MemberDoctoral Written Qualifying Examination Committee ChairHonors and AwardsNSF Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award, 2014EU Marie Curie Fellow, 2004NYU Henry M.
