He was a member of the research advisory board for the Centre for Quantifiable Quality of Service in Communication Systems (Q2S) at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim Norway (from 2006-2010). He was an Adjunct Professor II in the Department of Informatics at Molde University College in Molde, Norway from 1998 - 2007. Prior to joining Pitt in the Fall of 1994, he was a faculty member in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Clemson University (Assistant Professor 1987-1993, tenured Associate Professor 1993 - 1994).    At Clemson, he taught courses on signal processing, control theory, and network performance modeling and received the NCR  Outstanding Undergraduate Teaching Award,  as well as an Outstanding Honors Professor citation. While at Clemson he also served as the  Associate Director of the Center for Computer Communication Systems being responsible for external relations for the research center and organizing an annual conference. During the Summer of 1993, he was a member of technical staff in the Networking Technology Center at The Mitre Corporation in Reston, VA. At  MITRE,  his work focused on protocol evaluation for packet radio networks. Between 1980 and 1982 he  was employed as a   System Engineer on NASA's space shuttle mission simulator by Singer-Link in Houston, TX. Professor Tipper is a graduate of the University of Arizona (Ph.D. Electrical Engineering 1988, M.S. Systems Engineering 1984) and Virginia Tech (B.S. Electrical Engineering 1980). His research interests include network design, virtual network design, methods for improving network survivability, the development of efficient algorithms for nonstationary/transient queueing analysis, and the design and analysis of network controls (e.g. routing, admission control, scheduling, etc.) and� communication networks for smart grid His research has been supported by grants from various government and corporate sources such as the National Science Foundation, ARO, IBM, DARPA and MCI. He is a Senior member of IEEE. Professional activities include serving as the co-guest editor of two special issues of the Journal of Network and Systems Management one on� Fault Management in Communication Networks which appeared in June, 1997 and one on Designing and Managing Optical� Networks and Service Reliability, which appeared March, 2005. Co-guest editor of a special issue of Telecommunication Systems on Reliable Networks Design and Modeling which which appeared in February, 2013.� He has served on the technical program committee for most of the major conferences in the networking field. He was a member of the editorial board of the Journal of Network and Systems Management from 2000 to 2005. He was the technical program chair of the Design of Reliable Communication Networks 2003 Workshop  held in Banff, Canada in October, 2003. Currently he is a member of the steering committee for future DRCNs and was General Chair of DRCN 2009. He is the co-author of the textbook The Physical Layer of Communication Systems, which was published by Artech House in March, 2006. Also, he is the co-editor and a contributor to Information Assurance: Dependability and Security in Networked Systems which was published in 2008. Recent University of Pittsburgh service activities include serving on the University Research Council (1/2000 - 5/2004), Faculty Assembly and Senate Council (97-99), as well as the University Community Relations Committee (96-98).
