I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin, and previously held visiting researcher positions at Arm Research and Harvard University. I do research in visual computing, an exciting area spanning imaging (light transport, optics, and image sensors), human vision (psychophysics and computational modeling), and computer systems (computer architecture and programming systems). My research group page has more to offer. I am always looking for students. If you love nature, are curious about humans, and happen to know how to program, please read this and send me an email. Book Foundations of Visual Computing. It's an open, online textbook on the fundamentals of visual computing, covering human vision, rendering, imaging, and display technologies. A condensed version will be published as a part of the Synthesis Lectures on Computer Architecture series.
