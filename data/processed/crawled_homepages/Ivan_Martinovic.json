Some of my concrete research topics include authentication and intrusion detection using physical-layer information, RF reactive jamming (such as Wireless Firewalls), traffic analysis, and the analysis of trade-offs between system/network security and performance. In this respect, I work with various technologies, such as software-defined radios (SDRs), wireless sensors, and NFC/RFIDs. I'm also intrested in behavioural biometrics and their applications, such as continuous authentication using physiological signals. Previously, I also worked on other non-functional aspects of distributed systems like network performance (network calculus), resource management, and decentralized coordination in wireless networks. As part of our research we are a founding member of OpenSky: OpenSky is a participatory sensor network which collects real-world air transportation communication data, such as ADS-B/Mode-S at large scale (covering over 720,000 km² in Europe). It offers insights into the ADS-B communication channel, characterising typical reception quality and loss patterns in real world. It is intended to serve researchers from different areas as a solid basis for realistic evaluations and simulations. If you are interested in the QPEP project (fast & secure VPN for GEO Satellite Broadband), the paper can be found here, and the implementation is available from github If you are interested in the Brokenwire vulnerability, see: https://brokenwire.fail BiographyIvan is a Professor at the Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford. Before coming to Oxford he was a postdoctoral researcher at the Security Research Lab, UC Berkeley and at the Secure Computing and Networking Centre, UC Irvine. From 2009 until 2011 he enjoyed a Carl-Zeiss Foundation Fellowship and he was an associate lecturer at TU Kaiserslautern, Germany.  He obtained his PhD (2008) from TU Kaiserslautern under supervision of Prof. Jens B. Schmitt and MSc (2004) from TU Darmstadt, Germany.Selected PublicationsView AllManage publications SatIQ: Extensible and Stable Satellite Authentication using Hardware Fingerprinting Joshua Smailes‚ Sebastian Köhler‚ Simon Birnbach‚ Martin Strohmeier and Ivan Martinovic In Preprint.
