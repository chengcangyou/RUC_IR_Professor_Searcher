My primary research interests are in social computing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, and information retrieval, over large-scale systems like the Web and social media. I focus on threats to these systems and design methods to mitigate negative behaviors (e.g., misinformation, hate speech), and look for positive opportunities to mine and analyze these systems for developing next generation algorithms and architectures (e.g., recommender system, natural language understanding). I also focus on AI for social good (e.g., disrupting wildlife trafficking networks).
