  "content": "Javey Research Lab @ Berkeley The core of our research program is materials innovation for enabling new device structures and concepts. We study a wide range of electronic materials in both planar and 3D geometries. In all cases, we explore new schemes of manipulating, processing, and engineering materials - often at the ultimate limits - to enable new functionalities and properties. Our projects represent a balance between short- and long-term applications, some of which have already been successfully transitioned to industry for further R&D. We are highly interdisciplinary, with students and postdoctoral fellows from electrical engineering, chemistry, chemical engineering, materials science, and physics departments. ------------------------------------------ Position openings:  We are always looking for talented Ph.D. students and postdoctoral fellows to join our group. home | publications | research interests | members | sponsors | news | e-mail Copyright ï¿½ University of California at Berkeley",
