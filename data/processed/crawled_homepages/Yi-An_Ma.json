Before that, I was a post-doctoral fellow at EECS, UC Berkeley. I completed my Ph.D. at University of Washington and obtained my bachelor's degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My current research primarily revolves around scalable inference methods for credible machine learning. This involves designing Bayesian inference methods to quantify uncertainty in the predictions of complex models; understanding computational and statistical guarantees of inference algorithms; and leveraging these scalable algorithms to learn from time series data and perform sequential decision making tasks. AnnouncementsThe 35th International Conference on Algorithmic Learning Theory (ALT 2024) will take place in San Diego, co-located with ITA 2024.Grateful for the Facebook Research AwardThe Institute for Learning-enabled Optimization at Scale: An NSF Artificial Intelligence InstituteNews article: Applied Mathematics in the Era of Data Science: An Algorithmic PerspectiveContactE-mail:                                                   yianma@ucsd.eduGoogle Scholar Page:                   Yi-An MaGoogle SitesReport abuseGoogle SitesReport abuse",
