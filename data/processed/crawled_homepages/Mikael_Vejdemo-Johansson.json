As of the Fall semester, 2016, I am Assistant Professor of Data Science at the mathematics department of CUNY College of Staten Island. As of the Spring semester, 2017, I am Doctoral Faculty in the PhD program in Computer Science at the CUNY Graduate Center. Since 2019 I have been Deputy Executive Officer for the joint PhD in Computer Science and MSc in Data Science programs. Contact If you are a student, please use Mikael.VejdemoJohansson@csi.cuny.edu. All other inquiries, please use mvj@math.csi.cuny.edu. My office on CUNY College of Staten Island, Willowbrook campus, is 1S-208. At the Graduate Center, my office is 4319.02. I prefer contact by email over contact by telephone. Research My main area of interest is in applied algebraic topology and topological data analysis: how to compute the shape of a data set, and how to use that shape to understand the underlying data. A large collection of lecture slides, written papers and other information can be found on my CV website. I have helped create several software packages for persistent homology, most recently JavaPlex. I am chair of the coordinating committee of the ATMCS conference series. Among my many side projects is an enumeration of possible tieknots. To go with this paper, I wrote a webpage with a random tieknot generator. Teaching Students Here are incomplete lists of students I have worked with either to advise thesis projects or to supervise independent studies.

I exhibited at the Joint Mathematics Meetings 2020. I exhibited in the group show Mathematical Beauty at the AAAS Gallery. I exhibited at the Joint Mathematics Meetings 2019. I exhibited and gave an invited lecture at the Bridges Mathematical Art Conference 2018. I exhibited at the Joint Mathematics Meetings 2012. I am helping to launch the Illustrating Mathematics community. Currently the best place to get to know us is at our wiki.",
