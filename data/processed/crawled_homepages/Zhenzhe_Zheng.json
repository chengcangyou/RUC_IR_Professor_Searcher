China E-mail: zhengzhenzhe [@] sjtu [DOT] edu [DOT] cn About me Welcome to my homepage! I am currently a professor in the School of Computer Science @ Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I received my Ph.D. from the CS department @ Shanghai Jiao Tong University in March 2018. My advisors were Prof. Prof. Fan Wu and Prof. Guihai Chen. I was a visiting research scholar and then a postdoctoral researcher in the Coordinated Science Laboratory (CSL) @ UIUC from September 2016 to October 2019, advised by Prof. R. Srikant. I am the recipient of the China Computer Federation (CCF) Excellent Doctoral Dissertation Award in 2018. During my Ph.D. program, I was supported by Google Ph.D. Fellowship and Microsoft Research Asia Ph.D. Fellowship. My research interests are in the intersection of economics, learning and system. In particular, I have focused on game theory, machine learning, mobile computing and their applications for Agentic AI system, such as On-device AI Agent and Multi-agents online platform markets. Students: I am constantly looking for well motivated students (both undergrad and graduate) who are interested in game theory, machine learning and reinforcement learning, mobile computing, performance analysis and algorithm design, and system implementations. Please email me if you are interested. Recent News [2025.09] Our Paper ’’Optimizing Storage Overhead of User Behavior Log for ML-embedded Mobile Apps’’ has been accepted to ACM SIGMETRICS 2026.
