Smead Aerospace Engineering Sciences Professor Nisar Ahmed’s research explores new algorithms and models for probabilistic reasoning that promote cooperative intelligence in mixed teams of humans and autonomous robotic vehicles. The COHRINT Lab blends this cutting-edge theory with real-world robotic software and hardware. Key problem areas for aerospace applications include: integrated sensing, perception, planning and control in human-robot teams learning and prediction of human/autonomy decision making and task performance fusion of complex information in dynamic sensor networks Fall 2022 – COHRINT Lab (and our precious robots) at the Smead Aerospace Building Oct 2022 – CU robotics researchers group photo from IROS 2022 in Kyoto, Japan Affiliations The COHRINT Lab is part of the Research and Engineering Center for Unmanned Systems (RECUV) and the Ann and H.J.
