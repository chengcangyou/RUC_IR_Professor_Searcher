Prior to that, I received my B.Sc in Computer Science from Nanjing University in 2017. I was also a recipient of the 2020-2022 IBM Ph.D. Fellowship. I currently lead the Abstract Team, where our research focuses on Exploit Analysis and Synthesis, Quantum Control System, and Machine Learning for Systems. I am also the faculty advisor of CU Cyber Club.
