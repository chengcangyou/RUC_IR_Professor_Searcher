I have been working on quality-quaranteed meshing, in particular quad-meshing; various issues related to hierarchical simplicial meshes, including pointerless representations, efficient neighbor-finding; different subdivision techniques and quality guarantees associated with them and level-of-detail modeling. I have also worked on design and implementation of geometric data structures and algorithms with applications to computer graphics, in particular, efficient realistic rendering. F.
