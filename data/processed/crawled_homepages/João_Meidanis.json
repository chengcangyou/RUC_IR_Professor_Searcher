I am part of the Computational Biology Group in my department. Since mid-1997, J. C. Setubal and myself have been involved in setting up and coordinating the LBI - Bioinformatics Laboratory, which serves several genome projects in Brazil. In 1999, João Paulo Kitajima has also joined us as coordinator of the lab. In 2002, I started Scylla, a bioiformatics company, with a group of colleagues from LBI. Press vehicles Pesquisa FAPESP and Folha de Sao Paulo noted the event. Scylla received an initial investment from Votorantim Ventures (later Votorantim New Business) and was located at the Softex business incubator. In 2004, Scylla completed its incubation process. In 2005, the company became profitable. Along our main bioinformatics product line, we now develop software for other scientific applications as well.
