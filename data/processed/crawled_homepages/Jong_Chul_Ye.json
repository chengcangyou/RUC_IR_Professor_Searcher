Such problems pose interesting challenges that often lead to investigations of fundamental problems in various branches of physics, mathematics, signal processing, biology, and medicine. While most of the biomedical imaging researchers are interested in addressing this problem using off-the-self tools from signal processing, machine learning, statistics, and optimization and combining their domain-specific knowledge, our approaches are unique in the sense that I believe that actual  imaging applications are a source of endless inspiration for new mathematical theories and we are eager to solve both specific applications and application-inspired fundamental theoretical problems.
