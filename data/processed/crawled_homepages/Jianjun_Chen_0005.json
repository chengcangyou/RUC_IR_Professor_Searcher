Postdoc positions are also avaliable. Please feel free to email me. Me and My Research I am an associate professor at the Institute for Network Sciences and Cyberspace at Tsinghua University. Before joining Tsinghua, I was a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley (worked with Prof. Vern Paxson) and the University of Chicago (worked with Prof. Nick Feamster). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Tsinghua University in 2018. My research interest focus on network security, protocol security, and system security. I'm particularly interested in discovering and mitigating new security vulnerabilities in widely-used Internet protocols and systems, such as HTTP protocol, CDN system, email system, and web browsers. My research has won multiple Distinguished Paper Awards on the top-tier security conferences (e.g., NDSS 2016, USENIX security 2020, USENIX security 2025), and led to many real-world security improvements, such as patches in popular HTTP implementations (e.g., Squid, Chrome, Firefox), security advisories by industrial companies (e.g., Akamai, Cloudflare, Apple), web standard change, and a new IETF RFC (RFC 8586).
