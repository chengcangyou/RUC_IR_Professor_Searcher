I received a PhD in Statistics from Stanford in 2017, where I was advised by Susan Holmes. Following that, I spent a year as a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Computational Biology at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Erick Matsen’s group. My undergraduate degree was from Yale, where I received a B.S. in Biology. I develop statistical and computational methods that help us understand complex, structured data. I have worked with David Relman’s group on the human microbiome, with Catherine Blish’s group on natural killer cell repertoires, and I currently work with Erick Matsen on B cell repertoires. My husband, Jason Wu, studies Chinese public opinion.",
