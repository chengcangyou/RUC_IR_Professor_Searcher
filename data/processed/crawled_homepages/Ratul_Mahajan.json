Allen School of Computer Science). He is also the co-director of UW FOCI (Future of Cloud Infrastructure) and an Amazon Scholar. Prior to that, he was a Co-founder and CEO of Intentionet, a company that pioneered intent-based networking and network verification, and a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research. He got his PhD at the University of Washington and B.Tech at Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, both in Computer Science and Engineering. Ratul is a computer systems researcher with a networking focus and has worked on a broad set of topics, including network verification, connected homes, network programming, optical networks, Internet routing and measurements, and mobile systems. He has published over fifty papers in top venues such as SIGCOMM, SOSP, MobiCom, CHI, and PLDI, and many of the technologies that he has helped develop are part of real-world systems at Microsoft and other companies. Ratul has been recognized as an ACM Distinguished Scientist, an ACM SIGCOMM Rising Star, and a Microsoft Research Graduate Fellow. His papers have won the ACM SIGCOMM Test-of-Time Award, the IEEE William R. Bennett Prize, the ACM SIGCOMM Best Paper Awards (twice), and the HVC Best Paper Award.",
