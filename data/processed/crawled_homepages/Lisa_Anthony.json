From journal articles and theses to high-stakes fellowships and grant proposals, I help scholars shape their research ideas into compelling narratives. ➺ Enrollment is open! “Write Your (NSF) CAREER” proposal coaching program — scroll down or ⤷ jump to the details. WHATEVER YOUR STAGE, I CAN HELP! Get My Help As an associate professor of computer science, I know how overwhelming it can be to take an idea from draft to polished submission.
