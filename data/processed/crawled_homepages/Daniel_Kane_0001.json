Kane Department Address: 9500 Gilman Drive #0404 La Jolla, CA  92093-0404 Office Locations: CSE 4212 Phone: (858) 246-0102 AP&M 7131   Phone: (858) 534-2125 I am a professor at UCSD with a joint appointment between CSE and Mathematics. My username is dakane and you can reach me at this username at @ucsd.edu, or @math.ucsd.edu. I also have a gmail account with username ALadKeenIn. Teaching This academic year I am teaching: Fall 2025: Math 96 (Putnam Seminar) Fall 2025: Math 154 (Graph Theory) Winter 2026: CSE 101 (Introduction to Algorithms) Spring 2026: CSE 203A (Randomized Algorithms) Research I have broad research interests within mathematics and theoretical computer science. While my research covers a wide range of topics my mathematics work tends to be within the broad areas of number theory and combinatorics, while my computer science research tends to be about derandomization, Boolean functions (with particular emphasis on polynomial threshold functions), or machine learning. For the past few years, the bulk of my research has been in computational statistics. In particular, I have a recent book on robust statistics with Ilias Diakonikolas to be published by Cambridge University Press. Papers Talks CV",
