If you have a potential project in mind, feel free to drop me an email to discuss further. 20182025 Research activity per year Personal profile BiographyI'm an Assistant Professor (or Lecturer in the traditional UK system) in the School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. Additionally, I am an Associate Member of the Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford. Prior to joining Heriot-Watt, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher with Anthony Lin at TU Kaiserslautern in Germany. I hold a DPhil/PhD from the University of Oxford (supervised by Julian Gutierrez and Mike Wooldridge), an MSc from the University of Liverpool, and a BSc from Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology. I also have industry experience as a R&D software engineer at Samsung Electronics. Fully-funded PhD opportunities at Heriot-Watt:I am currently accepting applications from PhD students who are interested in working with me in my main research areas. Funding is available to cover both international tuition fees and living expenses. For more information, please visit the PhD opportunities in Computer Science page. If you have a potential project in mind, feel free to drop me an email to discuss further. I look forward to hearing from you! The Edinburgh Centre for Robotics, where I am a member of the supervisory team, may currently have openings for the UKRI AI Centre for Doctoral Training in Dependable and Deployable AI for Robotics (CDT-D2AIR). This is a 4-year PhD programme jointly offered by Heriot-Watt University and the University of Edinburgh. You can find application information here.

My research focuses on applying formal and mathematical methods to analyse and verify the behaviour of AI systems, particularly those involving multiple autonomous agents (see multi-agent systems). I draw on techniques from formal verification, logic, and game theory to develop rigorous approaches that guarantee correctness and robustness. My main research areas include: Logic and game theory in theoretical computer science and foundations of AI.Verification, design, and synthesis of equilibria in concurrent multi-agent systems.Mathematical/computational logic (e.g., modal and temporal logics).Model checking, automated synthesis, and formal verification.Computational complexity of problems related to topics above. I am the main developer of EVE (Equilibrium Verification Environment), a tool for rational verification. The tool can be used online from http://eve.cs.ox.ac.uk. I am always interested in improving EVE (e.g., faster techniques, new use cases, etc.) and welcome potential collaborations. I am interested in supervising PhD/MSc/BSc students who want to work on (or related to) the topics above. If you have a potential project in mind, feel free to drop me an email to discuss further.
