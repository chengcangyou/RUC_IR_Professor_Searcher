From 2016-2021, I was the PI of a five-year project \"Dynamics of Multiple, Interacting and Concurrent Markov Chains\" (DYNAMIC MARCH) as part of an ERC Starting Grant funded by the European Research Council. From 2015-2019, I was a co-PI of the grant \"Analysis of Discrete Load Balancing on Heterogeneous Networks\" (ADLON) funded by the German Research Council (DFG). From 2014-2015, I was the PI of the project \"Random Walks on Massive Graphs\" supported by the Isaac Newton Trust / University of Cambridge Early Career Support Scheme.
