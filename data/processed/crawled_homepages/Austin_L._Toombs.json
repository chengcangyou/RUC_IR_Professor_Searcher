I am also a Visiting Researcher at Northumbria University and a Visiting Professor at Beijing Normal University. I have previously been: an Assistant Professor at Purdue University. an external research collaborator with Facebook. a postdoc (Research Associate) at Open Lab within Newcastle University (and later a Visiting Researcher there). a PhD student studying Informatics in the School of Informatics and Computing at Indiana University, with a minor in Inquiry Methodology. a Master’s student studying Human Computer Interaction Design at Indiana University. a Bachelor of Science student studying Computer Science at Ball State University, with a minor in Mathematics. My research interests center on the impact that digital technologies have on how communities are formed and maintained. This includes: Community platforms for sports gambling. Studying how drones connect people in a neighborhood. Developing computational neural networks that predict behavioral patterns. How community dynamics are shaped by technologies that encourage some types of relationships (e.g., acquaintanceships) while leaving some unsupported (e.g., deep and meaningful friendships). How such technologically influenced relationship dynamics affect the the formation and maintenance of community norms, as well as the inclusivity, welcomeness, and diversity of a community. How people creatively adopt and adapt digital platforms and tools, such as Discord, Slack, and file-sharing systems, to meet their interpersonal and community communication needs in an increasingly technologically-mediated world. In prior work I have studied maker, hacker, and DIY communities through both physical and digital ethnographies, the participatory design of hackathon-like events, and large-scale listserv communication analyses. In that work, I focused on explicating the ways in which individuals develop identities as makers/hackers/expert-amateurs, as well as how they participate in their community. In my post-doctoral work on digital civics, I extended the methodological lenses I have developed to threads related to social care, civic engagement, and health informatics, specifically focusing on how individuals transition to their lives as new parents. As a professor, I have applied these insights to communities of video game players, a wide variety of Communities of Practice (including mental health professionals and industrial manufacturing companies), and co-living, co-housing, and co-working communities. My research has been supported by the National Science Foundation, the Department of Defense, and the Wabash Heartland Innovation Network.
