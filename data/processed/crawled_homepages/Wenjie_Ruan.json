Short Bio Currently, I am a Senior Lecturer in Data Science (~Associate Professor in US system) in the College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences at University of Exeter, UK. I am also the Co-Lead of Trustworthy AI Theme, at IDSAI. Before my current position, I was a Lecturer in the School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University. Before that, funded by the EPSRC Project - Mobile Robotics: Enabling a Pervasive Technology of the Future, I had worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher with Prof. Marta Kwiatkowska in the Department of Computer Science at University of Oxford for two years. I received my Ph.D. degree from the School of Computer Science at University of Adelaide, Australia. During my PhD, I did a six-month research intern in IoT Tech Center (GreenOrbs), Tsinghua University. Before my PhD, I was a Control System Engineer in Institutes of Optics and Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. My current research interests lie in: (1) Robustness, Safety and Interpretability of Deep Learning Models; (2) Interpretable Machine Learning and Its Applications in Health Data Analytics and Human-Centred Computing.
