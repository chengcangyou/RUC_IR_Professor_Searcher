I am an assistant professor with the Theory of Computer Science Group from the Informatics Institute of the University of Amsterdam (UvA). While I have broad interests in much of theoretical computer science, most of my work focuses on coding theory, cryptography, and their intersection.Prior to joining the UvA, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Cryptology Group at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI), hosted by Ronald Cramer. I obtained my PhD from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), where I was fortunate to be advised by Venkatesan Guruswami and Bernhard Haeupler.CVCVGoogle ScholarGoogle ScholarFolder (Alt)DBLPResearchRefereed PublicationsTitleAuthorsVenue(s)LinksLinear time encodable binary code achieving GV bound with linear time encodable dual achieving GV boundMartijn Brehm, and Nicolas ReschITCS 2026full versionList-Recovery of Random Linear Codes over Small FieldsDean Doron, Jonathan Mosheiff, Nicolas Resch, and JoÃ£o RibeiroRANDOM 2025full versionOn the Independence Assumption in Quasi-Cyclic Code-Based CryptographyMaxime Bombar, Nicolas Resch, and Emiel WiedijkISIT 2025full versionRandomness-Efficient Constructions of Capacity-Achieving List-Decodable CodesJonathan Mosheiff, Nicolas Resch, Kuo Shang, and Chen YuanISIT 2025full versionWorst and Average Case Hardness of Decoding via Smoothing BoundsThomas Debris-Alazard and Nicolas ReschPKC 2025full versionBlaze: Fast SNARKs from Interleaved RAA CodesMartijn Brehm, Binyi Chen, Ben Fisch, Nicolas Resch, Ron D.
