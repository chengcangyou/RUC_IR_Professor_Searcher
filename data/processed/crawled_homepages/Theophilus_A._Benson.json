Benson Home Publications Software And Datasets Grants Outreach Projects CV CONTACT Email: theophilus [at] cmu [dot] edu Google Scholar About Me I am a professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Carnegie Mellon University and at Carnegie Mellon University-Africa. My group focuses on developing models and designing algorithms and frameworks to improve the performance and availability of computer networks. In particular, my group explores the critical role that network state plays in determining network performance and availability with the stateâs inherent semantics and emergent state management techniques by investigating designs and algorithms to more holistically understand and manage this state. More recently, we have applied this approach to addressing the digital divide, improving microservices/clouds, managing software defined networks, and rethinking CDN designs. Our designs and systems have been deployed at web scale companies, adopted by opensource systems, and acquired by a large hardware manufacturer. Hiring: I am actively recruiting MS, PhD, and Post-Docs. Post-Docs: I am looking to hire a post-doc researcher on network measurements PhD: We are actively seeking highly motivated PhD students interested. Send me an email. For CMU-MS students, you can find project descriptions here and on ECE's SPT portal. News Paper Oct 2025 Our work on using eBPF for diagnosizing RDMA NIC issues accepted at LPC'25.
