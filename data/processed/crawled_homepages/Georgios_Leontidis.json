I am also a Turing Academic Liaison and the Centre Deputy Director (co-director) of the £10.9M UKRI AI CDT \"SUSTAIN\". I have a strong interest in both theoretical aspects of Machine/Deep Learning, e.g. capsule networks, domain adaptation, self-supervised learning etc., as well as applications, e.g. data imputation in environmental data of COSMOS-UK network (PI in NERC/EPSRC project ENTRAIN - NE/S016236/1, NE/S016244/1), homomorphic encryption with deep learning for enabling data sharing and analytics in food industry (PI - IoFT network plus EPSRC project), anomaly detection in nuclear reactors (Co-PI in H2020 project Cortex - 20 EU partners), Optimising retail refrigeration systems with machine learning (Co-PI-IUK project with Tesco), forecasting yield in strawberries and tomatoes (Co-PI-EU Interreg project SmartGreen and PhD studentship), Gas Turbine availability and fault prediction with Siemens Lincoln, etc. I am currently leading/co-leading several funded projects, including Enhancing Agri-Food Transparent Sustainability (PI), Predictive Emissions Monitoring System for Gas Turbines with Siemens Energy and Machine Learning and Expert-based System for Soft Fruit Yield Forecasting (Data Lab and Angus Soft Fruits). Previously I was a Senior Lecturer at the University of Lincoln, a Senior Data Scientist at IBA Dosimetry in Germany and a Marie Curie ITN Fellow. I serve as reviewer/AC in various top venues, such as NeurIPS/ICML/AAAI/ICLR, and participated in the UK AI Council’s Data Working Group ecosystem. I am also a member of the Full College of EPSRC and a panel college member of the UKRI FLF. I am also an External Examiner at Cranfield University (MSc applied AI). I am currently supervising 14 PhD students and managing 4 fellows.

I am also working on novel neural network architectures, such as Capsule Networks. In terms of application areas, I have a strong interest in problems that ML can provide solutions primarily in environmental, industrial, food and healthcare settings. My past and current activity involves working with national and international collaborators on nuclear reactor perturbation analysis, optimising retail refrigeration systems, gap filling in environmental time-series, domain adaptation for food retail packaging image quality detection, disease detection, and yield forecasting for strawberries and tomatoes Research Areas Accepting PhDs I am currently accepting PhDs in Computing Science.

Current Research I am currently working on the following problems across several funded projects: a) Agrifood sustainability with AI across several funded projects, such as the UKRI AI CDT SUSTAIN (https://www.sustain-cdt.ai/) and the EPSRC EATS project (https://eats.org.uk/) b) New routing algorithms for Capsule Networks in order to improve their run time and performance, whilst reducing the number of parameters c) Yield forecasting for strawberries - we use mobile robots to collect data in a setting that our collaborators at the Univeristy of Lincoln have in the Riseholme campus. We collect time-series, image, depth and video data, so that we can develop new machine learning techniques that can accurately and robustly forecast yield in 1-, 2- and 3- weeks ahead d) Predicting availability of gas turbines, a collaboration with Siemens Energy Industrial Turbomachinery Ltd. Past Research --Gap filling in environmental time-series, specifically for the Cosmos-UK network. We developed new data imputation techniques in order to fill the gaps in the time series using historical data from most of the Cosmos-UK sites across the UK (https://www.ceh.ac.uk/our-science/projects/entrain) - project funded by NERC, EPSRC and Defra (NERC-led) --Optimising demand side response of retail refrigeration systems with Machine Learning, a collaboration with Tesco and funded by Innovate UK Collaborations UK: a) Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Wallingford, with Matt Fry, Jon Evans, Steve Cole, Mike Bowes and John Wallbank b) British Geological Survey, Keyworth, with Andy Kingdon and john Bloomfield c) Sheffield University, Mike Mangan d) University of Lincoln, MLearn group, LIAT and LCAS groups e) Siemens Energy Industrial Turbomachinery Ltd.
