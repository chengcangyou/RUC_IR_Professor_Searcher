She is currently the David Reese Professor in the College of Information Sciences and Technology, and an affiliate member of the Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences and the Institute for Computational and Data Sciences at the Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA. Her research interests are in the areas of artificial intelligence, computer vision, biomedical image computing, and machine learning, focusing on methods for image and video segmentation, image and video synthesis, 3D computer vision, object recognition, computer-assisted diagnosis and intervention, registration/matching, and motion tracking. Her broader interests include AI and data science for healthcare and biomedicine, biomedical informatics, computer graphics, visualization, and human-computer interaction. She regularly serves as an area chair and on the program committees of major conferences in medical image computing and computer vision and is an associate editor for several journals including Medical Image Analysis, and Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics. Her research has been funded by the NIH, NSF, DOE, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and the Pennsylvania state. Courses: Fall 2025: Algorithmic Methods and Tools (DS 305) Fall 2024: Data Integration (DS 320) Fall 2022: Introduction to Data Sciences (DS 200) Fall 2021: Visual Analytics for Data Sciences (DS 330) Spring 2021: Machine Learning in Healthcare (IST 597) Fall 2020: Data Management for Data Sciences (DS 220) Spring 2019: Machine Learning Methods in Biomedical Image Informatics (IST 597) Fall 2018: Organization of Data (IST 210) Research: I am a computer scientist who is curious about how human brain, eye, body, and cell, function. Hence I am always excited about developing robust image analysis methods and building autonomous and intelligent systems that integrate algorithms with efficient, application-specific designs to solve computational problems in biomedicine, perception, and cognition. In particular, I work toward robust medical imaging software based on computer vision and machine learning algorithms that aid medical doctors in accurate and reproducible diagnosis, and help them better understand the anatomical and physiological relationships in normal and diseased states. I develop image processing and analysis software for analyzing biological images to help biologists and biophysicists in understanding and modeling complex biological pathways and systems. I also create intelligent vision systems that are capable of learning effectively and reasoning about multiple sources of information in order to achieve functions typical of human vision.
