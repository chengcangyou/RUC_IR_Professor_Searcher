I was previously a Senior Quantum Systems Architect as part of Microsoft's quantum computing program where I designed the Azure Quantum Resource Estimator to understand the resource needs of practical-scale quantum applications. I graduated with a Computer Science Ph.D. from Princeton University. My PhD research aimed at developing an efficient quantum computing stack to bridge the resources gap between quantum algorithms and hardware that is buildable in the near future. My work has been adopted by several industry compilers, influenced architecture and industry benchmarking practices. My work has been recognized by the ACM SIGARCH/IEEE CS TCCA Outstanding Dissertation Award (2022), Communications of ACM Research Highlights (2022), an IBM PhD fellowship (2021) and an IEEE Micro Top Picks award (2019).
