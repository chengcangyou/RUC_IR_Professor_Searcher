I did my graduate work in mathematics at the University of Chicago, where I received my SM in 1976 and my PhD, directed by Professor Robert I. Soare, in 1980. From 1980 to 1984, I was an HC Wang Assistant Professor in the Mathematics Department of Cornell University. From 1980 to 1981, I also had a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellowship. I was at the University of Massachusetts at Boston starting in 1984, first in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, then in the Department of Computer Science, except for one sabbatical year and two half sabbatical years spent at Heidelberg University. I became a full professor in 1995 and was Department Chair from 2001 to 2019. I retired in May 2019. Research My research interests are Computability Theory (also known as Recursion Theory) and Theoretical Computer Science. (See the Computability Theory Wiki Page for more information on Computability Theory.) I have co-authored a book, Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science, Volume 1: Sets, Relations and Induction, published by Springer-Verlag in their Texts and Monographs in Computer Science series. Volume 2, Logical Foundations of Computer Science, is in preparation. My articles (see publications list for the exact references) have mostly dealt with the study of the computably enumerable (also known as recursively enumerable) sets and their degrees under various reducibilities. Teaching I mainly taught courses in Theoretical Computer Science.
