She received a MSc. in Electronics from Polytechnic University of Bucharest, Romania, in 1993, and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Åbo Akademi and Turku Centre for Computer Science, Åbo/Turku, Finland, in Dec. 2005. Her research focuses on developing formal models and verification techniques for designing predictable real-time, adaptive and autonomous systems.Teaching:DVA 468 - Catching Bugs by Formal Verification (PROMPT course): 2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017DVA 241 - Distributed Systems (undergraduate course): 2019, 2018, 2017CDT 316 - Distributed Systems (undergraduate course): 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013DVA 442 - Advanced Validation and Verification (graduate, distance course) : 2017, 2016, 2015DVA 402 - Advanced Validation and Verification (graduate course): 2012, 2011, 2010CDT 505 - Real-Time Systems II (graduate course): 2012, 2011, 2009, 2008The Science of Programming (Ph.D. course): 2009  Cristina Seceleanu's research focuses on developing and applying formal methods (especially model checking and variants) for designing and reasoning about component-based, resource-constrained real-time systems, service-oriented systems, adaptive embedded systems, and autonomous systems. The goal is to provide mathematical means of verifying system behaviors at early stages of development.Cristina is leading the Formal Modeling and Analysis of Embedded Systems research group, at MDU, and is also the research leader of the Computer and Data Science (CDS) research direction. She has also been teacher representative for Embedded Systems, IDT, in the committee for research of the faculty board (Utskottet för forskning), 2015-2016. Cristina is co-author of the following integrated development environments (IDE) / toolchains that implement the research results obtained together with wonderful collaborators:REMES IDE : developed as a cooperation between projects DICES and PROGRESS. It supports the construction and analysis of embedded system behavioral models described in the REMES language. REMES is a hierarchical, dense-time language for modeling function, time and resource usage of embedded components. The REMES IDE consists of a set of tools, as follows: (i) REMES editor, (ii) automated transformations of REMES models into priced timed automata for formal analysis and verification, and (iii) REMES simulator of the timing behavior and resource consumption of embedded components, at design time. Together with Aneta Vulgarakis Feljan, Ericsson Research, Stockholm, and Marin Orliς, at that time at Ericsson Nikola Tesla, Zagreb, currently at Ericsson Research, Stockholm. ViTAL toolchain :  a verification tool tailored for the architectural language EAST-ADL, in which functional and timing behaviors of function prototypes are expressed as timed automata models that have precise semantics and can be formally verified. The ViTAL tool enables the automatic transformation of EAST-ADL functional models into UPPAAL PORT or UPPAAL, for model checking. Together with Raluca Marinescu, Eduard Paul Enoiu, and Paul Pettersson.  ReSA: a requirements specification language based on constrained natural language, which uses domain knowledge to limit the syntax as well as the semantics, thus reducing ambiguity and improving consistency of specifications. Its tool support consists of an editor and a consistency checker via SMT solving in Z3. The method and tool have been developed by Cristina's ex-Ph.D. student Nesredin Mahmud, currently at Volvo Cars, Sweden.   Editorial Boards:Frontiers in  Computer Science: Theoretical Computer ScienceInternational Journal for Software Tools for Technology Transfer (STTT), Springer International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering Systems (IJECES) , University of Osijek, Croatia. PC Chair and Organizer of:Computer Architecture and Platforms Symposium (CAP 2025)@COMPSAC 2025, Toronto, Canada, July 8 - 11, 2025: Symposium chair.Workshop on Advances in Model-Based Testing (A-MOST 2025), co-located with ICST 2025,March 31 - April 4, 2025, Naples, Italy: PC chairSymposium on Leveraging Applications of Formal Methods, Verification and Validation: Scalable Verification and Validation of Concurrent and Distributed Systems (ScaVeri), Crete, Greece, Oct. 27-31, 2024: Track chairComputer Architecture and Platforms Symposium (CAP 2024)@COMPSAC 2024, Osaka, Japan, July 2-4, 2024: Symposium chair.Workshop on Advances in Model-Based Testing (A-MOST 2024), co-located with ICST 2024,May 27 - 31, 2024, Toronto, Canada: PC chairNordic Workshop on Programming Theory (NWPT 2023), Nov. 22-23, 2023, MDU, Västerås, Sweden: PC chair.International Conference on Engineering of Computer-Based Systems (ECBS 2023), Oct. 16 - 18, 2023, MDU, Västerås, Sweden: General chairTests and Proofs International Conference (TAP 2023), Leicester, United Kingdom, July 17-21, 2023, co-located with STAF 2023: PC chair.Computer Architecture and Platforms Symposium (CAP 2023)@COMPSAC 2023, Turin, Italy, June 26-30, 2023: Symposium chair.Workshop on Advances in Model-Based Testing (A-MOST 2023), co-located with ICST 2023, April 16 - 20, 2023, Dublin, Ireland: PC chairSymposium on Leveraging Applications of Formal Methods, Verification and Validation: Verification and Validation of Concurrent and Distributed Heterogeneous Systems, Rhodes, Greece, Oct. 22-30, 2022: Track chairUCAmI 2019: 13th International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing and Ambient ‪Intelligence, Toledo, Spain, Dec 2 - 5, 2019: IoT and Sensors Track chair.   Computer Architecture and Platforms Symposium (CAP 2019)@COMPSAC 2019, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA, July 15 - 19, 2019: Symposium chair. Computer Architecture and Platforms Symposium (CAP 2018)@COMPSAC2018, Tokyo, Japan, July 23-27, 2018: Symposium chairComputer Architecture and Platforms Symposium (CAP2017)@COMPSAC 2017, Turin, Italy, 4th-8th July 2017: Symposium chair.FMICS-AVoCS 2017: International Workshop on Formal Methods for Industrial Critical Systems and Automated Verification of Critical Systems, Turin, Italy, 18-20 September 2017: PC chair.
