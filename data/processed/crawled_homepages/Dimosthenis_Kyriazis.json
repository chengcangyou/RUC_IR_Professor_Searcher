Since 2007, he holds a PhD in the area of Service Oriented Architectures with a focus on quality aspects and workflow management from the school of Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of NTUA. His expertise lies with service-based, distributed and heterogeneous systems, software engineering and data management. He has participated in several EU and National funded projects (e.g. BigDataStack, CrowdHEALTH, MATILDA, 5GTANGO, CYBELE, ORBIT, VISION Cloud, IRMOS, 4CaaSt) leading research for addressing issues related to quality of service provisioning, fault tolerance, workflow management, performance modeling in service oriented environments and application domains such as multimedia, post-production, virtual reality, finance, e-health and others. He is currently focusing on data management, virtualization technologies for high-availability in cloud and edge environments, as well as socially-enhanced techniques for IoT management – coordinating EU funded projects that target these areas, while also analyzing topics related to big data management and content syndication. He has also participated is several EU working groups (such as Future Internet Architecture, and Cloud QoS&SLAs).
