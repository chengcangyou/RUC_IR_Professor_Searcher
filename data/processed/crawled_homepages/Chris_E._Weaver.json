On vacation in Michigan with my niece Chris Weaver Associate Professor, School of Computer Science University of Oklahoma If you're here, there's a good chance you're looking for Improvise. Teaching I teach a variety of courses in Computer Science and the Data Science and Analytics programs, mostly in the areas of human-computer interaction, computer graphics, and visualization. This semester (Fall 2019) I am teaching Visual Analytics (CS 5093). Next semester (Spring 2020) I am teaching Computer Graphics (CS 4053/5053) and Human Computer Interaction (CS 4063/5063). Research My core research interests are in information visualization and visual analytics. My work focuses on user interface architectures, data query languages, and multidimensional visual query patterns in interactive visualization environments. I'm particularly interested in application of interactive visualization techniques for scholarship throughout the humanities. I am the principal developer of Improvise, a desktop application for building and browsing highly interactive visualizations of multidimensional data. Over the years, Improvise has become a virtual laboratory for a wide variety of research projects that involve interaction in one way or another. The diverse and excellent people in my research group help me with all of this. Many of them move to the Pacific Northwest after they graduate. I'm jealous! Service In 2013 I completed a seven year tour of duty on the organizing committee of the IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. I continue to serve the visualization community as a peer reviewer for a wide variety of conferences and journals related to visualization and human-computer interaction. This year I am serving as a papers co-chair for the 4th Workshop on Visualization for the Digital Humanities (Vis4DH). At OU, I am currently serving a second term as a member of the Faculty Senate (2014–2017, 2018–present). I was also the faculty advisor (and chief haiku poet) of our Student Chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (SACM) from 2008–2016. Current Project and Opportunities My research falls primary in the areas of information visualization, visual analytics, databases, human-computer interaction, and applications in the digital humanities. This often involves research assistanceships and/or thesis/dissertation advising with graduate students. I also advise students looking to work on research projects for independent study credit, including undergraduate honors research. Inquiries from current and potential OU students are welcome. Note that CS graduate students wanting to do an independent study on visualization with me must first complete my course on Visual Analytics (CS 5093). My research group and I are currently focusing on the following funded projects: CAREER: Interactive Gesture-Based Data Manipulation and Visualization for Exploratory Learning and Research (project details here and at ampliation.org). Funded by National Science Foundation Award #1351055 from 2014–2020. Our ongoing work involves collaboration with digital humanities scholars and educators from OU and beyond. Key efforts include data collection, software implementation, visualization development, technical support for project-related research activities of our collaborators, as well as to provide assistance in visualization design, usability evaluation, educational outreach, and technical support for project-related education activities of our collaborators. Although no new GRA positions are available at present, you are welcome to contact me if you are interested in pursuing graduate work in topics like this. Inquiries from graduate students with relevant experience outside of CS are also welcome. PhD students: Even without GRA support, I am willing to advise PhD dissertation work within the scope of my (fairly broad) research interests. Master's students: I almost always require Master's students in my research group to pursue and sincerely intend to complete a Master's thesis. Please take that into account before approaching me about possible GRA positions. (Information on the CS thesis option is available here.) Undergraduate students: If you are interested in participating in research, you are welcome to contact me. Funding may be available in some circumstances. Students at all levels are welcome to approach me with ideas for independent studies within my areas of expertise. Last modified: Wed Oct 28 16:12:40 2020 by Chris Weaver",
