I am interested in images and videos that have location associated with them. Overhead imagers from satellite or aerial platforms are a traditional example. However, the advent of low-cost, small GPS recievers has broadened this. Unmaned aerial vehicles (more commonly known as drones) now represent another source of overhead images and videos. And, there are millions of photographs and movies taken from smart phones, etc. that have location information. Knowing the location of these images and videos allows us to infer things about our Earth through image understanding. I develop computer vision and machine learning techniques to extract geospatial information from these images and videos.
