Minku is a Senior Lecturer in Intelligent Systems. He has over 70 publications in scientific venues, book chapters, columns for practitioners and articles to the general public. His research has been funded by EPSRC. Leandro is enthusiastic about discussing and teaching artificial intelligence, and has strong research interests in the field of machine learning, including its intersections with other fields such as software engineering. Leandro is a co-supervisor of ECOLE, an Innovative Training Network (ITN) for early stage researchers (ESRs) funded by the EU’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No.766186. It is based on novel synergies between nature inspired optimisation and machine learning. The training programme will be targeted at the automotive industry and ESRs employed on the program will be provided with the transferable skills necessary for thriving careers in emerging and rapidly developing industrial areas.
