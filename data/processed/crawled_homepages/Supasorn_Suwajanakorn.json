I'm Supasorn or Aek. I'm now a lecturer at VISTEC, a new research institute in Rayong, Thailand with a really nice, foresty campus. I'm looking for students, RAs/interns, postdocs, and all sorts of collaborators. Shoot me an email if you're interested. Also for PhD, please apply directly here.

I finished my Ph.D. from UW working with Prof. Steve Seitz and Prof. Ira Kemelmacher in Graphics-Vision group GRAIL. My goal is to bring computer vision out of the lab into the real world and make it really work in the wild. I went to Cornell for undergrad, and had a great pleasure working with Prof. John Hopcroft on social graph algorithms, and later got inspired by Prof. Noah Snavely with his computer vision class. I love hacking, coding, tackling hard problems, and I try very hard to make my solutions as simple as possible. Contact My first name at gmail. If I don't reply, feel free to ping me. It's likely I lost it in the pile of 30K+ mails. RESEARCH {TITLE} {AUTHORS} {CONF}{CONF2}{PRIZE}{PRIZE2} {DESC} {LIST} CON$ULTING San Francisco, CA Mountain View, CA Bangkok, Thailand San Francisco, CA WORK EXPERIENCE AI Foundation Since 2017 I'm serving as a member of the Global AI Council, AI Foundation, a San Francisco-based company focusing on applications and platforms enabled by personal AI. Google Research Intern Summer 2015 I spent a wonderful summer working with Michael Rubenstein, Ce Liu, image/video/motion analysis experts, at Google Cambridge/MIT on motion-based 3D reconstruction, and received tremendous help and input from the team with Bill Freeman, Dilip Krishnan, and Inbar Mosseri. Google Software Engineering intern Summer 2013 I lingered around Seattle in 2013 and worked with Carlos Hernandez, a 3D-vision expert, and Steve Seitz, my academic advisor, at Google Seattle in Fremont on uncalibrated depth from focus and eventually published a paper two years later. In 2010 during undergrad, I interned with Harish Venkataramani as a software engineering intern at Google Mountain View on a project related to Gmail and Google+. Cornell Student Web Programmer 2007 - 2008 I built a website for NY beginning farmer project under the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and implemented a questionnaire app that helps guide farmers to the help they need. SOURCE CODE My work consists of multiple large components with ten of thousands lines of code, so this will take time and I may not be able to provide support. The \"research-code\" is neither polished nor properly commented, but I decided to release it now for research and educational purposes. No commercial use allowed. Synthesizing Obama: Learning Lip Sync from Audio Here's the network training code that takes as input processed MFCC coefficients and outputs mouth fiducial points represented as PCA coefficients. Uncalibrated Photometric Stereo Future release. 3D Optical Flow Future release. PERSONAL My other interests include: photography, 3D printing, product design, graphics design, software dev, startup, sitting in a hammock, getting lost for fun. I play badminton and squash and sports that involve gliding and wheels such as skiing, snowboarding, skating. I flew off my bike a few times and enjoyed numerous wipe-outs from surfing, but still survived. I love hacking and building things and here are some of things I built. Light Field Bot - 3D Photosphere Supasorn Suwajanakorn An automatic DSLR rig for capturing 2D/3D 360 photosphere and dense light field for VR. The rig is controlled with Wemos D1 Mini (ESP8266). It has a joystick and OLED screen for displaying menu. The structure is aluminum and 3D printed parts, designed in Fusion 360. Software and hardware are open-source. Thingiverse Stitched OmniStereo 3D Pano High-Res 360 Spherical Camera Supasorn Suwajanakorn A prototype camera that automatically captures a 360 x 180 photosphere similar to Google Street View with resolution up to 100M pixel. It's a low-cost version ~$70 of gigapan made from a Raspberry Pi + custom 3D printed case. The camera rotates around the no-parallax point and is remotely controlled from a smartphone through a dedicated WiFi. Github UW MakerSpace Tour My Boston APT 2D Pattern to 3D Origami Popup Supasorn Suwajanakorn, Jonathan Hirschberg, Roopa Roa, Michael Tomaine Winner - The Faculty Award (Boom 2011) - Cornell University An application that lets you design a 2D pattern that can be automatically turned into a 3D foldable Origami popup model. Video Low-noise Stills from Video Supasorn Suwajanakorn, Andre Baixo Graphics Project - Graphics 2013 - UW A mobile app which combines multiple noisy shots taken hand-held into a single low-noise photo. What makes it special is that you can throw your tripod away and take pictures with your shaky hand and it will work just fine. Report Rovio & Juliet - Autonomous Indoor Navigation using SURF Jae Yong Sung, Supasorn Suwajanakorn, Jong Hwi Lee Best Project Award - Robot Learning 2011Cornell University Our goal is to make Rovio a totally autonomous robot which can follow waypoints only based on image and reach the goal position while learning and avoiding obstacles on its way. Video Report \"Mech Tournament\" Supasorn Suwajanakorn, Natachai Laohachai, Poom Pechavanish Best Game Award - 7th Thailand National Software Contest 2005 & Asia Pacific ICT Merit Awards A 2D multiplayer shooting game based on DirectX 8 and DirectPlay. You get to choose your own robot and enter a battle against other players over a LAN network or against computers with challenging AI. Classroom Controller Supasorn Suwajanakorn, Pochara Arayakarnkul Best Application Award - 6th Thailand National Software Contest 2004 An application for controlling and monitoring a computer classroom. The teacher will have the ability to inspect students' screens or any running applications, limit internet or application access, issue online quizzes or polls on any machines in the classroom. Remote Fish Feeder Supasorn Suwajanakorn, Naiyarit Sanpol, Thanapol Tanprayoon Winner - National Science Project Contest 2003 In grade 9, I built a remote fish feeding device that is connected to a home telephone line. The device can then be activated by calling home from anywhere and press a secret passcode. Fish will thank you while you're sunbathing on a beach. Google Cardboard Positional Tracking Hack Supasorn Suwajanakorn I'm trying to add positional tracking to Cardboard App (Full 6DOF). Proper calibration is needed. Tracking is done on computer and position values are sent through USB to the phone (TCP via ADB). Latency is not superb, but should be better than using phone's camera and phone's processing power. Github YouTube 3D Augmented-Reality Graphing Calculator Supasorn Suwajanakorn, Yu Cheng, Cooper Findley Showcase at Boom 2011 - Cornell Unversity Our fun app that can plot a 3D graph on a piece of paper. During the contest, some number of kids had a lot of fun hand-drawing 2D patterns e.g. hearts, their names, random arts and visualizing 3D surface in real-time. jitouch Supasorn Suwajanakorn, Sukolsak Sakshuwong Runner-Up - Ars Technica Design Award Student Mac App NYTimes / macworld An awarding-winning Mac app that expands the set of multi-touch gestures for trackpad, Magic Mouse for frequent tasks such as changing tabs in web browser, closing windows. It also recognizes handwritten alphabets as input gestures. Please check it out! Website Obox iPhone Supasorn Suwajanakorn A fast-paced puzzle game on iPhone that I made over one summer during an internship (not related). Unfortunately, it's no longer available and I did not have time to update for newer iOS. Video jiswitch Supasorn Suwajanakorn jiswitch is a free Mac application that introduces a new way to switch applications. In a nutshell, it allows users to assign any window a name, and later bring that window to the top whenever the same name is typed. This tool is meant for power-users or coders who have many windows opened. Website Designs Boom 2010 Logo Supasorn Suwajanakorn Winner - Science Showcase Logo Contest - Cornell University A logo I designed for Cornell's \"annual showcase of student research and creativity in digital technology and applications.\" I used Sunflow for global illumination rendering and Structure Synth to synthesize the model. -- Earn me an iPod touch Cornell Class of 2011 Logo Supasorn Suwajanakorn Winner - Cornell University A logo selected t",
