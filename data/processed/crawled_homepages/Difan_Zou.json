I am generally interested in machine learning, stochastic optimization, and graph learning, with a special focus on the theoretical/empirical understanding (or Physics) of deep learning (especially foundation models). I am also particularlly interested in devloping the AI/ML methods for practical problems in other area, such as signal processing, intelligent transportation, and math problems.Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. in the Computer Science department at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), supervised by Prof. Quanquan Gu. I obtained my master degree in electrical engineering and bachelor degree in applied physics, both in Unversity of Science and Technology of China (USTC).News Multiple openings for PhD, Postdoc, and RA. Please drop me an email with your CV and transcript (optional) if you are interesed in joining my research group. For interested PhD candidates in 2025, please submit your application in https://i.cs.hku.hk/~gradappl/index.html and inform me via email.
