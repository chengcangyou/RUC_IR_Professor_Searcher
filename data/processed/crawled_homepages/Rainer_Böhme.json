I was honored to co-host Advances in Financial Technologies (AFT) 2024 at the Austrian National Bank (OeNB) in the center of Vienna. After MIT and Princeton, this leading conference was back in Europe and for the first time co-located with the Economics of Payments XIII conference, where central bankers and economists meet to discuss research on payment, clearing and settlement systems. I was appointed BIS Research Fellow to help exploring the technical design space for Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Our proposal for a CBDC pyramid to guide technology policy decisions has appeared in the BIS Quartely Review. A follow-up working paper calls for a technology that upgrades money without disrupting the monetary system. The most recent essay maps out the privacy landscape for CBDC. The German banking supervisor BaFin has commissioned us to study how the disaggregation of value chains in payments may effect IT security. A summary of our results has appeared in their online magazine (in German only). Not so new, but still popular, is my recorded statement on virtual assets insurance which I gave at the Casualty Actuarial Societyâs research conference in 2020.
