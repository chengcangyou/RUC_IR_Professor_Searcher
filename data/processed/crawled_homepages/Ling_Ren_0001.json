Prior to joining the University of Illinois, I received my PhD from MIT and worked as a postdoctoral researcher at VMware Research Group. I work on applied cryptography and secure distributed algorithms. I am generally interested in designing algorithms that are both practically efficient and provably secure. As a result, my research has been as theoretical as proving asymptotic bounds, and as practical as taping out a processor. I always welcome motivated students. If you are interested in working with me, please feel free to email me, but if you have no prior experience in my areas of interest, I recommend checking out relevant graduate courses first.Email: renling at illinois dot edu.TeachingCS 539 Distributed Algorithms, Spring 2023, Fall 2024, Fall 2025.Part of the material was taught as CS 598 (Fall 2019,  Spring 2021,  Spring 2022). I initially designed this class to teach blockchains in a manner consistent with the classic theory of distributed computing. The class has been expanded to cover other aspects of distributed algorithms including shared memory systems and non-fault-tolerant algorithms. CS 461 Computer Security I, Fall 2020, Fall 2021, Fall 2022, Spring 2024, Spring 2025. ResearchCurrently, my research group focuses on threshold/distributed cryptography, cryptography for privacy protection, and fault-tolerant consensus (what most people call blockchain). I am thankful for the generous support of the National Science Foundation, Google, Meta, VMware, and Protocol Labs on our research.  Here are some of our recent works.Granular synchrony, a new network timing model that unifies the classic synchrony, partial synchrony, and asynchrony models. Here is a talk. A method to threshold cryptography secure against adaptive corruptions. We have applied it to threshold BLS signature, Schnorr signature, and El Gamal decryption.  OnionPIR, a practical single-server Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocol (updated draft and implementation in 2025). Stateful PIR with practical efficiency and optimal space-time tradeoff.    Distributed cryptography in asynchrony with practical efficiency and no trusted setup: data dissemination, reliable broadcast, verifiable information dispersal, verifiable secret sharing, distributed key generation, and q-SDH trapdoor generation. Simple and practical security analysis for Nakamoto consensus. This blog post gives an informal walk-through.Byzantine consensus with dynamic participation. This is one of the most prominent novel features of Nakamoto consensus. See this blog post and this talk for details. Byzantine consensus with minority faults: foundational algorithm, prototype system, and answer to the long-standing open problem on its optimal communication complexity.Selected Publications  (For a full list, see my Google Scholar page.)Cryptography for privacyZhikun Wang and Ling Ren.
