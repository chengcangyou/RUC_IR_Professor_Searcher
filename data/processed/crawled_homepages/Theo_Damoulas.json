I am the head of the Foundations in AI and ML (FAM) Division in CS and a Turing AI Fellow (2021-2026) having received the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Turing AI Acceleration FellowshipLink opens in a new window in order to lead research on setting the Machine Learning Foundations of Digital Twins. I am an ELLIS member and also affiliated with New York University as a Visiting Exchange Professor at the Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP). My research interests are in probabilistic machine learning and Bayesian statistics with an emphasis on the study and integration of various forms of structure and inductive biases (structured priors, spatiotemporal dependencies, dynamics, compositions, physical laws, flows, causality, etc) while advancing robust and scalable approximate inference methodologies. My research has broad applications in Digital Twins, Bayesian nonparametrics and spatiotemporal problems in urban science and computational sustainability. I am the founder and PI of the cross-departmental Warwick Machine Learning Group and in the past I led two large projects at The Turing ( Project Odysseus, London Air Quality project) that are impact stories.Projects (EPSRC, UKRI, LRF, Turing)Machine Learning Foundations of Digital Twins, UKRI, Turing AI Acceleration Fellowship, [Lead PI, 01/2021 - Present]PublicationsResearch GroupPhD StudentsYorgos Felekis (2022-2026)David Huk (2022-2026) [co-supervisors Prof. Mark Steel, Dr. Rito Dutta]Mengqi Chen (2023-2027) [co-supervisor Dr. Thomas Berrett]Loukas Sfountouris (2024-2028) [primary supervisor Dr. Paris Giampouras]Federico Perlino (2025-2029) [co-supervisor Prof. Adam Johansen]Research AssistantsTerje Mildner (2024-2025)Group AlumniDr. Jishnu Ayyangatu Kuzhiyil (PhD 2021-2025, primary supervisor Dr. Widanalage) -> [Research Scientist @Breathe Battery Technologies]Dr. Patrick O'Hara (PhD 2020-2024) -> [Research Scientist @ Amazon]Dr. Oliver Hamelijnck (PhD, 2019-2023, PDRA 2023-2025) -> [ML Research Scientist @ Speechmatics]Dr. Charita (Harita) Dellaporta (PhD, 2020-2024) -> [Research Associate @ University College London]Dr. Fabio Massimo Zenaro (PDRA, 2022-2023) -> [Associate Prof. @ University of Bergen]Dr. Maud Lemercier (PhD, 2018-2022) -> [Research Associate @ University of Oxford]Dr. Shanaka Perera (PhD, 2018-2022) -> [AI Research Scientist @ Nimbus]Nicola Branchini (RA, 2020-2021) -> [PhD student @ University of Edinburgh]James Walsh (RA, 2019-2021) -> [PhD student @ University of Cambridge]Dr. Jeremias Knoblauch (PhD, 2017-2022) -> [John Copas & ISBA Savage Award for PhD thesis, Assistant Prof. @ University College London]Dr. Virginia Aglietti (PhD, 2017-2021) -> [Harrison Award for PhD thesis, Research Scientist at DeepMind]Dr. Kangrui Wang (PDRA, 2018-2020) -> [Research Associate @ University of Cambridge]Dr. Omer Deniz Akyildiz (PDRA, 2019-2021) -> [Assistant Prof. @ Imperial College London]Dr. Ayman Boustati (PhD, 2017-2020) -> [ML Research Scientist at causaLens]Dr. Daniel Tait (PDRA, 2018-2020) -> [AI Research Scientist at Clear Dynamics]Dr. Neil Dhir (PDRA, 2019-2020) -> [Senior Research Fellow @ The Turing]Dr. Karla Monterrubio Gomez (PhD, 2016-2019) -> [Research Associate @ University of Edinburgh]Dr. Joe Meagher (PhD, 2016-2020) -> [Research Associate @ University College Dublin]Yannis Zachos (BSc thesis, 2018) -> [PhD student @ University of Cambridge]PhD SupervisionI am interested in supervising highly motivated PhD students with a strong quantitative background at the intersection of computer science and statistics (machine learning, computational statistics, applied math). See recent papers and grants for my interests and get in touch with me to discuss.BSc/MSc/MEng SupervisionEvery year I will be proposing and supervising undergraduate and master's thesis projects at both Statistics and Computer Science departments. Contact me with your CV if interested in these. If you have a well defined project of your own that is close to my interests and would like me to supervise your thesis feel free to contact me with your CV and a project description.Notable 1st Class BSc thesis: Terje Mildner, MEng in CS/Discrete Math, 3rd year Discrete Math thesis project, Outstanding 3rd year project award in CS, Partitioned/Federated Generalised Variational Inference, Dept. of Computer Science, University of Warwick, 2024.

He is a group leader in the Data Centric Engineering program at The Alan Turing Institute having served as deputy director of the program till 2021, a NERC Senior Expert, a Visiting Professor at NYU, and the founder and PI of the Warwick Machine Learning Group. His research interests are in probabilistic machine learning and Bayesian statistics with an emphasis on the study and integration of various forms of structure and inductive biases while advancing robust and scalable approximate inference methodologies.Academic trajectory:Theo joined the University of Warwick in 2015 from New York University where he was an Assistant Professor of Research (2013-2015). Before that he was a Research Associate in the department of Computer Science at Cornell University working with Prof. Carla P. Gomes, Prof. Bart Selman, Dr. Daniel Fink and the CLO eBird team headed by Steve Kelling (2009-2013). He finished his PhD thesis titled Probabilistic Multiple Kernel Learning in 2009 under the supervision of Prof. Mark A. Girolami and Prof. Cornelis Just \"Keith\" van Rijsbergen at the School of Computing Science, University of Glasgow. He holds an MSc in Informatics (Distinction) from the University of Edinburgh (2003-2004) and an MEng in Mechanical Engineering (1st Class) from the University of Manchester (1999-2003).Unsurprisingly, Theo’s academic ancestry tree goes back to Newton: Research Publications Google Scholar Teaching CS342: Machine Learning Let us know you agree to cookies We use cookies to give you the best online experience.
