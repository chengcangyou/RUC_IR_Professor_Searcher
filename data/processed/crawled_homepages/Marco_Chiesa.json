My research spans computer networking and AI-driven software systems, with a particular focus on Internet architectures, AI data centers, protocol design, and the intersection ofsecurity,privacy, andautomation. Recently, I have been exploringAI-based code generation and verification as a foundation for building more reliable, secure, and explainable systems, combining formal methods with machine learning to advance intelligent infrastructure, and applications to networking.
