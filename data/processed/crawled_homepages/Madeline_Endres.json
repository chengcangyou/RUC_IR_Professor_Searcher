My research interests lie at the intersection of Software Engineering and human factors, where I explore techniques and interventions supporting programmer productivity and wellbeing. Overall, my work uses a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods to enable developers to become experts faster and be more supported and productive. Along with core software engineering techniques, my work leverages interdisciplinary approaches from psychology and medicine to address human-factored software engineering problems. Current and recent projects include building and assessing tools based on type theory and program synthesis to support developers to write correct code more quickly, using medical imaging techniques to learn more about the cognitive basis of programming, investigating ways to support neurodiverse programmers, and studying the impact of external influences, such as psychoactive substances, on software developers. I also maintain the CS Grad Job Guide, which presents advice from several CS researchers on how to navigate the post-Ph.D. job market. When I am not doing research or mentoring students, I enjoy cooking, biking, and playing with my cat, Cleo. I also play cello, and I'm always up for improvising and swapping music recommendations! Academic Highlights January 2025: Starting as an Assistant Professor at UMass Amherst CICS August 2024: I defended my dissertation, and got my Ph.D. from the University of Michigan! May 2023 Internship at Microsoft Research, Research in Software Engineering (RISE) team, Seattle, Washington September 2020 Internship at CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security in Saarbrücken, Germany April 2020: Awarded the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship ( Personal Statement,  Research Statement) Research: Improving Programmer Productivity and Wellbeing Designing Effective Developer Training I am interested in improving programmer productivity through evidence-based educational interventions. I focus on training skills like technical reading and information search that generalize to multiple parts of software development. I thus use a variety of techniques, including both qualitative and quantitative analysis, psychological assessments, and medical imaging to better understand the cognitive factors behind such skills with the ultimate goal of helping novices become experts faster. Indicative Papers A Four-Year Study of Student Contributions to OSS vs. OSS4SG with a Lightweight Intervention (ESEC/FSE, 2022) Relating Reading, Visualization, and Coding for New Programmers: A Neuroimaging Study (ICSE, 2021) To Read or To Rotate? Comparing the Effects of Technical Reading Training and Spatial Skills Training on Novice Programming Ability (ESEC/FSE, 2021) Ongoing Projects: Using VR to teach spatial reasoning for novice programmers, and investigating cognitive causality in programming more directly using TMS Developing Efficient and Usable Programming Tools My research improves programmer productivity via the development and user-focused evaluation of programming tools for finding and fixing software defects. Leveraging techniques from program synthesis, machine learning, and automated program repair, I design efficient programming support that can help both novice and expert programmers alike write more correct code faster. Indicative Projects Seq2Parse: A neurosymbolic approach to parse error repair, combining symbolic error-correcting parsers with neural techniques (OOPSLA, 2022) InFix: A tool for automatically repairing erroneous inputs to novice Python programs (ASE, 2019). LLM4nl2post: Using LLMs to formalize natural language intent into executable postconditions (arXiv tech report, 2023) Understanding External Productivity Factors I improve programmer productivity and wellbeing through a data-driven understanding of the impact that external factors (such as gender-related bias or psychoactive substance use) have on software engineering. I believe that understanding the mechanisms and magnitudes of such environmental barriers is a necessary precursor to systematic policy reform. By gaining an evidence-based understanding of the impacts of these external factors, I hope to help developers produce higher-quality code and also feel happier while doing so. Indicative Papers From Organizations to Individuals: Psychoactive Substance Use By Professional Programmers (ICSE 2023) An Analysis of Sex Differences in Computing Teaching Evaluations (GE@ICSE, 2022) Hashing It Out: A Survey of Programmers' Cannabis Usage, Perception, and Motivation, (ICSE 2022) Ongoing Projects: A controlled study on the impact of cannabis on programming ability.
