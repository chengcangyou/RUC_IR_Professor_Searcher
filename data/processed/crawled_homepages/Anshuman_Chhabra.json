Prior to joining USF, I received my PhD in Computer Science from UC Davis.My research focuses on (1) methods for augmenting the utility, robustness, and security properties of AI/ML models (e.g. LLMs), thereby making them more safe and trustworthy; (2) developing scalable data-centric learning approaches that provide (a) interpretability and (b) performance improvements, while being (c) model-agnostic; and (3) utilizing these methods for improving AI adoption and usage in real-world interdisciplinary domains. Email: anshumanc[at]usf[dot]eduFind me on: Github || Google Scholar || Twitter/XI am looking to recruit exceptional PhD students, visiting scholars, and remote interns to work on research relating to (1) Data-centric methods for Generative AI, (2) Multimodal AI, (3) AI/ML safety, and (4) Reasoning Models. Please visit the PALM Lab webpage for more details.RECENT NEWS:9/18/2025: Our paper \"LayerIF: Estimating Layer Quality for Large Language Models using Influence Functions\" was accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Main Conference [pdf]8/28/2025: Invited to serve as an Area Chair for ICLR 2026.5/15/2025: Our paper \"Re-ranking Using Large Language Models for Mitigating Exposure to Harmful Content on Social Media Platforms\" was accepted to ACL 2025 Main Conference [pdf][code]5/1/2025: Selected as an outstanding reviewer for ICML 2025 [link]5/1/2025: Our paper \"Outlier Gradient Analysis: Efficiently Identifying Detrimental Training Samples for Deep Learning Models\" was accepted as an oral talk (top 1% of papers) at ICML 2025 Main Conference [pdf][code]1/22/2025: Our paper \"Watching the AI Watchdogs: A Fairness and Robustness Analysis of AI Safety Moderation Classifiers\" was accepted at the NAACL 2025 Main Conference [pdf][code]1/22/2025: Our paper \"Assessing LLMs for Zero-shot Abstractive Summarization Through the Lens of Relevance Paraphrasing\" was accepted at the NAACL 2025 Conference (Findings) [pdf][code]9/24/2024: Our submission (PQN) to the Prosocial Ranking Challenge organized by UC Berkeley (Berkeley Center for Human-Compatible AI) was selected as one of the top three ranker finalists in the competition!
