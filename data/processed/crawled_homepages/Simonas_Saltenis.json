Tranders area) Research I work in the Center for Data-intensive Systems (DAISY). My area of research covers indexing and query porcessing of spatial and spatiotemporal data. An interesting example of spatiotemporal data is positions of continuously moving objects. Efficient algorithms on modern hardware, such as multi-core CPUs, is also an area of my research. I am also interested in various other database related topics, algorithms, and data structures.
