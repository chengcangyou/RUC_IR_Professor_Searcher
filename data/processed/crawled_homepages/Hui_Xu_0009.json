My research focuses on program analysis and software reliability, with an emphasis on Rust code analysis. Before joining Fudan University, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, supported by the CUHK Postdoctoral Research Fellowship. I also received my Ph.D. degree from CUHK, supervised by Prof. Michael Lyu. Before my academic career, I worked in industry as a security professional for several years after obtaining my M.Sc. degree from Hong Kong University, and B.Eng and B.M degrees from China University of Geosciences (Beijing). Email: xuh[AT]fudan.edu.cn I am looking for self-motivated students (Ph.D., master, intern, or FYP). Please drop me an email if you are interested. 博士、硕士研究生报名请选择：计算机科学与技术=>智能网络与系统学科方向. Textbook 编译授课笔记 On-going Project: RAPx: RAPx is a Static Program Analysis Platform for analyzing Rust Crates. The tool is taking part in the verify-rust-std challenge. Tracing-based methodology for unsafe code verification. Rationale for the methodology’s soundness: A Trace-based Approach for Code Safety Analysis. tag-std: The project aims to define appropriate safety properties for the unsafe APIs in the Rust standard library. We proposed this RFC to the Rust community. System of safety properties in Rust.
