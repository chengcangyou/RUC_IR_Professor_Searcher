Box 208285 New Haven, CT 06520 Website: Graph and Geometric Learning Lab About Rex (Zhitao) Ying Degrees Ph.D., Stanford University B.S., Duke University Perspectives For latest news about my lab, visit my lab website: Graph and Geometric Learning Lab Real-world data can often be expressed in the ubiquitous language of graph, a general concept of entities connected by relations. I focus on developing expressive, scalable and explainable algorithms that incorporate and leverage such relational inductive bias for data expressed as graph structure, via graph neural networks and geometric learning. I have worked on graph learning applications in recommender system, anomaly detection, social network analysis, protein networks, drug discovery, physical simulations and many more.
