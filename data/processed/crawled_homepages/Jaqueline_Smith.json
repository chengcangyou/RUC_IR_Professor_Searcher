I am unlikely to respond to email while on leave. If you are a student in one of my courses, the best way to contact me is using the email address posted on the relevant course website, and not using my personal email address. I am an Associate Professor, Teaching Stream in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto. In 2021, I was awarded the University of Toronto's Early Career Teaching Award. Prior to joining UofT in 2015, I taught at the University of Alberta. I completed my MSc in Computing Science at the U of A in 2011 and have been teaching a variety of CS courses since 2012. My primary interests are in teaching introductory CS classes, and fostering an inclusive classroom environment. I am also interested in teaching about teaching CS, particularly for teaching assistants and new faculty. My office is BA4262, and you can find my office hours on the related course webpage. I typically hold my office hours in the CS Help Centre.
