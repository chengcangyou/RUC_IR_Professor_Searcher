Email: my first name@ai.iitkgp.ac.in \"The test of all knowledge is experiment. Experiment is the sole judge of scientific truth.\" -- Richard Feynman. \"In mathematics you do not understand things, you just get used to them.\" -- John Von Neumann. Buffon said unreservedly, \"Genius is simply patience carried to the extreme.\" To those who asked how he achieved fame, he replied: \"By spending forty years of my life bent over my writing desk.” -- Advice for a Young Investigator By Santiago Cajal Academic Interests | Publications | Projects | Teaching | Students Academic Interests I try to work on Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Big Data Processing, and ML-driven Artificial Intelligence. Computer Programming, efficient data structures and algorithm design are other areas I immensely enjoy. In fact, my interest in this area has been so intense, I wanted to do my PhD research on algorithms (though, for several reasons, that did not materialize). Nonetheless, my voluntary digression did not deter me from keeping my love intact for this beautiful area of computer science. Teaching is equally enjoyable to me. I love to teach the subjects on Machine Learning/Deep Learning, Mathematical Foundations for ML/Data Science, Computer Programming, Data Structure and Algorithm Design.
