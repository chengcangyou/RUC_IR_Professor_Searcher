I’m also an Adjunct Associate Professor of Linguistics in the College of Arts & Sciences. Before coming to Indiana, I was a Neukom Fellow at the Neukom Institute for Computational Science and the Leslie Center for the Humanities at Dartmouth College. My research explores the uses of statistics and machine learning in the study of very large text collections (of novels, academic journals, book reviews, newspapers, etc.). Much of my recent work falls under the heading of sociology of literature. News: 2024-08-01 On leave from Indiana University.
