About Me - Ph.D. Computer Science I am an Assistant Professor in Computer Science & Engineering at Texas A&M University, and a member of the Center for Remote Health Technologies & Systems. I currently have several openings with my group for highly motivated and driven students in all areas of our group's research including: clinical outcomes research, machine learning, embedded systems design, and internet of things research, to name a few! If you are interested in joining the team, please read through this page Prior to joining Texas A&M, I was a postdoctoral associate under the supervision of Prof. Harlan Krumholz at the Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation (CORE) and Prof. Sahand Negahban of the Department of Statistics. I worked as a graduate student (and earned my Ph.D.) in Computer Science under the supervision of Prof. Majid Sarrafzadeh at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Wireless Health Institute (2014). I earned a B.A. in Applied Mathematics and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the Univeristy of California Berkeley (2007). My research interests include end-to-end research on medical embedded systems and the application of data mining and machine learning algorithms necessary to make personalized, preventative medical treatments possible through advanced health analytics . My background is in embedded systems design, where I studied sensor fusion, reconfigurable architectures and systems, hardware accelerators, and gpu computing. During my Ph.D. I applied data mining and machine learning techniques to these systems to develop a personalized, exercise-level activity-recognition video game with wearable sensors. I am now primarily concerned with the ability to use supervised and unsupervised techniques to learn more about medical prediction and risk-stratification in order to better develop personalized medical systems, prediction models, comparative effectiveness techniques, and combine wearable sensors and other necessary data to make a clinical impact at the system level, provider level, and patient level. My office: 328A HRBB College Station, TX 06510 Office: (979) 458-2642 Back to top Research Currently, my interdisciplinary work involves bridging of computer science with the medical research realm, particularly in Patient-Centered Outcomes Research. For example, I have worked on projects ranging from Personalized Activity Recognition for exergaming, exercise repetition, rehabilitation and nutrition monitoring (while at UCLA) to Remote Monitoring and Clinical prediction in clinical settings using Clinical Trial Data, Clinical Registry Data, and Clinical Electronic Health Record Data (while at Yale). These projects investigate system design, user adherence and cheating, risk prediction, comparative effectiveness, and a deeper understanding and evaluation of clinical questions and challenges at a patient-centered outcomes focus.
