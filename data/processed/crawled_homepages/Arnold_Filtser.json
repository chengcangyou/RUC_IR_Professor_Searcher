About Me I am a faculty member at the Computer Science Department at Bar-Ilan University. Prior to joining Bar Ilan, I was a postdoc at the Computer Science Department at Columbia University, hosted by Alex Andoni. The postdoc was part of the the Simons Collaboration on Algorithms and Geometry. I did my PhD at the Computer Science Department at Ben Gurion University of the Negev. I was fortunate to be advised by Ofer Neiman and Robert Krauthgamer. My research stands at the exciting intersection of algorithms, geometry, and graph theory. Broadly speaking, my work focuses on summarization of geometric data. That is, ways to organize data of geometric nature in more manageable forms that could be utilized for algorithmic design. Some key words: low-distortion metric embeddings, stochastic decompositions, spanners, approximation algorithms, streaming algorithms, online algorithms, and computational geometry. I am recruiting excellent graduate students to our research group. If you are interested, don't hesitate to shoot me an email! Check out our Bar-Ilan Theory seminar ! Check out our FOCS 2022 workshop “ Advances on Metric Embeddings ” I co-organized with Hung Le. There are video recordings of all the talks!
