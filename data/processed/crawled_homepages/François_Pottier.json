Quotes: Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety. -- Benjamin Franklin (1755) Beaucoup de mal durable est souvent fait par les choses provisoires. -- Victor Hugo (1848) Chacun appelle idÃ©es claires celles qui sont au mÃªme degrÃ© de confusion que les siennes propres. -- Marcel Proust Tough ain't enough. -- Frankie Remind me to come here next time I want my constitution undermined. -- Egbert Calling it your job don't make it right, boss. -- Cool Hand Luke Research: lists of my publications, software, and talks; the papers I have cited define my interests (.bib file); Teaching: I teach part of (and am the head of) the course on functional programming and type systems (also known under the nicknames 2.4 and FUN) at MPRI; I once taught at Ãcole Polytechnique. The material for the following two courses remains available: compilation (INF564); “advanced programming” (INF441) in Java and OCaml. Activities: organizer of our group's seminar; in charge of the PhD committee (CSD) at Inria Paris; member of IFIP Working Group 2.8 on Functional Programming; member of IFIP Working Group 2.16 on Language Design. Upcoming events: JFLA 2026 (member of the program committee); ITP 2026 (member of the program committee). Current software (gitlab): Menhir, an LR(1) parser generator for the OCaml programming language (documentation) (mailing list); Sek, an OCaml library that offers efficient ephemeral and persistent sequences, co-authored with Arthur CharguÃ©raud (documentation); Monolith, a tool that helps perform random testing or fuzz testing of an arbitrary OCaml library (documentation); Visitors, an OCaml syntax extension that generates object-oriented visitors for traversing and transforming data structures (documentation); Inferno, an OCaml library for ML type inference and elaboration, described in my ICFP 2014 paper (documentation) (mailing list); Fix, an OCaml library for memoization, hash-consing, and computing least fixed points (documentation); PPrint, an OCaml library for pretty-printing tree-structured textual data (documentation); Feat, an OCaml library for counting, enumerating and sampling inhabitants of algebraic data types (documentation); UnionFind, an OCaml library that offers several implementations of this famous data structure, including a concurrent union-find data structure (documentation); FlatUnionFind, an OCaml library that offers a union-find data structure inside a vector (documentation); Oma, an OCaml library that offers an order maintenance data structure (documentation); Baby, an OCaml library that offers fast sets and maps based on balanced binary search trees (documentation); Hector, an OCaml library that offers fast vectors (also known as resizeable arrays), including very fast integer vectors (documentation); Hachis, an OCaml library that offers fast and compact hash tables (documentation); IntPQueue, an OCaml library that offers fast and compact priority queues with low integer priorities (documentation); Loop, a Coq library for writing a do/while loop, while producing clean OCaml extracted code. Not-so-current software: (2014) Mezzo, a prototype programming language that I have developed together with Jonathan Protzenko; (2013) dblib, a Coq library for dealing with binding using de Bruijn indices (README) (archive); (2010) FORK, an extension of System F Omega with well-behaved Recursive Kinds; (2009) my Connect 4 player; (2007) Pure FreshML, a prototype programming language that I have toyed with; (2006) Cαml, a tool that helps deal with α-conversion in OCaml programs; (2006) a prototype implementation for the book chapter The Essence of ML Type Inference, by Yann RÃ©gis-Gianas, Didier RÃ©my, and myself; (2001) my simple-minded 5-in-a-row player; (2000) Wallace, a library for generating and simplifying subtyping constraints; (2000) my World Wide Web link checker Big Brother; (1998) my Macintosh software. My current and former Ph.D. students are: Mathis Bouverot-Dupuis (2025-), co-advised by Yannick Forster and myself Remy Seassau (2023-), Tiago Soares (2023-) (co-advised by MÃ¡rio Pereira and myself), ClÃ©ment Allain (2022-), Alexandre Moine (2021-2024) (co-advised by Arthur CharguÃ©raud and myself) (now a postdoctoral researcher at New York University), Olivier Martinot (2020-2024), (co-advised by Gabriel Scherer and myself), Paulo EmÃ­lio de Vilhena (2019-2022) (now a postdoctoral researcher at Imperial College London), FrÃ©dÃ©ric Bour (2019-2024), Glen MÃ©vel (2018-2022) (co-advised by Jacques-Henri Jourdan and myself), Naomi Testard (2017-2019), ArmaÃ«l GuÃ©neau (2016-2019) (co-advised by Arthur CharguÃ©raud and myself) (now a researcher at Inria Saclay), Jonathan Protzenko (2010-2014) (now a researcher at Microsoft Research in Redmond), Nicolas Pouillard (2008-2011) (now a free-lance programmer and researcher), Alexandre Pilkiewicz (2008-2011) (now at Google France), Arthur CharguÃ©raud (2007-2010) (now a researcher at Inria Strasbourg), Yann RÃ©gis-Gianas (2004-2007) (now at Nomadic Labs), Nadji Gauthier (2003-2005), Vincent Simonet (2000-2004) (now at Google France). Photos: working at night doubles my productivity; my daughter Lola's 2005 album; Back to Corsica, an album with text and photos; older, sparsely commented photos of Corsica, Mercantour, and PyrÃ©nÃ©es; the body language of one our math professors at ENS, around 1993. Leisure: I am a member (and the webmaster) of the Choucas Cellois, a mountain biking club West of Paris. Home Email",
