ProfessorDepartment of Computer Science co-director CS Graphics and Applied Perception Lab OfficeGOLISANO Hall - Room 3527 EmailJoe.Geigel AT rit.edu Phone(585) 475-2051 Joe Geigel is a Professor of Computer Science at the Rochester Institute of Technology and co-director of the CS Graphics and Applied Perception Lab at RIT. He received his doctorate in Computer Science in 2000 from the George Washington University in Washington D.C. Previous to his academic career, Joe held a variety of research and development positions in industry at companies including Eastman Kodak, Bell Laboratories, Bellcore, and RCA Solid State. Just prior to joining the faculty at RIT, Joe was a Senior Web technologist at theatre.com / BroadwayOnLine.com where he applied 3D Web technologies to theatrical applications. His main research efforts have focused on interdisciplinary multimedia projects that that combine computer science, real-time graphics, mobile devices, art, music, and theatre to create interactive live experiences, collaborating with artists, designers, musician and photographers from both within RIT and externally. He uses these projects as a springboard for interdisciplinary education promoting collaboration and teamwork between artists and technologists. In addition to his work on these experiences, Joe has published in the areas of tone reproduction, virtual reality, facial motion capture, sound synthesis, multimedia systems, applied perception, and curricular design for graphics education. He currently teaches graduate and undergraduate classes focusing on Computer Graphics, Global Illumination, Animation, Virtual Reality, and Interactive Musical Experiences. He also runs the Vertically Integrated Project XRLive, which focuses on the use of advanced technologies in live performance. Joe is an active and long time member of ACM/SIGGRAPH and a SIGGRAPH Pioneer. He is also an avid fan of Broadway musicals and pop music culture.
