Juarez ORCID: 0000-0003-1776-1992 Research Areas Medical AI I research on cutting edge AI technologies, such as machine learning, reinforcement and deep learning, for solving clinical problems in real life scenarios. This research aims to help doctors and patients to have a better healthcare service. eXplainable AI My research on eXplainable AI (XAI) helps me understand how AI systems make decisions, so I can trust and use them more confidently. When I know why/how an AI gave an answer, I can spot errors or biases and feel more secure relying on its help.
