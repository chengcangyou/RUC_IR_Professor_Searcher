C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Lehigh University. My research focuses primarily on structural bioinformatics. I am the principal investigator of the Informatics Lab. Academic Background I was a postdoctoral research scientist at Barry Honig's Lab at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, and the Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at Columbia University. At Columbia, I gained considerable exposure to research in structural biology, biophysics, and protein crystallography. I earned a Ph.D. from Rice University's Department of Computer Science for my work on protein function annotation. My advisor was Dr. Lydia Kavraki. While at Rice, I had the pleasure to learn quite a bit about structural bioinformatics, robotics, graphics, and distributed systems. I received a B.A. in Mathematics and a B.A. in Computer Science from Rutgers College at Rutgers University, the State University of New Jersey, in 2000. While at Rutgers, I had the opportunity to do a summer project with János Komlós, and some signal processing with William Craelius. Image Credit: Ryan Hulvat, 2010. Copyright 2009 Brian Y.
