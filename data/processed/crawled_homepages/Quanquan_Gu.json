I am leading the UCLA Artificial General Intelligence Lab. I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2014. My research is in artificial intelligence and machine learning, with a focus on nonconvex optimization, deep learning, reinforcement learning, Large Language Models (LLMs), and deep generative models (e.g., diffusion models). Recently, I have been utilizing AI to enhance scientific discovery in domains such as biology, medicine, chemistry, and public health. Here is my latest CV.
