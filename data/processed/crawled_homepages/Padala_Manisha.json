These include exploring different fairness measures, developing fair and private classifiers, and investigating fairness in federated settings. We also look at the problem of Fair Resource Allocation under the presence of ExternalitiesMechanism Design and Deep Learning - we look at designing mechanisms to build systems that are resistant to manipulations from strategic agents. The mechanisms are designed to ensure certain efficiency and fairness criteria in different context, like auctions, crowdfunding and resource allocationGoogle SitesReport abuseGoogle SitesReport abuse",
