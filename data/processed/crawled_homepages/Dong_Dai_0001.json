My research interests are in optimizing and designing intelligent infrastructure for high-performance data-intensive systems, such as parallel file systems, metadata management, graph storage, and resource management. I direct the Data Intelligence Research Lab (DIRLab)The complete paper list can be seen in Google Scholar or my CV. Below is list of representative publications. (Note * are Ph.D, Master, or Undergraduate students mentored by me.)Selected PublicationsIOAgent: Democratizing Trustworthy HPC I/O Performance Diagnosis Capability via LLMsChris Egersdoerfer*, Arnav Sareen, Jean Luca Bez, Suren Byna, Dongkuan (DK) Xu, Dong DaiIPDPS, 2025Github Repo, TalkThis paper proposes IOAgent as a systematic effort to democratize trustworthy HPC I/O performance diagnosis capability to HPC users and domain scientists via LLMs. From a Darshan trace, IOAgent provides high-quality diagnosis on what could be the I/O issue of the execution.Be Aware of Metadata Corruption in Parallel File System: It Can Be Silent and CatastrophicSaisha Kamat*, Mai Zheng, Bo Fang, Dong Dai, ,IPDPS, 2025Github Repo, TalkThis study systematically examines what would happen to HPC applications when there are metadata corruptions in parallel file system (Lustre). We observed critical silent errors to applications and proposed a runtime metadata checker to address the issue. AdapTBF: Decentralized Bandwidth Control via Adaptive Token Borrowing for HPC StorageMd. Hasanur Rashid*, Dong DaiIPDPS, 2025Github Repo, TalkThis study proposes a new approach to realize bandwidth control on shared HPC storage system. Specifically, building on the well-established TBF mechanism in modern parallel file systems (e.g., Lustre), we propose AdapTBF, a decentralized bandwidth control approach using an adaptive borrowing and lending mechanism.Understanding and Predicting Cross-Application I/O  Interference in HPC Storage SystemsChris Egersdoerfer*, Md. Hasanur Rashid*, Dong Dai, Bo Fang, Tallent Nathan,PDSW@SC, 2024Github Repo, TalkIn this study, we build the first machine learning model and its framework to quantatively understand and predict the cross-application I/O interference in shared HPC storage systems (e.g., Lustre).QualityNet: Error-bounded Lossy Compression Quality Prediction via Deep SurrogateKhondoker Mirazul Mumenin*, Dong Dai, Jinzhen Wang, Sheng DiBigData, 2024Github Repo, Talk, TBAThis paper proposes a surrogate-based framework to predict key compression quality assessment metrics, allowing users to evaluate the quality of compressed data quickly without extensive trial and error.ION: Navigating the HPC I/O Optimization Journey using Large Language ModelsChris Egersdoerfer*, Arnav Sareen*, Jean Luca Bez, Suren Byna, Dong Dai,HotStorage, 2024Github Repo, TalkIn this study, we explored how large language models can help understand complex I/O logs and diagnose potential I/O issues.An Empirical Study of Machine Learning-based Synthetic Job Trace Generation Methods.Monish Soundar Raj*, Thomas MacDougall*, Di Zhang*, Dong Dai,JSSPP, 2024Github Repo, TalkIn this study, we empirically study how to use generative models to generate batch job traces and identify the best models via empirical comparisons.Cross-System Analysis of Job Characterization and Scheduling in Large-Scale Computing ClustersDi Zhang*, Monish Soundar Raj*, Bing Xie, Sheng Di, Dong Dai,IPDPS, 2024Github Repo, Web App, TalkWe conduct a comparative study of multiple workloads in HPC and AI clusters. Based on the analysis, we have eight takeaways that can be used for designing better schedulers.DGAP: Efficient Dynamic Graph Analysis on Persistent MemoryAbdullah Al Raqibul Islam*, Dong Dai,SC, 2023Github RepoWe propose a novel graph analysis framework, DGAP, to efficiently support dynamic graph analysis on Optane persistent memory. DGAP leverages PMA-based array and PMEM-specific optimizations to deliver better performance than state-of-the-art solutions.A Reinforcement Learning Based Backfilling Strategy for HPC Batch Jobsthe original paper has been updated with minor corrections.Elliot Kolker-Hicks*, Di Zhang*, Dong Dai,PMBS@SC, 2023Github Repo (code has been updated)We show better job runtime prediction does not always lead to better backfilling, and propose to use reinforcement learning to learn an optimized backfilling strategy.Early Exploration of Using ChatGPT for Log-based Anomaly Detection on Parallel File Systems LogsChris Egersdoerfer*, Di Zhang*, Dong Dai,HPDC (poster), 2023We explore to use ChatGPT for log-based anomaly detection on parallel file systems logs. It shows promising accuracy and understanding about the logs.Drill: Log-based Anomaly Detection for Large-scale Storage Systems Using Source Code Analysis.Di Zhang*, Chris Egersdoerfer*, Tabassum Mahmud, Mai Zheng, Dong Dai,IPDPS, 2023Github Repo / talkDrill is a state-of-the-art log-based anomaly detection system for large-scale storage systems using both content and context of the logs.FaultyRank: A Graph-based Parallel File System CheckerSaisha Kamat*, Abdullah Al Raqibul Islam*, Mai Zheng, Dong Dai,IPDPS, 2023Github Repo / talkFaultyRank is the first graph-based parallel file system checker that can detect and fix metadata inconsistencies and corruptions. It runs faster and more accurate than the state-of-the-art checker.VCSR: Mutable CSR Graph Format Using Vertex-Centric Packed Memory ArrayAbdullah Al Raqibul Islam*, Dazhao Cheng, Dong Dai,CCGRID, 2022Github Repo / talkVCSR is a new mutable CSR graph format using packed memory array. Its new vertex-centric design enables fast graph updates and efficient graph traversal.SchedInspector: A Batch Job Scheduling Inspector Using Reinforcement LearningDi Zhang*, Dong Dai, Bing Xie,HPDC, 2022Github Repo / talkSchedInspector opportunistically delays ready jobs to improve the overall performance of the existing job scheduling policies via reinforcement learning.A Study of Failure Recovery and Logging of High-Performance Parallel File SystemsRunzhou Han, Om Rameshwar Gatla, Mai Zheng, Jinrui Cao, Di Zhang*, Dong Dai, Yong Chen, Jonathan Cook,TOS, 2022A comprehensive review of PFault, our ICS'18 paper.SentiLog: Anomaly Detecting on Parallel File Systems via Log-based Sentiment AnalysisDi Zhang*, Dong Dai, Runzhou Han, Mai Zheng,HotStorage, 2021, Best Paper NomineeGithub Repo / talkSentiLog proposes to use sentiment analysis to detect anomalies on parallel file systems.RLScheduler: An AutomatedHPC Batch Job Scheduler Using Reinforcement LearningDi Zhang*, Dong Dai, Youbiao He, Forrest Sheng Bao, Bing Xie,SC, 2020Github Repo / talkRLScheduler uses reinforcement learning (PPO) to automaticlaly learn a batch job scheduler.
