I have spent a few years as a postdoctoral fellow at Haifa, Israel. I was honored to be hosted by Prof. Dan Feldman (Haifa University) and Prof. Nir Ailon (Technion). Prior to this, I earned my PhD from the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar in the Department of Computer Science. I was very fortunate to have Prof. Anirban Dasgupta as my advisor, with whom I worked on streaming coresets for various machine learning algorithms.ResearchMy research focuses on improving the efficiency of various machine learning and deep learning algorithms by constructing coresets (data or model summarizations with provable theoretical guarantees). I am interested in theoretical and practical use cases of different coreset construction frameworks. I have a strong interest in the diverse applications of coresets within federated learning and knowledge graph domains.Latest EventsNomited as Young S&T Leaders by ESTIC, DST.Improved Coresets for Vertical Federated Learning: Regularized Linear and Logistic Regressions (Poster) at ICML 2025.Received PM ECRG from ANRF in 2025.Google SitesReport abusePage detailsPage updated Google SitesReport abuse",
