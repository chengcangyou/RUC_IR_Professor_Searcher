I am now all the more curious about the origin, evolution and development of fundamental cognitive abilities (e.g. language acquisition, aesthetic-sense, time-space continuum, spontaneous thought, contemplation) across all living species... Of late I have begun wondering about the evolutionary origins of all forms of art, artistic behavior, learning, creativity, imagination and sense of aesthetics, and how an amalgamation of all of these processes lead to embodied experiences.... I would love to be part of transdisciplinary science-writing/research initiatives/projects in any/all of these areas... One can find a brief on my research interests and attempts here, and on a few other issues that interest me, here.  When at work, I should be somewhere around 26.4711° N, 73.1134° E. If you would like to write to me, please address them to [rm<dot>banerjee<at>gmail<dot>com] or [romibanerjee<at>iitj<dot>ac<dot>in]. Thank you :-)...Google SitesReport abuseGoogle SitesReport abuse",
