Welcome (again)!I am a tenure-track Junior (=Assistant) Professor of Technology-Enhanced Learning in the Department of Computer Science at Saarland University in Germany. I am also a Faculty Associate at Harvard University’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society in the US. I direct the interdisciplinary LaLa Lab (“Learning to Adapt, Learning with Agency Lab”).I am a learning scientist working with education stakeholders to support meaningful human learning activities with technologies. I co-design intelligent technologies and novel learning strategies with educators and learners, and conduct school-based experimental studies and qualitative studies to understand and support human learning. I have explored topics such as:Co-designing novel interaction strategies with teachers to help children reason with, and learn from, visual representations in an intelligent systemSupporting learners’ self-regulated choice-making behaviors in an intelligent systemUnderstanding school students’ perception and preferences for learning with AIDesigning an educational game to support engaging and effective learning in mathI received my Ph.D. in Human-Computer Interaction from Carnegie Mellon University’s HCI Institute in the US in 2022, working with Dr. Vincent Aleven. Prior to attending CMU, I completed my Master’s degree in Learning, Design, and Technology at Stanford Graduate School of Education, working with Dr. Candace Thille.I am also an activist working in the area of open education as a member of Creative Commons Japan and as an OER Research Fellow at Open Education Group.🚀JOIN OUR TEAM!🚀Thesis students [see here] CV Research Lab Teaching Schullehrer Research Learn algebra with mindful \"Maddox\" Supporting informed choice making Children's understanding of AI More research Recent Publications🆕 Su, M., Dang, B., Nguyen, A., & Nagashima, T.
