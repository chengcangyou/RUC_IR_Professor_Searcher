To capture, analyse and engineer these effects, I work with a wide range of techniques from the fields of control theory, machine learning, and game theory.My more recent research focuses on two directions: How information affects interaction, and how it may be used as a means of control The use of environment dynamics manipulation to influence learning algorithmsAnnouncementsWatch this space for research/grant related announcements.[Jobs] Following my move to Carleton University, I am looking to recruit MSc and PhD students. Find my email here and drop me a note if you're interested.Short BioI am currently a member of the School of Computer Science faculty at the Carleton University, Ottawa, where I have moved from the Nanyang Technological University.My prior experience also includes: the Research and Development Department of Mobileye Vision Technologies Ltd.; a Postdoctoral Researcher appointment at the Department of Computer Science at the Bar-Ilan University; and a Research Fellow position with the School of Electronics and Computer Sciences at the University of Southampton. Ph.D. in Computer Science was conferred on me by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2008, based on my thesis. My M.Sc. thesis and undergrad studies in Computer Sciences and Mathematics were also completed at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.Report abuseReport abuse",
