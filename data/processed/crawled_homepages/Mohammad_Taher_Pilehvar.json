Previously, I was an Assistant Professor at Tehran Institute for Advanced Studies (TeIAS). I also hold an Affiliated Lecturer position at the University of Cambridge. My primary research interest lies in the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP) where I have worked on different problems in lexical semantics, such as semantic representation and similarity, sense representation, word sense disambiguation, and ontology construction and alignment. [google scholar] [twitter] Background Iran University of Science and Technology I was an Assistant Professor at the Computer Engineering department of IUST (2018-2020). During this time, I taught multiple graduate and undergraduate courses (AI, Deep Learning, NLP, and Advanced Programming) and supervised several graduate students. University of Cambridge I was a Research Associate at the Language Technology Lab of the University of Cambridge (2015-2018). During this, I worked on PheneBank (PI: Dr. Nigel Collier), a project at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Biomedical sciences, funded by the UK's Medical Research Council. Sapienza University I did my PhD at the Linguistic Computing Laboratory of the Sapienza University of Rome, Italy. My PhD advisor was Dr. Roberto Navigli with whom I did research in lexical semantics with a specific focus on the unified semantic representation of different linguistic items.
