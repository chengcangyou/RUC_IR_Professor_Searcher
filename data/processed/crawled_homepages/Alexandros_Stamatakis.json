We understand Bioinformatics as a discipline that develops algorithms, models, and tools that help Biologists to generate new biological insights and knowledge. We try to bridge the gap between the world of systematics and the world of high performance computing. Due to the increasing descrepancy between the pace of molecular data accumulation and increase in CPU speeds (which is much slower), which we call the \"Bio-Gap\" we feel that the time has come to establish parallel computing as standard technique in Bioinformatics. 2025 Computational Molecular Evolution Summer School in Crete Applications for the 2025 summer school on computational molecular evolution in Heraklion, Crete are now open. Application deadline: November 1st, 2024 New Software Pandora Uncertainty estimation toolkit for dimensionality reduction on population genetics data. It is available for download here. Pythia A tool to predict the difficulty of phylogenetic analysis of Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSA). It is available for download here. Lagrange-NG Attention Biogeographers! We just released Lagrange-NG, a re-design of the popular Lagrange tool: it's faster, runs in parallel, and has better code quality: SoftWipe A tool and benchmark for assessing adherence of scientific software to coding quality standards. It is available for download here. NetRAX A tool for accurate and fast maximum likelihood based inference of phylogenetic networks. It is available for download here. SpeciesRax A tool for maximum likelihood species tree inference from gene family trees under duplication, transfer, and loss. It is available for download here. SCRAPP Species Counting on Reference trees viA Phylogenetic Placements - bridging the gap between phylogenetic placement results and alpha diversity metrics, with the possibility of further in-depth analysis. It is available for download here RootDigger RootDigger uses a non-reversible Markov model to compute the most likely root location on a given tree. It is available for download here GeneRax: Species tree-aware maximum likelihood based gene tree inference under gene duplication, transfer, and loss Our first tool for gene tree species tree reconciliation. Open-source code is available here, a respective preprint can be found here. ParGenes: massively parallel inference of gene trees A tool for massively parallel model selection and phylogenetic tree inference on thousands of genes using thousands of cores, based on ModelTest-NG and RAxML-NG. Now published in Bionformatics and available for download here. RAxML-NG Web-Server The brand new web-server for the completely re-designed version of RAxML, called RAxML-NG is available here. RAxML-NG The latest version of RAxML-NG, the complete re-design of RAxML can be found at Alexey's github repository. RAxML questions, help & bug reports: please use the RAxML google group The respective paper can be found here Students from KIT We are always looking for student programmers (HiWis) and students interested in doing bachelor/master theses projects with us.
