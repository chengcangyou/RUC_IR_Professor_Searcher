News June 2025, Honored to receive Best Paper Award in IEEE Cloud Summit 2025! Congratulations to my students who worked tirelessly in the KubeLLM research project. Thanks to our Sponsors: US Department of Energy and UTSA School of Data Science. May 2025, Our paper \"LLM-Based Multi-Agent Framework For Troubleshooting Distributed Systems\" is accepted at IEEE Cloud Summit 2025. Congratulations to Mario, Perfect, William, and Aaron! Three of the co-authors are undergraduate students. September 2024, Funded from NIH on \"Expanding Genomic Data Science Access via Cloud Computing and Dynamic Learning Modules. Total award amount $474,136.\" Research Interests Publications AI and Cloud Systems Lab Teaching Professional Services Awards Research Interests Cloud and Edge Computing Artificial Intelligence Cyber Security The rapid evolution and expansion of Internet services present significant challenges for computer scientists, who strive to make these systems more scalable, secure, reliable, and efficient. As the complexity of these systems grows, there is an increasing need to make them self-adaptive and autonomous, reducing human intervention and improving their resilience. Dr. Lama's research focuses on addressing these challenges by working at the synergistic intersection of AI, Cloud and Edge Computing. His work emphasizes developing innovative systems and middleware solutions that enhance the performance, energy efficiency, and security of distributed computing systems. Central to his research is the dual concept of AI for Systems - harnessing AI to automate and optimize system operations and Systems for AI - designing middleware and system software that support scalable, energy-efficient deployment of AI models in resource-constrained environments.
