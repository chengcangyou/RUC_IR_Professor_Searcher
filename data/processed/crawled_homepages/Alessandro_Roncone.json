Please visit my lab's website [LINK] Alessandro Roncone I am a robotics engineer, a computer scientist, and a team lead. [CV] Who am I My work lies at the intersection of Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and Human-Robot Interaction with the goal of developing robot technologies that enable close, natural, and extended cooperation with humans. I aim at lowering the barriers to entry for humans to naturally interact with robots, and in doing so I design human-aware robot systems that are able to work with and around people. To me, the engineering is as important as the science: I make robots work, and I hold a deep commitment to doing so while implementing scalable, robust, and elegant systems. 17 years’ research experience in Humanoid Robotics, Human-Robot Interaction and Artificial Intelligence. Director of the Human Interaction and RObotics [HIRO] Group at CU Boulder, where I lead a team of ~20 graduate and undergraduate students to perform state-of-the-art research. Proven ability to manage multiple projects and supervise multiple people while meeting challenging deadlines. Chief Technology Officer of Lab0, a stealth startup operating in the logistics and supply chain industry. Extensive background in kinematics, optimization, robot control, decision making, planning under uncertainty, calibration, tactile sensing, machine learning, 2D and 2D computer vision, IMU processing. Mastery of C++, with a deep knowledge of the ROS and YARP middlewares. Daily experience with the iCub humanoid and the Baxter collaborative robot. Strong presentation/communication skills thanks to experience in giving both technical and non-technical talks to both small and big groups, tailoring to the audience. Presented to major international robotics conferences, as well as several outreach events, ranging from exhibitions and fairs, to live TV shows and various interviews. Proven track record in writing technical reports as well as scientific papers. Authored and co-authored numerous international peer-reviewed scientific articles and journals. Extensive experience with research grant writing and awarding. Summary Alessandro Roncone received his B.Sc. summa cum laude in Biomedical Engineering in February 2008, and his M.Sc. summa cum laude in NeuroEngineering in July 2011 from the Università degli Studi di Genova, Italy. In April 2015 he completed his Ph.D. in Robotics, Cognition and Interaction Technologies from Università degli studi di Genova and Italian Institute of Technology (IIT), working in the Robotics, Brain and Cognitive Sciences and the iCub Facility departments under the supervision of prof. Giorgio Metta. The goal of his Ph.D. project was to exploit insights from the neurosciences in order to improve the sensorimotor capabilities of the iCub humanoid robot. From 2015 to 2018, he worked as a Postdoctoral Associate at the Social Robotics Lab in Yale University under the supervision of prof. Brian Scassellati (a.k.a. Scaz), where he focused on human robot collaboration and advanced manufacturing. In Fall 2018, he became faculty in the Computer Science Department of University of Colorado Boulder, where he directs the Human Interaction and RObotics [HIRO] Group. Professional Experience Jan. 2022 - present Portland, OR USA and Genoa, Italy Chief Technology Officer Lab0, https://www.lab0.com Lab0 is a stealth startup operating in the logistics and supply chain industry. We are fast growing and hiring at all levels---please reach out if you are interested! Our motto: Industrial autonomy at global scale. Aug. 2018 - present University of Colorado, Boulder, CO USA Assistant Professor Computer Science Department, University of Colorado Boulder At CU Boulder, I lead the Human Interaction and RObotics Group [HIRO], where we perform state-of-the-art research in the field. We work at the intersection of robotics, artificial intelligence and control to develop intuitive, human-centered technologies for the next generation of robot workers, assistants and collaborators. Nov. 2015 - Jul. 2018 Yale University, New Haven, CT USA Post-Doc @ Yale University Social Robotics Lab, Computer Science Department, Yale University My research at Yale University focused on task and motion planning for human-robot collaboration. I worked on systems that: i) provide effective support to the human when she needs it the most; ii) learn complex hierarchical representations from single instructions; iii) proactively ask questions and provide contextual information to query and share internal states and intents. Jan. - Oct. 2015 Italian Institute of Technology (IIT), Genova IT Post-Doc @ iCub Facility I worked on implementing a model of peripersonal space on the iCub robot, focusing on: i) rich body representations, and ii) distributed motor control via whole-body awareness. I also worked on optimization-based approaches to inverse kinematics and robot control: my gaze stabilization and control framework formally solved the problem of controlling a binocular head to gaze toward an arbitrary 3D point in space, and concurrently exploiting redundancy to stabilize gaze. Nov. 2011 - Dec. 2014 Italian Institute of Technology (IIT), Genova IT Ph.D. Fellow @ iCub Facility Life and Humanoid Technologies Doctoral course in Robotics, Cognition and Interaction Technologies. See the `Education` section below for details about my Ph.D. project. I have been involved in the Xperience FP7-ICT-270273 and WYSIWYD FP7-ICT-61239 projects, funded by the European Union Seventh Framework Program with a funding of €7,634,000 and €4,583,016 respectively. Oct. 2010 - Jul. 2011 Italian Institute of Technology (IIT), Genova IT Research Fellow @ RBCS (Robotics, Brain and Cognitive Science) I have worked at the Italian Institute of Technology during my MSc thesis.
