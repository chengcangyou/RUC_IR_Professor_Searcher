I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2018 from Rutgers University-New Brunswick. I was a visiting scholar at National University of Singapore (2013 - 2014) and at Duke University (Summer 2018).NewsFeb. 2024: Grace arrived!!!Feb. 2023: Received NSF CAREER award.Jan. 2021: Chloe arrived!!!Research (publications, google scholar, dblp)My research interests lie in both the theoretical aspects and applications of machine learning. I am particularly interested in the following problems and their interplay:learning in the presence of noise, e.g. label noise, malicious data;learning with unsupervised learning, e.g. contrastive learning, pre-training;data-efficient learning, e.g. high-dimensional statistics, meta/transfer learning;label-efficient learning, e.g. active learning, learning with enriched queries.GrantsNSF-AF-2239376 (CAREER),  NSF-RI-1948133 (CRII)Academic ServicesArea Chair: ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR (2024 - present), AISTATS (2025 - present), ACML (2022 - present)Action Editor/Associate Editor: TMLR, Visual Intelligence (2024 - present)Reviewer: FOCS, COLT, ICML, NeurIPS/NIPS, AISTATS, ICLR, JMLR, ML, TIT, TSP, SPNSF Panel: 2023 - present(Chloe's 100th day)Google SitesReport abuseGoogle SitesReport abuse",
