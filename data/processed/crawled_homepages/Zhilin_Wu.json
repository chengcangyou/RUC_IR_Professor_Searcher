Around this goal, my research topics cover the following aspects: -- Investigation of the theoretical properties (expressibility, decidability, complexity) of automata models and logic specifications, -- Efficient algorithms for the decision problems (nonemptiness, reachability, satisfiability, entailment) of the automata models and logic specifications, -- Methodology for the automated formal analysis and verification of computer programs, -- Tool implementation and case studies Claim: Template adapted from \"A Subtle Green\" developed by Bryant Smith",
