I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&M University. Before joining TAMU, I spent two wonderful years as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, working with Fernando De la Torre. I did my Ph.D. in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University with Harry Chao and Dong Xuan. I received my M.S. and B.Eng. degrees from BUPT and Tianjin University, respectively. I have spent time interning at NVIDIA AV, Volvo Cars, FXPAL, and Alibaba. For more information, please see a copy of my CV. My research interests are machine learning and its applications to computer vision, multimodal understanding, human modeling for extended reality, and cyber-physical systems. More updates are coming soon. If you are interested in joining our group, please read this.
