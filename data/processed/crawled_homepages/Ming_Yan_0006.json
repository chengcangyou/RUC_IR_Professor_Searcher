He then spent another seven years at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) — including a one-year postdoctoral period at Rice University — and obtained his Ph.D. in Mathematics in 2012.From 2015 to 2022, Ming Yan spent seven years at Michigan State University (MSU), where he was a faculty member in both the Department of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering (CMSE) and the Department of Mathematics.He joined CUHK-Shenzhen in 2022.Research OverviewMing Yan’s research lies at the intersection of optimization theory, machine learning, and scientific computing, where mathematics meets modern data-driven discovery. His work focuses on developing algorithms that are both theoretically grounded and computationally efficient, with applications to large-scale and structure-rich problems arising in science and engineering.See more about his research topics and recent publications.OpportunitiesHe is recruiting highly motivated PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and visiting students to join his research group. Preferred backgrounds include mathematics, computer science, or related areas, with strong analytical thinking and solid programming skills.Those interested in topics such as optimization, machine learning, or AI-driven scientific computing are encouraged to visit the Join Us page for application instructions.AcknowledgmentsHis research is supported by theChina: National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province, and Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission.U.S.: National Science Foundation (NSF), Ford Motor Company, and Meta (formerly Facebook)Last updated: October 2025",
