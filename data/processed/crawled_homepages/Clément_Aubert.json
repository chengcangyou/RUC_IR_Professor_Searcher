Aux visiteurs francophones J’ai un site plus complet et plus orienté recherche à aubert.perso.math.cnrs.fr. La plupart des documents y sont en Anglais et en Français, d’ailleurs. Presentation I am an associate professor (with tenure) in Computer Science at the School of Computer and Cyber Sciences, at Augusta University, in Georgia, USA. I am also a member of the Graduate School and the faculty advisor of the ΔΛΔ. Prior to that, I have been a post-doctoral researcher at the Appalachian State University (Boone, NC, USA), at the LACL (Créteil, Val-de-Marne, France), at the I2M (Marseille, Bouches-du-Rhône, France), and a PhD student at the LIPN (Villetaneuse, Île-de-France, France). Please refer to my resume or my bios for a more complete presentation, and find below information about my teaching, my research, internships and projects, as well as miscellaneous factoids and how to contact me. Teaching Currently (Fall 2025) This semester, I am responsible for CSCI 3400 - Data Structures CSCI 8940 - Dissertation Research (two sections) the Provost Learning Community -- Making the Invisible Visible The ΔΛΔ Programming Languages Reading Group activities will take place on Fridays as usual. Students can have a look at my \"Quick Reflection on Course Evaluations\", which includes my previous evaluations, to be better prepared for the classes I teach and know what to expect. Notes CSCI 1301 - Principles of Computer Programming I, which is a mirror of the version hosted on github, and has been superseded by princomp.github.io. CSCI 3410 - Database Systems Lecture Notes (Draft) Study Guide - A Definitive Guide A Very Short Introduction To C A Very Short Introduction To Java A Quick Reflection on Course Evaluations Previously At Augusta University Graduate Classes CSCI 8970 - Research Exposure: Fall 2023 CSCI 8940 - Dissertation Research: Spring 2022, Summer 2022, Fall 2022, Spring 2023, Summer 2023, Fall 2023, Spring 2024, Summer 2024 CSCI 8720 - Problems in Computer and Cyber Sciences: Fall 2021 CSCI 8510 - Independent Study: Summer 2024 STAT 7880 - Special Topics: Spring 2021 CSCI 6910 - Master's Thesis Research: Spring 2021, Spring 2022 CSCI 6800 - Compiler Writing: Fall 2021 Undergraduate Classes CSCI 4990 - Undergraduate Research: Fall 2022, Spring 2024 CURS 2990 - Undergraduate Research: Summer 2023, Summer 2024 CURS 4990 - Undergrad Research III: Summer 2020, Summer 2022 CSCI 4800 - Compiler Writing: Fall 2021 CSCI 3410 - Database Systems: Fall 2017, Spring 2018, Spring 2019, Fall 2019, Spring 2020, Fall 2020, Spring 2021, Fall 2021 CSCI 1301 - Principles of Computer Programming I: Spring 2018, Fall 2018, Spring 2019, Fall 2019, Fall 2020, Spring 2022, Fall 2022 (labs only), Spring 2023 (labs only), Fall 2023, Spring 2024 CSCI 1302 - Principles of Computer Programming II: Fall 2024, Spring 2025 CSCI 3271 - Operating System I: Fall 2017, Fall 2018 Before Coming to Augusta University Fall 2016 - CS 1440 - Computer Science I, at Appstate Between 2010 and 2015, I taught various courses in France: please refer to a presentation of my teaching activities or my (French) webpage for more information. Research I work in the vast field of computational logic, which uses mathematical reasoning to discover and explain the mechanisms of computation. You might want to have a look at (in decreasing order of preference) an open directory of my publications at dissemin, self-archived research works at HAL and arXiv, my publication list, also hosted at dblp, or at the NIH's Library, my reviewer profile at MathSciNet or at zbMATH, my orcid.org profile, my Mastodon Academy profile, my Semantics Scholar profile, my google scholar profile, my ResearchGate profile (but, please, do not use it, and refer to this post as to why you should refrain from using it), my Pure profile. If I were to use keywords, it would probably be Using 2020 Mathematics Subject Classification 03D15 Complexity of computation (including implicit computational complexity) 03F52 Proof-theoretic aspects of linear logic and other substructural logics 68N18 Functional programming and lambda calculus 68Q85 Models and methods for concurrent and distributed computing (process algebras, bisimulation, transition nets, etc.) 18C50 Categorical semantics of formal languages Using the 2012 ACM Computing Classification System Computing methodologies → Concurrent computing methodologies → Concurrent programming languages Theory of computation Logic Linear logic Proof theory Type theory Semantics and reasoning Program semantics Program reasoning → Program analysis Models of computation Concurrency → Process calculi Computability Abstract machines Models of computation Formal languages and automata theory → Formalisms → Rewrite systems Hardware → Emerging technologies → Reversible logic Publications @mastersthesis{aubert2009, title = {L'élimination des coupures dans la Logique des Domaines Constants}, author = {Aubert, Clément}, year = 2009, url = {https://aubert.perso.math.cnrs.fr/recherche/memoire_m1_c_aubert.pdf}, note = {sous la dir. de J.-B.
