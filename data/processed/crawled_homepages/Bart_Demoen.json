After my retirement, I was deeply involved in in-service teacher training and the \"Vlaamse Programmeerwedstrijd\", on behalf of the KU Leuven (as an \"emeritus met opdracht\"), but that ended abruptly some months ago, when the administration informed me that I am too old for continuing that ... I have to warn you: officially, the KU Leuven does not endorse anything I do from now on. Take that into account when you talk to me :-) You can talk to me by email: bartdemoen at gmail . com.",
