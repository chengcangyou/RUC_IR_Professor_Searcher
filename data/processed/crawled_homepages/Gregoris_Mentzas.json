His main research focus is on AI-enabled decision support: augmenting human intelligence with data-driven approaches and using Artificial Intelligence to elevate human decision-making competence. His current research concerns: the development of prescriptive data analytics for digital assistants in industry 4.0, the integration of human feedback in reinforcement learning and the use of big data analytics in applications like personalised health, smart mobility, technology acceptance and sustainable living. Prof. Mentzas has published 4 books and more than 350 papers in international peer-reviewed journals and conferences, has 5 best papers awards. He sits on the editorial board of five international journals and has served as (co-)Chair or Program Committee Member in more than 55 international conferences. He has led or contributed in more than 50 European research and development projects conducted in collaboration with leading technology firms like SAP, IBM, HP, Siemens, Software AG and ATOS. Prof. Mentzas is in the top 2% of highly cited scientists globally in a publicly available list of more than 7 million scientists in all areas of research and technology (22 scientific fields and 176 sub-fields). The list, which was published in 2021 in the journal PLOS Biology, retrieved data from the SCOPUS database and used a range of parameters for each scientist’s research contribution and influence, analyzed data of 7 million scientists with at least five published articles on the SCOPUS database. As a result, a list of the top 2% scientists from all scientific subjects was compiled. The classification takes into account standardized information on citations like the h-index, co-authorship adjusted hm-index, Research carried out by his group has led to the establishment of three internet technology companies. His experience includes twelve years of management consulting in corporate strategy and information systems strategy. He holds a Diploma Degree in Engineering (1984) and a Ph.D. in Operations Research and Information Systems (1988) both from NTUA. During 1996-1997 he held a Visiting Fellowship of the Royal Society within the Εuropean Science Exchange Programme on the topic “Information Management Systems” to Oxford University (Templeton College) and University of Cambridge (Judge Institute of Management Studies). During 2006-2009 he served as member of the Board of Directors of the Institute of Communication and Computer Systems, while in the 2010-2019 period he was Director of the division of “Industrial Electric Devices and Decision Systems” at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, NTUA.
