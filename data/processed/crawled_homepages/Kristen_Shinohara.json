My research focuses on the design of technologies usable by people with disabilities, making design practices accessible, supporting students with disabilities in graduate school, and teaching accessibility in computing. I have NSF funded projects investigating accessibility issues and experiences for graduate students with disabilities, and facilitating teaching modules to infuse accessibility into computing courses. I received my PhD from the University of Washington Information School in 2017, where I was advised by Jacob O. Wobbrock and co-advised by Wanda Pratt. I developed the Design for Social Accessibility (DSA) perspective, which includes consideration for social situations experienced by people with disabilities. The DSA perspective frames tenets for design and inlcudes a set of method cards to help designers engage in a design process sensitive to disabled user needs and preferences. Special thanks to Stephen Cady and Nayeri Jacobo for their help in preparing these tools for designers to download and use for free: Download DSA Method Cards Here Design Accessible Design Work in these projects focus on the accessibility of different aspects of the design thinking process (including approaches such as user-centered design), toward learning what can be done to improve accessibility of design tools and techniques.Supported by the Google Scholar Award Teach Teaching Accessibility in Computing We infuse accessibility into computing courses, focusing on: increasing student awareness and learning of accessibility topics and skills, and ensuring teaching materials and content are readily usable by instructors. Supported by NSF #2121549 Empower Empower Disabled Graduate Students in STEM We investigate how graduate students with disabilities manage inaccessibility in research. This work focuses on graduate students in STEM fields pursuing their doctoral degrees. Supported by NSF #1926209; RIT Grant Writer's Bootcamp Recent Papers Tlamelo Makati, Garreth W.
