My research interest lies in the areas of computer architecture and security, with a focus on side channel attacks and defenses. My group works on exploiting new micro-architectural vulnerabilities and designing comprehensive and efficient defense mechanisms. Before joining MIT, I earned a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I worked with Professor Josep Torrellas. I received a B.S. degree in Computer Science from Zhejiang University, China. I'm looking for highly-motivated PhD, MEng, and UROP students. If you are interested in working together, please read below. PhD: If you are a current MIT student, feel free to email me to schedule a meeting. For others, I would like to suggest following the normal PhD application process and indicate me as a preferred reader when submitting your application. MEng and UROP: If you are a current MIT student, I would recommend taking 6.5950/6.5951 Secure Hardware Design (was 6.888, 6.S983) or 6.5900 Computer System Architecture (was 6.823). I usually take on students from these courses. If you could not take these courses, I would suggest filling in this form to help me understand your background. For students interested in summer internship positions, please send me an email with your CV and a statement to describe your past project highlights. News 11/2023: We launched the official course website for 6.595 Secure Hardware Design: https://shd.mit.edu. Check out the team and all the exciting materials that we developped in the past three years. 10/2023: Will presented EntryBleed at HASP and won the Best Paper Award. 10/2023: We decided that our group name will be MATCHA: microarchitecture attacks and challenges. 09/2023: SecureLoop is accepted at MICRO'23. EntryBleed is accepted at HASP'23. Congratulations to Kyungmi and Will. 06/2023: I am co-organizing two workshops at ISCA'23 (FCRC). Feel free to check them out. PLARCH (Programming Languages for Architecture) is a workshop that brings together researchers working on overlaping topics between PLDI and ISCA. MAD (Microarchitectural Attacks and Defenses) Tutorial brings together researchers from industry and academia that want to learn about the state-of-the-art in both microarchitectural attack and defense research. 05/2023: My group received the Google Research Scholar Award. Peter and Vincent led the proposal. 03/2023: Two papers, Pensieve and Metior, are accepted at ISCA 2023. Congratulations to Yuheng and Peter. 01/2023: Two papers, PACMAN and Bigger Fish, are selected as Micro Top Picks from the Computer Architecture Conferences. >> older news... 11/2022: CaSA is selected as an honorable mention in the Top Picks in Hardware and Embedded Security. 09/2022: I received the Intel Rising Star Faculty Award, which recognizes research efforts of leading early-career professionals.
