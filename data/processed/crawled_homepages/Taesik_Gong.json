CV Email LinkedIn X Google Scholar I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) and Artificial Intelligence Graduate School (AIGS) at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), where I lead the Ubiquitous AI (UAI) Lab. Previously, I was a Research Scientist at Nokia Bell Labs and also a Visiting Scholar at the University of Cambridge. I earned my Ph.D. and M.S. from School of Computing at KAIST, under the supervision of Prof. Sung-Ju Lee, with close collaboration with Prof. Jinwoo Shin. I am a recipient of the Google Ph.D. Fellowship in Machine Learning. My Ph.D. dissertation received the Best Ph.D. Dissertation Award from both the School of Computing and the College of Engineering at KAIST. During my Ph.D., I did research internships at Google Research/Google AI (2022), Microsoft Research (2019), and Nokia Bell Labs (2018). I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Yonsei University with Summa Cum Laude.
