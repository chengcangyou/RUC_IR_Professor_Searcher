I am particularly interested in tools and languages that eliminate software errors, especially when this occurs at compile time. I have recently developed a new state-of-the-art programming language called Whiley, which performs compile-time checking of constraints. Please visit the Whiley web site for more information on this programming language. Biography I studied at Imperial College in London, where I obtained my undergraduate degree and PhD.
