Home Members Professor Members Professor Member Alumni Professor Mina Rho is interested in developing and applying computational methods to understand biological systems. Her current research focuses on developing computational methods for analyzing large-scale omics data, such as genomic, metagenomic, and transcriptomic information, to understand the relationship between genomic changes and human health and disease. Her goal is to build computational frameworks that can be applied for predicting disease status and biomarkers for prevention and therapeutics. She received her Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Indiana University Bloomington in 2009. Prior to joining Hanyang University in 2013, she was an Assistant Professor at Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY, USA. 개인정보보호정책 CONTACT US 관련사이트1 관련사이트2 서울특별시 성동구 왕십리로 222 TEL.02-2220-2379 E-MAIL.minarho@hanyang.ac.kr COPYRIGHT (C)2017 한양대학교 DATA MINING/BIOINFO LAB..
