Before joining UGA, I was a post-doctoral researcher at Penn State. My research interests cover a wide range of systems security and software security. I am especially interested in leveraging COTS hardware components/features to design and build systems that are more reliable and secure than solutions based on software alone. Currently, I am actively involved in research focused on advancing the state of the art in firmware analysis. I am grateful for receiving support from the NSF CAREER Award for this project. Opening: I am looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students. Please send me your CV if interested. Candidates are expected to have a solid background in system programming and operating systems.
