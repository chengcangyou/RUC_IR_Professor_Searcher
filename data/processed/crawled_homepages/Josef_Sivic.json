Â For latest updates please visit my webpage in Prague. I am senior researcher (roughly equivalent to associate professor with tenure) at INRIA working in the Willow project at the Department of Computer Science at Ecole Normale SupÃ©rieure . I also lead the Intelligent Machine Perception project at the Institute of Informatics, Robotics and Cybernetics at the Czech Technical University in Prague. I completed my PhD at the University of Oxford working with Professor Andrew Zisserman and received my habilitation degree at Ecole Normale SupÃ©rieure in Paris. Before coming to France I spent six months as a post-doc in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) at MIT working with Prof. William Freeman. My research is in computer vision - a branch of computer science and engineering that aims to extract information from images. I am particularly interested in developing learnable image representations for automatic visual recognition and scene understanding. I lead the ERC project LEAP .
