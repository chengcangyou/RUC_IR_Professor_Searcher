He has designed haptic and multimodal interfaces to support individuals who are blind and older adults to overcome the barriers faced when accessing graphical user interfaces. A series of empirical studies have been undertaken to identify the day-to-day accessibility issues encountered by disabled communities and those users who are situationally-impaired (SIID). Kuber has also examined ways to develop tactile feedback to augment the mobile interaction experience and to heighten levels of situational awareness using tactile feedback. Other areas of interest include tactile, auditory and graphical authentication to support communication. He received his Ph.D. from Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland, and M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees from University College London, UK.
