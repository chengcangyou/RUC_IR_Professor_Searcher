My research interests include most aspects of system security and in particular the areas of binary and malware analysis, reverse engineering, computer forensics, and web security. I am a recipient of an ERC Consolidator Grant that focuses on the analysis of compromised systems (more info). I am maintaining the Security Circus, a set of statistics (updated once a year) on the publications on the top four system security conferences. I am a member of the Order of the Overflow - the team who organized the DefCon Capture the Flag competition between 2018 and 2021. Before that, I was one of the founding members of the Shellphish hacking group, with whom I participated to ten DEFCON CTF finals (winning in 2005). When I am not in front of my computer, I like to climb rocks, surf waves, hike trails, and take pictures along the way. For more information about current funded projects and conference PC memberships please see here .
