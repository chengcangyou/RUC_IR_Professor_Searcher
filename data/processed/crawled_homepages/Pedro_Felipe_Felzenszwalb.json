I have worked on a range of different problems within computer vision, including the âlow-levelâ problem of image restoration, the \"mid-level\" problem of image segmentation, and the âhigh-levelâ problem of object recognition. My research involves connections between computer vision and artificial intelligence to a variety of areas including optimization, statistics, and natural language processing.
