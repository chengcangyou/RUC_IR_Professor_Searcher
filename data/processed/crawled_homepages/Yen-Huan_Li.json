I design and analyze machine learning and optimization algorithms. I am particularly interested in decision making under uncertainty, with weak or no assumptions about Reality. My research fields include machine learning, convex optimization, mathematical statistics, and quantum information theory. I am looking for students and research assistants interested in theoretical aspects of machine learning and optimization. If you want to work with me, please send me an email with your CV & transcripts, show me some theory papers in machine learning and/or optimization that interest you, and prepare a short presentation on the paper/papers. Curriculum VitæContact Information The most effective way to finding me is to send me an email!Blog: Que-sais je?
