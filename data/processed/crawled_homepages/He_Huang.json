Short Biography I am a Professor and Associate Dean of the School of Computer Science and Technology at Soochow University, P. R. China, where I also direct the Institutes of Network Science and Engineering. I received my Ph.D. from Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China. My advisor is Prof. Guoliang Chen. After graduating from USTC, I joined Soochow University as a lecturer in 2011, and was promoted to associate professor in 2013 and to professor in 2018. From 2019 to 2020, I was a visiting research scholar with Florida University, Gainesville, United States. I published 100+ peer-reviewed journal/conference papers and have 13 Chinese patents. I am a member of IEEE and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). My research interests include traffic measurement for high-speed Internet, Software Defined Networks, mobile computing, privacy and security, cyber-physical systems, and algorithms. I have been supported by China NSF, with the total support of more than 3.0 million CNY. My students and I won three best paper awards (Bigcom 2016, IEEE MSN 2018, IEEE Bigcom 2018). I am currently serving as an associate editor of 2 international journals, including Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems Journal, Frontiers in the Internet of Things. I served at various capacities (publicity chair, publication chair, and technical program committee) in a number of conferences, e.g., Publicity Co-Chair of ACM MobiHoc-MSCC 2016, Publication Chair of the Second IEEE INFOCOM Workshop on Networking Algorithms (WNA) in conjunction with IEEE INFOCOM 2022, TPC member of IEEE INFOCOM, IEEE MASS, IEEE ICC, and IEEE Globecom.",
