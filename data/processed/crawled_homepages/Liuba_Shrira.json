For example, how to provide high-performance reliable and available storage in adversarial environment, how to make long-lived consistent past states available to an application without performance penalty, how to upgrade without down-time a storage system as it evolves over time. I am helping organize SIGMOD 2022, OSDI 2022, EuroSys 2022, FAST 2023, SOSP 2023, EuroSys 2023, USENIX ATC'23. Please consider submitting!
