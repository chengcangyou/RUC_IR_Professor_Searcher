Previously, he served as Co-Executive Director (2016-2019) and then as Executive Director (2019-2024) of the Institute for Data Engineering and Science(IDEaS), a campuswide Interdisciplinary Research Institute (IRI). His academic home is the School of Computational Science and Engineering, where he served as Interim Chair from June 2019 to August 2020. He co-led the NSF South Big Data Regional Innovation Hub which nurtures big data partnerships among organizations in the sixteen Southern States (2015-present) and the NSF Transdisciplinary Research Institute for Advancing Data Science (2017-2024). Aluru conducts research in high-performance computing, data science, bioinformatics and systems biology, combinatorial scientific computing, and applied algorithms. He pioneered the development of parallel methods in computational biology and contributed to the assembly and analysis of complex plant genomes. His group is currently focused on developing bioinformatics methods for next-generation sequencing data analysis, construction of and alignments to genome graphs, and network methods to advance single-cell biology. His past contributions to scientific computing lie in parallel Fast Multipole Method, domain decomposition methods, spatial data structures, and applications in computational electromagnetics and materials informatics. Aluru is a recipient of the NSF CAREER award (1997), IBM faculty award (2002), Swarnajayanti Fellowship from the Government of India (2007), and the John. V. Atanasoff Discovery Award from Iowa State University (2017). At Georgia Tech, he received the Outstanding Senior Faculty Research and Leadership awards in the College of Computing, the Dean�s Award for faculty excellence, and the Outstanding Research Program Development Award at the institute level. He received the IEEE Computer Society Meritorious Service and Golden Core awards, and is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM). He is the 2025 recipient of the IEEE Computer Society Charles Babbage Award. Previously, Aluru held faculty positions at Iowa State University, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, New Mexico State University, and Syracuse University. Immediately prior to joining Georgia Tech, Aluru spent 14 years working as a faculty in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Iowa State University. At Iowa State, he held the Ross Martin Mehl and Marylyne Munas Mehl endowed professorship (2009-2013) and the Richard Stanley Chair in Interdisciplinary Engineering in the College of Engineering (2006-2009). He chaired the interdepartmental Bioinformatics and Computational Biology graduate program (2005-2007), served as associate chair for research in the department (2003-2006), and led the Dean's Research Initiative in high-throughput computational biology, a multi-disciplinary and multi-investigator initiative at the interface of high-performance computing and computational biology. He was a recipient of university-level awards for Outstanding Achievement in Research (2011) and Mid-career Achievement in Research (2006), Young Engineering Faculty Research Award (2002) within the College of Engineering, and the Warren B. Boast Undergraduate Teaching Award (2005).
