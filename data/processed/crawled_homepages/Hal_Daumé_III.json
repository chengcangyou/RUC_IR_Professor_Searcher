Standing in front of you is: A professor named Hal Daumé III (he/him). He wields appointments in Computer Science where he is a Volpi-Cupal Professor, as well as Language Science at UMD where he leads the TRAILS, the Institute for Trustworthy AI in Law & Society (in Fall 2025 he's teaching a grad seminar AI Agents (past: You and I, and Generative AI (S24), Trustworthy ML (F23), AI (S23), Human-AI Interaction (F22), Just ML (F21)); he was formerly also a Senior Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research NYC. He and his wonderful advisees like to study questions related to how to get machines to becomes more adept at human language (and artificial intelligence tasks more broadly), by developing models and algorithms that allow them to learn from data. (Keywords: natural language processing and machine learning.) The two major questions that really drive their research these days are: (1) how can we get computers to learn through natural interaction with people/users? and (2) how can we do this in a way that minimize harms in the learned models? He's discussed interactive learning informally in a Talking Machines Podcast and more technically in recent talks; and has discussed fairness/bias in broad terms in a (now somewhat outdated) blog post. He is the author of the online textbook A Course in Machine Learning, which is fully open source. Hal is super fortunate to be a member of, and have awesome colleagues in the Computional Linguistics and Information Processing Lab (which he formerly directed), the Human-Computer Interaction Lab, and the Center for Machine Learning. If you want to contact him, email is your best bet; you can also find him on @haldaume3 on Twitter. Or, in person, in his office (IRB 4134). If you're a prospective grad student or grad applicant, please read his FAQ to answer some common questions. If you're thinking of inviting him for a talk or event, please ensure that the event is organized in an inclusive manner (inclusion rider). More generally, if you are organizing a conference, workshop or other event, you may wish to read the NeurIPS D&I survey results (joint with Katherine Heller), Humberto Corona's collection of resources/advice, or two blog posts on this topic. I acknowledge that I live and work on the ancestral and unceded lands of the Piscataway People, who were among the first in the Western Hemisphere to encounter European colonists, as well as the lands of the Lenape and Nacotchtank people.

Sandoval, Christabel Acquaye, Kwesi Cobbina, Mohammad Nayeem Teli and Hal Daumé IIIConference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL), 2025[Abstract] [BibTeX] We examine the representation of African American English (AAE) in large language models (LLMs), exploring (a) the perceptions Black Americans have of how effective these technologies are at producing authentic AAE, and (b) in what contexts Black Americans find this desirable. Through both a survey of Black Americans ( 104) and annotation of LLM-produced AAE by Black Americans ( 228), we find that Black Americans favor choice and autonomy in determining when AAE is appropriate in LLM output. They tend to prefer that LLMs default to communicating in Mainstream U.S. English in formal settings, with greater interest in AAE production in less formal settings. When LLMs were appropriately prompted and provided in context examples, our participants found their outputs to have a level of AAE authenticity on par with transcripts of Black American speech.

This paper addresses these gaps through two interrelated studies. First, surveys identify differences in priorities and expectations between machine learning (ML) practitioners and Deaf American Sign Language (ASL) signers. Second, paired co-design sessions bring ML and ASL experts together to generate guiding questions that support practices for aligning AI development with community goals. Our findings reveal critical points of friction that reflect deeper systemic and epistemic barriers to effective collaboration. By synthesizing unique and shared insights from both groups, we provide empirically grounded resources to guide collaborative frameworks that promote the agency and expertise of the Deaf community. This research paves actionable pathways toward equitable, community-centered advancements in AI.@inproceedings{daume25collaboration, title = {Exploring Collaboration to Center the Deaf Community in Sign Language AI}, author = {Rie Kamikubo and Abraham Glasser and Alex X Lu and Daum\\'e, III, Hal and Hernisa Kacorri and Danielle Bragg}, booktitle = {ASSETS}, year = {2025}, url = {http://hal3.name/docs/#daume25collaboration},} Beyond Blanket Masking: Examining Granularity for Privacy Protection in Images Captured by Blind and Low Vision UsersJeffri Murrugarra-Llerena, Haoran Niu, Suzanne Barber, Hal Daumé III, Yang Trista Cao and Paola Cascante-BonillaCOLM, 2025[Abstract] [BibTeX] As visual assistant systems powered by visual language models (VLMs) become more prevalent, concerns over user privacy have grown, particularly for blind and low vision users who may unknowingly capture personal private information in their images. Existing privacy protection methods rely on coarse-grained segmentation, which uniformly masks entire private objects, often at the cost of usability. In this work, we propose FiGPriv, a fine-grained privacy protection framework that selectively masks only high-risk private information while preserving low-risk information. Our approach integrates fine-grained segmentation with a data-driven risk scoring mechanism. We evaluate our framework using the BIV-Priv-Seg dataset and show that FiG-Priv preserves +26% of image content, enhancing the ability of VLMs to provide useful responses by 11% and identify the image content by 45%, while ensuring privacy protection.
