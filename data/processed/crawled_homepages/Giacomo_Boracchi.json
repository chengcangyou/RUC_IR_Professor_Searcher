Ponzio, 34/5, 20133 Milano, Italy Tel: +39 02 2399 3467 E-mail: firstname.lastname@polimi.it Biosketch I am an Associate Professor of Computer Engineering at Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria of the Politecnico di Milano (DEIB). At DEIB I have also received the Ph.D. in information technology (2008), and before I graduated in Mathematics at Universitá Statale di Milano (2004). My research interests concern image processing and machine learning, and in particular image restoration and analysis, change/anomaly detection, domain adaptation, learning in nonstationary environments. Since 2016 I have been teaching PhD courses concerning image processing and classification in Politecnico di Milano and Tampere University (Finland). I also gave a few tutorials in major conferences (IEEE ICASSP and IEEE IJCNN). I am currently leading a few industrial research projects related to image understanding and anomaly detection together with STMicroelectronics, Gilardoni Raggi X and Cisco, which have lead to impactful industrial outcomes. I published more than 70 papers in international conferences and journals and I am currently Associate Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Image Processing since 2018. In 2015 I have received the IBM Faculty Award, in 2016 the IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems Outstanding Paper Award, in 2017 the Nokia Visiting Professor Scholarship and in 2021 an nVidia Applied Reseach Grant.
