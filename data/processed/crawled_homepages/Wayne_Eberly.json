Teaching has included topics in the design and analysis of algorithms and in theoretical computer science. As for the future? The pandemic brought opportunities along with challenges. We’ll see where things go. Service I have let it be known that I should update my business cards to add “addled old fart” to my list of duties. Many organizations have them. The argument can be made that they serve useful roles. I have decided to own it. It is possible that I also have an interesting sense of humour. Oh, yes, I have held a variety of service roles in support of undergraduate instruction, over the years. Support for “academic integrity” is a current focus. News June 2, 2025: Links to Fall, 2025 courses have been added. I hope to continue work on these but also to update the rest of my web site over the summer!
