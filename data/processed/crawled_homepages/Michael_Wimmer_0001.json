Short Bio Michael Wimmer is currently a full professor at the Institute of Visual Computing and Human-Centered Technology at TU Wien, where he heads the Rendering and Modeling Group. He is also the director of the Center for Geometry and Computational Design (GCD). His academic career started with his M.Sc. in 1997 at TU Wien, where he obtained his Ph.D. in 2001.His research interests are real-time rendering, computer games, real-time visualization of urban environments, point-based rendering, reconstruction of urban models, procedural modeling, shape modeling and computational design.He has coauthored over 200 papers in these fields. He also coauthored the book Real-Time Shadows. He regularly serves on program committees of the important conferences in the field, including ACM SIGGRAPH and SIGGRAPH Asia, Eurographics, IEEE VR, Eurographics Symposium on Rendering, ACM I3D, SGP, SMI, HPG, etc. He is currently associate editor of Computers & Graphics, and previously for ACM Transactions on Graphics, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, and Computer Graphics Forum. He was papers co-chair of EGSR 2008, Pacific Graphics 2012, Eurographics 2015, Eurographics GCH 2018, VMV 2019, EG 2021 short papers, Technical Papers Assistant Chair of ACM SIGGRAPH 2023, and Technical Papers Chair of SIGGRAPH Asia 2025. He was elected Fellow of the Eurographics Association in 2018, and won the Eurographics Outstanding Technical Contributions Award in 2023. He serves as Editor in Chief of Computer Graphics Forum since 2024.
