Previously I obtained my B.Sc from the Department of Mathematics Science, Tsinghua University. After that, I spent one year at the Department of System and Information Engineering (Engineering Systems and Environment), University of Virginia.My name is pronounced as DAWN-raw JOH.Research InterestsMy research interests are about foundation of machine learning. Specifically, I am interested inFoundation of sequential decision-making problems, including bandits and reinforcement learning (RL),Nearly optimal statistical complexity for RL with function approximation [COLT21] [NeurIPS22] [ICML23] [COLT23] [ICLR25], Provable contextual bandits with neural networks [ICML20] [ICLR21] [NeurIPS21],Foundation of optimization algorithms for deep learning,Nearly optimal sample complexity for stochastic gradient descent-based algorithms [NeurIPS18] [ICML19],Provable stochastic optimization algorithms escaping from saddle points [JMLR21] [ALT22].Recently, I have also been interested in decision-making algorithms for problems with complex structures (e.g., RL for large language model, hierarchal RL) from both algorithmic and systemic aspects. Education(2018 - 2023) University of California, Los Angeles,Ph.D. in Computer Science.(2017 - 2018) University of Virginia,Ph.D. student in System and Information Engineering.(2013 - 2017) Tsinghua University,Bachelor of Science in Pure and applied Mathematics.Publication(* indicates equal contribution, ** indicates alphabetic author order, underline denotes students under my supervision)Conference PublicationsFederated In-Context Learning: Iterative Refinement for Improved Answer Quality, Ruhan Wang*, Zhiyong Wang*, Chengkai Huang*, Rui Wang, Tong Yu, Lina Yao, John C.S.
