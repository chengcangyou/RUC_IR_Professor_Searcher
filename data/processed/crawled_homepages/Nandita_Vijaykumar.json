I am currently a Research Scholar at Amazon. I am a faculty member at the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence. I am also a faculty member at the Acceleration Consortium and am affiliated with the Robotics Institute. I lead the embARC Research Group. I received my Ph.D. and M.S. in 2020 from Carnegie Mellon University where I was advised by Prof. Onur Mutlu and Prof. Phil Gibbons. I was fortunate to also work with the Systems Group in the Computer Science Department at ETH Zurich as a visiting student. In the past, I have also worked for AMD, Intel, Microsoft, and Nvidia. My group's research explores the intersection of computer systems/architecture with visual computing, including computer vision, robotics, and machine learning. I am particularly interested in building efficient, scalable, and programmable systems that enable machines to perceive, interpret, and interact with the physical world. Our work focuses on cross-stack co-designâspanning algorithms, compilers, runtimes, and hardwareâfor workloads such as 3D reconstruction, neural rendering, spatial perception, and generative models. Our research has been supported by industry and academic partners including Intel, AMD, LG, Sony, Rebellions AI, NSERC, MITACS, CentML, and CSE Canada. You can read more about my group's research here. I am currently looking to take new graduate students. Please apply directly to the graduate program at the Department of Computer Science. For undergraduate students interested in doing research with my group, please send me an email with your CV and transcripts. My group also has post-doctoral researcher positions available. If you are interested in the above topics, please send me an email.
