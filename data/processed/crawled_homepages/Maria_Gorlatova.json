Barton Associate Professor of Electrical & Computer Engineering Maria Gorlatova, Ph.D. Profile Photo Research Themes Trustworthy Computing Research Interests Architectures, algorithms, and protocols for emerging mobile pervasive systems and the Internet of Things. Our work crosses traditional discipline boundaries and requires thinking across multiple layers of system and protocol stacks. We are focusing on breaking the barriers for technologies that enable fundamentally new deployments and experiences, such as energy harvesting, artificial intelligence adapted to the Internet of Things constraints, and augmented reality. Bio Dr. Maria Gorlatova's research is at the intersection of sensor, mobile, and pervasive computer systems and communications and networking. She creates human-facing pervasive computing platforms that enable transformative applications and support users in leading healthy and productive lives and in reaching personal and professional goals. The focus of her recent work is on advanced augmented reality (AR) platforms that integrate edge computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) to enable contextual, responsive, and scalable AR experiences. She conduct research in edge AI, collaborative and infrastructure-assisted spatial and semantic awareness for AR, AR user cognitive context sensing, and AR QoS and QoE evaluation. rnDr. Gorlatova earned her Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University, and her M.Sc. and B.Sc. (Summa Cum Laude) degrees in Electrical Engineering from University of Ottawa, Canada. She has several years of industry experience, where she had been affiliated with Telcordia Technologies, IBM, and D. E. Shaw Research. She came to Duke from Princeton University, where she held the positions of an Associate Research Scholar in the Electrical Engineering Department and an Associate Director of the Princeton EDGE Lab. Dr. Gorlatova received multiple awards including the 2025 DARPA Director’s Fellowship Award, 2023 DARPA Young Faculty Award, 2021 NSF CAREER Award, 2021 Facebook Research Award, 2023 Cisco Research Award, 2020 and 2023 IBM Faculty Awards, 2016 IEEE Communications Society Young Author Best Paper Award, 2020 ACM/IEEE IPSN Best Research Artifact Award, and 2011 IEEE Communications Society Award for Advances in Communications. She also received the Google Anita Borg USA Fellowship, Columbia University Presidential Fellowship, and top national Alexander Graham Bell Canadian Graduate Scholar (CGS) NSERC M.Sc. and Ph.D. Fellowships. Dr. Gorlatova serves on technical program committees of multiple conferences including ACM SenSys, ACM/IEEE IPSN, IEEE INFOCOM, IEEE ICDCS, ACM SIGCOMM, and ACM MobiCom. She chaired the TPC of the Edge Computing track of IEEE ICDCS,  the TPC of ACM/IEEE IPSN, and the TPC of ACM/IEEE SenSys. Education B.S. University of Ottawa (Canada), 2004 M.S.
