My Ph.D dissertation was nominated for the distinguished Ph.D dissertation award of China Computer Federation. My PhD advisor is Prof. Hong Mei, and was co-advised by Prof. Lu Zhang and Prof. Tao Xie. After graduation, I joined Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences as an assistant professor, and was promoted as an associated professor in 2011. From 2012 to 2014, I was a visiting scholar with University of California, Davis, where I worked with Prof. Zhendong Su. In 2014, I joined Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am a recipient of ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award, the best paper award of ASE, and the best paper award of APSEC. Please submit your high-quality research papers to ICSE 2026, ASE 2025, and ICSME 2025.
