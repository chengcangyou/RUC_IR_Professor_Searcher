I’m also a Junior fellow of the Institut universitaire de France (2025-2030), as well as the co-founder and CTO of NetMicroscope. My research focuses broadly on leveraging emergent technologies to engineer software systems designed to measure and improve network service performance. Before joining ENS Lyon, I was a Research Scientist at Nokia Bell Labs as well as a Post-Doc at Inria, Paris. I obtained a Ph.D. from WINLAB at Rutgers University. Recent news Nov 20, 2025 We’ve launched NetML.io, a hub for our research applying machine learning to network performance, security, and traffic analysis—featuring our latest projects, publications, datasets, and course materials. Oct 31, 2025 I’m honored to be the recipient of the 2025 GDR RSD Junior Researcher Award! Sep 17, 2025 Our work arguing for a new Internet geolocation architecture has been accepted at ACM HotNets 2025. Congrats to my Ph.D. student Augustin for leading this work! Sep 13, 2025 Our work developing JITI, a model serving system to support fast and accurate network traffic inference pipelines, has been accepted at ACM CoNEXT 2025. Congrats to Chase for leading this work! Jul 18, 2025 We have received an International Emerging Actions (IEA) award from the CNRS to carry on our work on synthetic network traces generation!
