Our recent research interest is on Emotional Intelligence. Emotions play a major role in learning, behaviour, and memorization process. The center of emotions in the brain is the entry to memory and knowledge              retrieval. So, in focussing on this element of the brain we wish to develop ITS able to control and manage knowledge management and learning. The principle is to build ITS able to control our center of emotions and          strengthen human learning. Since 1988 our research interest is related to Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) a domain which regroups Artificial Intelligence, Education, Pedagogy, Learning techniques, Knowledge Engineering, e-learning, and Neural techniques. Our ultime goal is to understand how our brain functions and produces knowledge, how this knowledge is stored, retrieved and deployed. The ITS activity led to two important steps: the creation of the ITS International Conference (1988), held now every year in the world, the creation of the GRITI group, involving 7 universities in Quebec, grouped around the SAFARI project which produced about 70 graduate students and led to an international recognition in the field Author or co-author of about 380 refeered publications.
