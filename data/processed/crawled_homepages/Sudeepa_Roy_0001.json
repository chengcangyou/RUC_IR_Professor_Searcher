The Call For Papers can be found here. I am serving as the PC Chair of the 28th International Conference on Database Theory (ICDT) 2025, to be held in Barcelona, Spain in March 2025 as the EDBT/ICDT 2025 Joint Conference. In 2023-24, I spent a wonderful sabbatical in Berkeley, CA. I spent Fall'23 at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, University of California, Berkeley, where I co-organized (with Guy Van den Broeck, Hung Ngo, Dan Suciu, and Virginia Vassilevska Williams) a semester-long program titled Logic and Algorithms in Database Theory and AI. This program was attended by about 100 long-term and short-term participants. Please check out the webpage for the videos and slides of many tutorials and talks! I spent Spring'24 as a Visiting Scientist at RelationalAI, and also as a Visiting Scholar at UC Berkeley Sky Computing, hosted by Prof. Joe Hellerstein. I am honored to give an invited keynote at the EDBT/ICDT Joint Conference 2024 in Paestum, Italy on March 25, 2024 titled \"How Database Theory Helps Teach Relational Queries in Database Education\". Background I joined the Department of Computer Science at Duke University in Fall 2015. I am a member of the Duke Database Group (a.k.a. Duke Database Devils; more about Duke Blue Devils), which is part of the Duke Systems Group. Before joining Duke, I was a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington where I worked with Prof. Dan Suciu and the database group. I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a Ph.D. in Computer and Information Science where I was advised by Prof. Susan Davidson and Prof. Sanjeev Khanna. During my Ph.D., I did two internships at IBM Research, Almaden. Research My research area is broadly in Databases, Data Management, and Data Analysis in Computer Science. My recent research focuses on foundational aspects of big data processing and responsible data analysis along three thrusts: Data management: I work on repairing noisy data, data provenance, developing tools to help new programmers and students learn and debug relational queries, query optimization, data exploration, and other problems. Earlier, I worked on information extraction, workflow provenance, and crowd-sourcing. Data analysis: I work on interpretable and scalable causal inference techniques for complex observational data, meaningful explanations for different steps in the data analysis pipeline, and prescriptive data analytics. I also work on data science applications in different domains. Database theory: I work on various database theory problems at the intersection of databases, logic, and algorithms, including query evaluation and repair on databases annotated by semirings, evaluation of recursive datalog programs, circuits for data provenance, and query evaluation on probabilistic databases.
