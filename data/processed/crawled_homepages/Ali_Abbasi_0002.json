My research sits at the intersection of hardware and system security, focusing on hardware-assisted techniques to enhance the security of embedded and mission-critical systems. This includes employing side-channel analysis for system-level introspection and developing scalable approaches to vulnerability discovery, such as firmware fuzzing via rehosting and hardening under strict real-time constraints. The aim is to bridge hardware and software security to address complex attack surfaces in real-world environments, including space and automotive systems. Open PhD/Postdoc Positions: I have multiple open PhD and Postdoc positions in embedded systems security topics, including firmware defense/fuzzing and side-channel.
