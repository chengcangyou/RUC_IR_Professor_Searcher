It provides a mathematical framework for modeling decision making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker. MDPs are useful for studying optimization problems solved via dynamic programming. MDPs were known at least as early as the 1950s; a core body of research on Markov decision processes resulted from Ronald Howard's 1960 book, Dynamic Programming and Markov Processes. They are used in many disciplines, including robotics, automatic control, economics and manufacturing. The name of MDPs comes from the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov as they are an extension of Markov chains. Research interestsArtificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Digital Therapeutics(DTx) and Multimodal Analysis Emailhyoh79@gmail.comhyoh79@skku.eduReligiona Roman Catholic        Projects0) 2022.06~2025.02 연구재단 기본연구(A Study on Next-generation A.I.
