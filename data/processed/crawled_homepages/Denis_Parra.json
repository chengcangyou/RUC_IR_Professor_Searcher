I am also affiliated to three centers of research excellence in Chile: i-Health, CENIA, and IMFD. I am principal researcher at the Millenium Institute for Intelligent Healthcare Engineering (iHealth), as well as associate researcher at the National Center for Artificial Intelligence (CENIA). I am also adjunct researcher at the Millennium Institute for Research on Fundamentals of Data (IMFD). I hold a professional title of Civil Engineer in Informatics, class of 2004 from UACh, Valdivia, Chile; and a Ph.D. in Information Science from University of Pittsburgh, USA, where I was supervised by Professor Peter Brusilovsky. I earned a Fulbright scholarship to pursue my PhD studies between 2008-2013. My research interests are Recommender Systems, Intelligent User Interfaces, Applications of Machine Learning (Medical Imaging, Creative AI) and Information Visualization and I am currently leading the Human-centered AI and Visualization (HAIVis) research group as well as co-leading the CreativAI Lab with professor Rodrigo CÃ¡diz. I am also Faculty member of the PUC IA Lab. If you are interested on these topics and want to work under my supervision as Master or PhD student, send me an e-mail to denis.parra[at]uc[dot]cl.
