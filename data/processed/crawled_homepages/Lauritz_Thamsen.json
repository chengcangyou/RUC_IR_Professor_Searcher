Within the School, I am a member of the Glasgow Systems Section (GLASS), I contribute to the Low-Carbon and Sustainable Computing research theme, and I lead the Glasgow Carbon-Conscious Computing (GC3) lab.Beyond the School, I co-lead the collaboration on Adaptive Resource Management (ARM) with TU Berlin. In addition, I have previously coordinated a collaboration with researchers from TU Berlin and Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI) on Distributed Systems Engineering. Since joining Glasgow in 2022, I have won an EPSRC New Investigator Award to work on Carbon-Aware Scalable Processing in Elastic Clusters (with AWS, BBC, and HU Berlin) and the Early-Career Teaching Excellence Award of the College of Science and Engineering for several strategic teaching-focused initiatives and day-to-day teaching of a particularly high standard. In addition, I helped run LOCO 2024 (as PC Co-Chair) and Euro-Par 2022 (as Local Chair) in Glasgow. Before joining the University of Glasgow, I was a senior researcher in the Distributed and Operating Systems group at TU Berlin, lecturing on Cloud Computing and on Distributed Systems, and a guest professor in the Department of Computer Science at HU Berlin, substituting for Prof. Ulf Leser and lecturing on Data-Intensive Systems. The major research activities that I developed in these roles include the C5 individual project, subprojects in the research center BIFOLD, and subprojects in the interdisciplinary projects WaterGridSense and OPTIMA. In addition, I co-developed and co-led the ide3a teaching network and a subproject in the collaborative research center FONDA. At TU Berlin, I furthermore completed a postdoc and did my PhD under Prof. Odej Kao, working on dynamic resource allocation for distributed dataflow systems in the DFG research unit Stratosphere and the Berlin Big Data Center. Prior to that, I was part of the Software Architecture Group of Prof. Robert Hirschfeld, the Research School at HPI, and the HPI-Stanford Design Thinking Research Program. In addition, I have previously worked at SAP Labs in Palo Alto, California, within the Technology Infrastructure Practice group, under Dan Ingalls, and I have also worked at Signavio in Berlin. More about me and my research can be found at https://lauritzthamsen.org/. Research interests I am passionate about making computing more efficient, resilient, and sustainable. To this end, I work on methods and tools that make it easier to create resource-efficient and reliable distributed computer systems, focusing especially on adaptive resource management and carbon-aware computing for data-intensive applications running on edge/cloud infrastructure.
