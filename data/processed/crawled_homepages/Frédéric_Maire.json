Research interests shifted toward machine learning, computer vision and robotics  Note for current and prospective students:  for project topics (from 4th year to PhD),  visit   https://wiki.qut.edu.au/display/cyphy/Student+project+topics+proposed+by+Frederic+Maire ProjectsAutonomous UAV decision making under environment and target detection uncertaintyDetection and mapping of exotic weeds using UAS and machine learning: Bitou Bush Case StudyWeakly Supervised Segmentation of Underwater Imagery Additional information Experience My current research main focus is on an international project on \"Dugong Detector to Monitor Seagrass Health\"  https://amru.org.au/our-research/dugong-detector/ My early work on neural networks and AI for strategic games did not involve industry partners but in the last few years my projects have become more applied: Development of deep learning based software to monitor dugong populations. Robotic solution for textile recycling Smart bin I have been involved through the Rail CRC in the development of vision based techniques to detect near-miss incidents at railroad crossings. With colleagues from CARRS-Q, I have applied machine learning techniques to driver safety problems. I have also worked on projects for Mining3.
