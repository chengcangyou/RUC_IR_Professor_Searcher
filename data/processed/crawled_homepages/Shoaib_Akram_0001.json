He obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from Ghent University (Belgium) under the advisement of Lieven Eeckhout. He also holds an M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the USA. He received the Fulbright Scholarship from the U.S. government and a Marie Curie Fellowship from the EU Commission. His research interests include computer systems in general and computer architecture, hardware/software interface, and optimizing storage-intensive applications for modern data-centric hardware in particular. He leads the ANUâs Vertically Integrated Computer Systems (VICS) research group advising Ph.D. and undergraduate students. His work has been published in top-tier computer architecture, operating systems, programming languages, and performance analysis conferences, including PLDI, ASPLOS, PACT, ISPASS, and SIGMETRICS. He has been a program committee member of prominent conferences in his area, including ISCA, MICRO, HPCA, ASPLOS, and ISPASS. His work has received nominations for a Best Paper award at multiple conferences and won the Memorable Paper Award. Between 2020 and 2024, he introduced courses on advanced computer architecture at ANU and convened and significantly restructured the foundational computer systems curriculum. He currently teaches ANUâs introductory computer architecture course to the 400+ College of Computing and Engineering students and an advanced computer architecture course to selected students. He previously taught systems, networks, and concurrency to 250+ students and a special topics course on computer microarchitecture.
