I am Saeed Lotfifard an associate professor with the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and Energy Systems Innovation center (ESIC) at Washington State university. I received my Ph.D. degree from Texas A&M University in electrical engineering in 2011. My research interests include: Operational security of inverter-dominated power systems, focusing on stability, protection, and control challenges of massive grid integration of inverter-based resources. Analysis, modeling, and enhancement of fault response behavior of inverter-dominated power grids Application of mathematical optimization, control theory, machine learning and big data analytics for fault resilience reinforcement of smart grids with high share of renewable energy sources.
