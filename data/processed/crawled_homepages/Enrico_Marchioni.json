I obtained my PhD at the University of Salamanca (Spain), in 2006. Between 2007 and 2008, I worked as a lecturer at the Open University of Catalonia (Spain), and, from 2008 to 2011, I was a Juan de la Cierva postdoctoral research fellow at the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute of the Spanish National Research Council (IIIA-CSIC). In 2012, after a brief research assistantship at the Mathematics institute of the University of Bern (Switzerland) at the end of 2011, I returned as a researcher at IIIA-CSIC. From 2012 to 2014, I was a Marie Curie postdoctoral research fellow at the Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse, Paul Sabatier University, in France. From 2014 to 2017, I was a researcher in a EPSRC funded project at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Oxford.
