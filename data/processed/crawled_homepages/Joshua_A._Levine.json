I work with an awesome research group: Tanner Finken (PhD CS), Emiliano Islas (PhD CS), Md Afridi Hasan (MS CS), Jake Balla (MS CS), and Jackson Randolph (BS CS). I also co-mentor a fantastic postdoc, Zhimin Li, located at Vanderbilt University. Alumni of my group. I was a member of UAâs HDC Lab. Before joining UA, I used to profess at Clemson University. I am a postdoctoral alumnus of University of Utahâs Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute having worked with Valerio Pascucci and Ross T. Whitaker. I did my PhD at the Ohio State University with Tamal K. Dey and my undergraduate and MS at Case Western Reserve University with Michael S. Branicky. My short bio, google scholar, dblp, and cv. I research visualization and (less so these days) geometric modeling. Along the way, I use topological analysis, high-performance computing, and computer graphics. I write code for my research, including contributions to TTK, Cleaver, DelPSC, and DelIso.
