This information serves as a mirror of the real world, and within this vast amount of digital data lie valuable clues that make it possible to analyze and visualize social trends and forecast the future. Building on this concept, Professor Masashi Toyoda of the Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo is exploring methods to harness the ever-growing volume of data that accumulates daily in digital space. Toyoda has proposed methods using data from social media to estimate various figures, such as the number of positive COVID-19 cases that will arise and the degree of attendance at various types of events, as well as techniques for visualizing the results of data analyses. How are such estimates made possible? And how will visualizing these various forms of data contribute to society? We spoke with Toyoda to find out.
