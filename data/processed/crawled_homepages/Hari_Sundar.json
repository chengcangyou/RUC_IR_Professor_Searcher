He was previously an Associate Professor in the Kahlert School of Computing at the University of Utah. His research focuses on the development of computationally optimal parallel, high-performance algorithms, that are efficient and scalable on state-of-the-art architectures. It is driven by applications in biosciences, geophysics, computational fluid dynamics and computational relativity. His research has resulted in the development of state-of-the-art distributed algorithms for adaptive mesh refinement, geometric multigrid, fast Gauss transform and sorting. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania and was a postdoctoral scholar at the Oden Institute at the University of Texas at Austin.",
