Since then, he has also been a visiting researcher at the University of Waterloo, the MADALGO Center for Massive Data Algorithms,  the Max-Planck-Institut fur Informatik, INRIA-Sophia, AT&T Labs-Research, and DIMACS.  He served as the HKUST Associate Vice-President for Postgraduate Studies from 2011-2014. In addition, he was the 2008 recipient of the HKUST  Michael G. Gale Award for Distinguished Teaching. Research interests: The theory, design and application of algorithms; computational geometry; information theory; combinatorics.
