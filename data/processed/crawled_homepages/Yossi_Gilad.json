Research Interests. I design, build, and analyze secure and scalable protocols and networked systems. My work focuses on the mechanisms that comprise Internet services. It ranges from the core Internet protocols, through content delivery networks, to large-scale Internet applications. My research methodology combines rigorous analysis with experimental evaluation, as well as informing deployment via standardization and interactions with practitioners. Industry Experience. I was the CTO at Algorand, where we developed a breakthrough consensus protocol that scales to support any number of participants. Iâve also worked on large-scale production systems at Google and IBM where I held various R&D roles. Honors, Awards, Grants Israel Science Foundation individual research grant (2023-2027).

Meta-data private communication at scale Private communication over the Internet remains a challenging problem. Even if messages are encrypted, it is hard to deliver them without revealing metadata about which users are communicating. Scalable metadata-hiding systems, such as Tor, are popular but susceptible to traffic analysis attacks. In contrast, the largest-scale systems with metadata privacy require passing all messages through a small number of providers, incurring a very high operational cost for each provider and limiting their deployability in practice. Stadium (SOSP'17) is a point-to-point messaging system that provides metadata and data privacy while scaling its work efficiently across hundreds of low-cost providers operated by different organizations. We show that Stadium can scale to support 4x more users than the current state of the art, using servers that cost an order of magnitude less to operate. However, Stadium induces high latency, and to facilitate broad adoption, the metadata-private system should present comparable performance to ``vanilla'' (non-m",
