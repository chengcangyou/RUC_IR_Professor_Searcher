I received my Ph.D. in Information Science with a specialization in Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) from the School of Informatics and Computing at Indiana University-Bloomington (IUB). Prior to joining Clemson, I was an Assistant Professor in the School of Information Technology at the University of Cincinnati (UC). At UC, I directed the game development and simulation tracks for the Master of Science and Bachelor of Science programs in Information Technology. My research interests, broadly construed, focus on how interactive technologies, such as multiplayer online games, esports, live streaming, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and social virtual reality, shape interpersonal relationships and group behavior. My work brings a unique combination of profound theoretical foundation, nuanced empirical perspectives, especially in-depth qualitative insights, and participatory technology design and prototype to investigate mediated experience and social dynamics forged surrounding various technological and collaborative systems and artifacts, in order to design and develop more supportive and fulfilling user experiences with technology. I have authored over 120 peer-reviewed publications and won 15 Best Paper or Best Paper Honorable Mention Awards (top 3%-5%). My work has been supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), US Army, and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research. I am also a dedicated member of the ACM SIGCHI community. I have served numerous leading editorial and organizational roles in SIGCHI throughout my career. Some major leadership roles I have served include: ACM CSCW 2026 General Chair; ACM CHI 2025 and 2026 Games and Play Subcommittee Chair; ACM CHI 2026 Analytics co-Chair; ACM GROUP 2025 General Chair; ACM CHI PLAY 2024 General Chair; ACM CHI PLAY and ACM GROUP Steering Committee member; ACM CHI PLAY 2022 and 2023 Papers Chair; and the 2021 ACM International Conference on Interactive Media Experiences (IMX) Technical Program/Papers Chair. At Clemson, I lead the Gaming and Mediated Experience Lab (CUGAME). If you are a prospective student who is interested in joining our lab, please read our CUGAME Lab Handbook. This document should help you understand who we are and whether our lab is a good match for your personality, interests, and research approaches. By adopting a mixed-method approach including interviews, content analysis, surveys, and participatory technology design and prototype, our work has three interlinked research themes in HCI on social computing, games and play, and social VR: (1) How novel interactive technologies such as gaming, virtual worlds, live streaming, and generative AI transform the ways in which people meet, interact, communicate, and collaborate online; (2) IT innovation/making as a mechanism to broaden public participation in bottom-up technological innovation through online collaboration, such as independent game developers' and creative live streamers' engagement in shaping the trajectory of future technological advance; and (3) Understanding and designing novel social Virtual Reality technologies for more supportive and fulfilling online social experiences.
