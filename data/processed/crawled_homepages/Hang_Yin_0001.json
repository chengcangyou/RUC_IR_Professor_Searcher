I am enthusiastic about finding and integrating problem structures, such as task representation, dynamical systems and optimization-based control, to facilitate learning-based robotics. I believe this would be a promising path towards greater robot autonomy and intelligence, which are necessary for robots to closely serve or work with humans.I obtained my PhD from EPFL and IST, University of Lisbon under the supervision of Prof. Aude Billard, Prof. Ana Paiva and Prof. Francisco S. Melo. Prior to my current appointment, I was a post-docotoral researcher at the Robotics, Perception and Learning Group, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, mentored by Prof. Danica Kragic and co-leading research on deformable object manipulation, learning contact-rich tasks and multi-modal data generation and representation.",
