My current research interests are related to Cybersecurity, Software Engineering and Artificial Integllence. I am also the Programme Director for HP-NTU Digital Manufacturing Corp Lab, Deputy Director of the National Satellite of Excellence of Singapore and Cluster Director in Cybersecurity, Energy Research Institute @NTU. For model checking algorithms and tools, we are developing a model checker development framework Process Analysis Toolkit (PAT) development, which is a self-contained framework to support composing, simulating and reasoning of various systems (e.g., concurrent and real-time systems, probabilistic systems, web-service, security protocols, sensor networks, software architecture description language and so on). For cybersecurity, we are working at malware modeling, detection, classification and generation with the focus on Javascript malware (refer to AsiaCCS 2015 and ISSTA 2015 papers), desktop malware and Android malware (AsiaCCS 2016, IJCNN 2016, ISSTA 2016, TSE 2017). We are developing tools for vulnerability modeling and detection using machine learning and (both static and dynamic) program analysis on binary code (FSE 2016, ICSE 2017, S&P 2017, FSE 2017, FSE 2018, CCS 2018, ICSE 20`9, USENIX 2020). In our Securify research project (2015 - 2020), we are performing formal verification on security system from hardware (FM 2016 paper), hypervisor (ISSRE 2015, TACAS 2016, TACAS 2017, TDSC 2017, FM 2018), programs to security protocol (TSE 2017) using different verification approaches. Recently, we embark on the research on Automotive Security and autonomous vehicle Security in their security design, runtime security monitoring and response, and also the security testing and certification. For software engineering, we are working on the topics related to program specification learning and model learning (ASE 2013 and FSE 2015 papers), performance analysis (ICSE 2016 and ICSE 2018), Android energy analysis (TMC 2016 paper), reliability analysis (ISSTA 2014 paper), code clone analysis (ICSE 2014 FSE 2016, ASE 2017 and ASE 2018 papers), program debugging (ICSE 2017 paper), program testing (FSE 2017 paper), automatic loop analysis (ISSTA 2015, FSE 2016, FSE 2017, ASE 2017 and TSE 2018 papers), testing and validating deep learning algorithms (ASE 2018 and ISSRE 2018) using techniques like model checking, symbolic execution and machine learning. We are building tools related to these aspects. For Android system, we have been working on security analysis on App malware detection & classification (AsiaCCS 2016, IJCNN 2016, ISSTA 2016, TSE 2017), generation (TIFS 2017) and data analytic, App vulnerability analysis (ICSE 2021), App testing (FSE 2017, ICSE 2018, ASE 2018), Android OS testing and fuzzing, and Automatic UI generation (ICSE 2018). For artificial integllence, we are working on the topics related to AI's security, robustness, fairness and explanability. Please refer to our Deep-Series work (e.g., DeepMutation, DeepHunter, DeepStellar) and their applications. For big data, we are promoting the concept called event analytic based on behavior learning and analysis, and their applications in sports and finance systems (refer to our ICTAC 2014 and TASE 2015 invited papers).
