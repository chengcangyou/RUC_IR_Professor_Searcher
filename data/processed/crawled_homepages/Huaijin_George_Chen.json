My group aims to build cameras that capture the complete properties of light beyond human vision, including transient light transport, phase, polarization, and spectral information. We develop physics-informed AI methods to process and interpret these non-conventional imaging data. For real-world applications, we integrate these novel imagers into robotic platforms to advance multi-modal perception and vision-language-action (VLA) models, with a focus on agriculture and healthcare, where intelligent visual sensing enhances automation, safety, and accessibility. Prior to UHM, from 2022 to 2024, I was the founding Computational Imaging Lead at Vayu Robotics, focusing on enhancing autonomous vehicle perception through innovative imaging techniques. Vayu is backed by Khosla Ventures, and guided by Nobel laureate Geoffrey Hinton. From 2019 to 2022, I was with SenseBrain Technology, where I contributed to computational photography on smartphones. My team made strides in areas like novel image sensor, under-display camera tech, 3D ToF imaging, and neural image compression. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Rice University in 2019, focusing on physics-aware deep learning in computational imaging, and my B.S. in Imaging Science from RIT in 2013. As a student, I was fortunate to have the opportunities to visit research groups at Cornell, Northwestern, and Brown, and interned at NVIDIA Research, IBM, and Light Labs. I also co-founded and led SenseWatch, a startup focused on gesture recognition and vital sign monitoring for wearable devices. Grateful to my mentors and hosts for their support! news Oct 15, 2025 CIRP Lab @ ICCV 2025 — Two Workshop Papers, Invited Talk, and Local Chair Role Sep 16, 2025 Received a $300K NSF grant to study physics-informed VLM for ultrafast X-ray diffraction at the SLAC National Lab of Stanford University. Thank you, NSF and SLAC! Jul 31, 2025 Received $60K Hawaiʻi Community Foundation grant for computer vision-based early screening of mild cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s. Thank you, HCF!

Sep 01, 2024 I will serve as the local chair at ICCV 2025. Hope to see you at ICCV 2025 in Honolulu! Aug 01, 2024 I’ve joined University of Hawaii at Manoa as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Information and Computer Science. Jan 05, 2024 I’ll be demoing our Vayu Sense 3D sensing kit at CES 2024.",
