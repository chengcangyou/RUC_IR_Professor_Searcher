convex combination of the triangle corners. this concept can be extended in various ways to general convex polygons. one such extension are floater's mean value coordinates that even work for arbitrary polygons. this makes them an ideal tool for interpolation and particular applications in graphics are image warping and rendering of quadrilateral primitives. adapting the ideas to the univariate setting further leads to interesting rational interpolation schemes. for more details, visit the webpage of our minisymposium at the 10th siam conference on geometric design & computing. one of my main interests over the last few years has been in parameterization of triangle meshes and a good summary can be found in our survey. parameterization methods for triangle meshes with a simple, disc-like topology can be devided in two groups. linear methods are well understood and very fast but it is still unclear how the boundary should be treated. non-linear methods are able to solve this problem but remain a slow alternative even if hierarchical solvers are used. triangle meshes with arbitrary topology can be parameterized by segmenting them into disc-like patches, or by using a polycube as parameter domain. the latter option yields an ideal tool for texture mapping. for more details, visit the webpage of our courses at siggraph asia 2008 and siggraph 2007. subdivision is a great tool in graphics to get smooth curves and surfaces out of initial control polygons and control meshes. one of the most famous schemes for curves is the interpolating 4-point scheme that is based on local cubic interpolants. the idea of local cubic sampling can also be used to create a dual 4-point scheme, which is only approximating but has higher smoothness. remarkably, both schemes turn out to be the first two members of a whole family of schemes, all with cubic precision. i have also studied the structure of regular triangle meshes and developed a neat algorithm for detecting this regularity in a given mesh. an important application of parameterizations is found in reverse engineering, where they are an essential ingredient for fitting free form surfaces to 3d data points. a common pre-processing step is to first triangulate the input points and then approximate the triangulation. tensor product b-splines are still the most common free form surfaces in cad-based industrial design and the use of hierarchical surfaces improves performance considerably. it is even possible to reconstruct objects with arbitrary topology with b-spline patches. i have also studied other kinds of surface reconstruction, for example reconstructing terrain from contour lines and energy landscapes for shape-memory alloys. another application of parameterizations is remeshing. given a triangle mesh with arbitrary connectivity the task is to approximate it with a regular mesh. the most important regular meshes are triangle meshes with subdivision connectivity, but regular quadrilateral meshes are also of interest. last but not least i worked on the problem of optimizing triangle meshes using discrete curvature analysis. i have also worked with volumetric data and the extraction of iso-surfaces from ct-scans. in a cooperation with the archaeological institute, we were able to reconstruct the surfaces of historical artefacts with the aim of exhibiting them in a virtual museum one day. a little off my main research track, i got interested in computational geometry and discovered an efficient algorithm for clipping polygons, which was later extended to also handle degenerate intersections correctly. moreover, we analyzed various algorithms for deciding whether a point is in the interior of a polygon or exterior to it and developed a very efficient inside test that is apparently being used in matlab and R. phd students marta celio · generalized barycentric spaces · since 2025 navdeep bedi singh · coordinate-based representations of time-varying
