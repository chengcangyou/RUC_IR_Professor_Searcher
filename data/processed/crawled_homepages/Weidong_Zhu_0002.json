My research focuses on system security, with an emphasis on security and privacy protections in storage system, ransomware defense, trustworthy computing, software security, and hardware security.I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Computer & Information Security & Engineering at the University of Florida in 2025 advised by Dr. Kevin Butler and Dr. Sara Rampazzi. Before that, I received my master degree from Xiamen University in 2019 and got my bachelor degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2016.I’m actively looking for motivated and talented students to join my group to discover and solve real-world cybersecurity challenges in the software and hardware of computer systems. RA-ship is provided.If you are a undergraduate student at FIU, please consider enrolling in CNT4403 in Fall 2025 before reaching out to me with your research interests and CV.If you are a student not in my class or a student outside of FIU, please email me your research interests along with your CV. I will follow up to schedule interviews to discuss potential research opportunities.For perspective students, please carefully read my publications and research introductions. This will help you better understand my work and identify how your research interests may align.
