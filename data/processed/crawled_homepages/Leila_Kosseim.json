Together with Sabine Bergler, I co-direct the CLaC lab. I obtained my PhD from the University of Montreal in 1995 on the topic of Natural Language Generation.  Between 1995 and 1997, I obtained an NSERC Industrial Postdoctoral Fellowship and worked on the development of the Antidote Software at Druide informatique inc.  From 1998 to 2001, I then served as a lecturer and researcher at the University of Montreal within the RALI group.  In 2001, I then joined Concordia, and co-founded the CLaC (Computational Linguistics @Concordia).  Since then, I have graduated 9 PhD students and over 20 Master’s students.  I have had to honor to serve as Vice-President (2017-2019),  President (2019-2021) and Past-President (2021-2023) of the Canadian AI Association (CAIAC).",
