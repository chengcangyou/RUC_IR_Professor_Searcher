He obtained a PhD from the University of Southampton in 1988 for a thesis describing the piezoresistive effect in thick-film resistors. A paper based on this work was awarded the 1989 Educational Prize from the International Society for Hybrid Microelectronics (ISHM). Neil was appointed as a Lecturer within the School in 1990 and promoted to Senior Lecturer in 1999, Reader in 2000 and was awarded a personal Chair in 2002. He is co-author of the book Intelligent Sensor Systems, which was first published by the Institute of Physics Publishing",
