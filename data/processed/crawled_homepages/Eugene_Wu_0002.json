His goal is for users at all technical levels to effectively and quickly make sense of their information. He is interested in solutions that ultimately improve the interface between users and data, and uses techniques borrowed from fields such as data management, systems, crowd sourcing, visualization, and HCI. Eugene Wu received his Ph.D. from MIT, B.S. from Cal, and was a postdoc in the AMPLab. A profile, an obit. Eugene Wu has received the VLDB 2018 10-year test of time award, best-of-conference citations at ICDE and VLDB, the SIGMOD 2016 best demo award, the NSF CAREER, and the Google, Adobe, and Amazon faculty awards.

A new class of visual analytic systems is one part of it. I am broadly interested in problems where academic research has a competitive advantage. Applicants should read The PhD Application from a Facultyâs Perspective PhDs: read recent work of interest, provide evidence you can conduct research, include âbananasâ in the subject line. Postdocs: how you can best make use of the lab? whatâs a project we could work on? Include âsatsumaâ in the subject line. Interns + UGrad + Masters: Fill out this form. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, your best bet is to find and talk to a grad student in the lab instead of emailing me directly. Recent News July-2025: Columbia data management had a strong showing at SIGMOD 2025 with a test-of-time award, best demo award, best paper award at DEEM, 5 papers, a keynote, a workshop, a tutorial, and a panel! Nov-2023: Excited to present our vision of Task-based Dataset Search at CIDR 2024 in January and our vision about using documentation to tackle data ambiguity at the Table Representation Learning Workshop at NeurIPS 2023. Aug-2023: We will be presenting 4 papers at VLDB! Saibot brings differential privacy to task-based dataset search platforms, Joinboost trains decision trees, radom forests, and gradient boosted models within DBMSes faster than ML libraries like LightGBM and XGBoost, Pollock introduces a benchmark and grammar-based formalization for studying CSV loaders, and ConnectorX is the fastest way for DataFrame systems to load data from DBMSes. Excited to see folks in Vancouver!
