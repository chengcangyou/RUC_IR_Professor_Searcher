I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Princeton University and have served as a visiting professor at both Princeton University and Cornell Tech. My research focuses on computer graphics, computer vision, and machine learning. In 2025, I was honored to be named a Eurographics Fellow and to join the SMI Steering Committee. Among my recent activities, I served as the Diversity Panel Chair at Eurographics 2024 and am currently serving as a program chair for ICCV 2025. A selection of articles, talks, and interviews offers a closer look at my research and perspectives. A one-hour interview on Reshet Aleph (2016) discusses research, creativity, and women in engineering and the exact sciences (in Hebrew). In 2019, I participated in a shorter interview and a related article discussing women in science and engineering. In 2020, I delivered a Google Talk offering an in-depth look at my research. More recently, I gave a presentation at the Visual Computing Trends 2025 conference on visual analysis in specialized domains, and an interview in Der Standard (in German). I also delivered a talk at the 'LandMarks' Exhibition, celebrating women who have left their mark on the Technion in honor of its 100th anniversary.
