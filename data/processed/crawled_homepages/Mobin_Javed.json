My research focuses on: {Internet Security, Privacy, and Measurements} Prior to joining LUMS, I was a post-doc at ICSI, Berkeley. I completed my Ph.D. from UC Berkeley in 2016, where I had the good fortune of being advised by Vern Paxson. I am a data enthusiast at heart, and enjoy the art of mining large-scale datasets to uncover interesting information that can both (i) enhance our understanding of the state of Internet, and (ii) lead to better defenses against Internet threats.
