My work aims to develop rigorous computational approaches for understanding evolutionary relationships and processes. My main research topics includes tree reconciliation between gene and species trees, inference of species trees or networks from gene trees, modeling evolutionary scenarios, detecting horizontal gene transfers and genomic duplications, metagenomics, bootstrapping methods for trees and networks, and exploring the mathematical properties of tree and network comparison functions. Computational Genomics Group The research group consists of Prof. Jerzy Tiuryn, Dr. JarosÅaw Paszek, and Dr. Agnieszka Mykowiecka. We have a long-standing collaboration with Prof. Oliver Eulenstein from Iowa State University and his Computational Biology Lab. Additional collaborators on related topics include Dr. Alexey Markin (USDA-ARS), Dr. Tavis Anderson (USDA-ARS), Dr. Anna Muszewska (IBB PAN) and Dr. Szymon KieÅbasa (LUMC). Our alumni include Natalia Rutecka, Arkadiusz Betkier, PaweÅ Tabaszewski, Dawid DÄ bkowski and Dr. MichaÅ Ciach. Students and Researchers If you are interested in writing a bachelor's, master's, or Ph.D. thesis under my supervision, feel free to contact me. I offer topics of algorithmic, computational, programming, or theoretical nature, depending on your background and interests. With Prof. Norbert Dojer, we invite you to join our Master's seminar on Bioinformatics and Computational Genomics. Check also our Computational Biology and Bioinformatics working seminar BOB.

If you're interested, feel free to reach out. Short Biography I hold an M.Sc. in Computer Science (1999) and an M.Sc. in Mathematics (2000), both from the University of Warsaw. In 2006, I completed Ph.D. in Computer Science, specializing in theoretical and algorithmic methods for detecting horizontal gene transfers. A significant part of my dissertation was devoted to the formal modelling of evolutionary scenarios. Since 2019, I have been an Associate Professor (profesor uczelni in Polish) at the Institute of Informatics, Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics, and Mechanics at the University of Warsaw. In 2006 and 2007, I was a Research Fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin. I have been a member of the Polish Bioinformatics Society since 2008.
