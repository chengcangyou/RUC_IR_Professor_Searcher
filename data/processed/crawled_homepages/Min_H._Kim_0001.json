Kim (ê¹ë¯¼í êµì, ì¹´ì´ì¤í¸ ì ì°íë¶), KAIST Visual Computing Lab (VCLAB), School of Computing - Computer Graphics/Vision/Imaging/Color RESEARCH AREAS PEOPLE PUBLICATIONS COURSES ABOUT US Home / People / Min H. Kim Min H. Kim Chair Professor [e-mail] [Lab. phone] +82-42-350-7864 Dr. Min H. Kim (ê¹ë¯¼í) is the KAIST ICT-Endowed Chair Professor of Computer Science at the KAIST School of Computing. He heads the Visual Computing Lab (VCLAB). Before joining KAIST, he was a postdoctoral researcher at Yale University. He obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science from University College London (UCL). His research interests encompass computational imaging, computational photography, hyperspectral imaging, 3D imaging/reconstruction, and reflectance acquisition. His work has been acknowledged at prestigious conferences, including receiving a SIGGRAPH Technical Paper Award Honorable Mention in 2022. Aside from his research, he has held active roles in the academic community, such as serving as the Technical Paper Chair for Eurographics 2022 and the Course Chair for SIGGRAPH Asia 2022. Additionally, he has been a member of program committees for leading conferences such as SIGGRAPH, SIGGRAPH Asia, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, and Eurographics. Furthermore, his editorial experience includes serving as an associate editor for reputable journals in computer science, such as ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG) and IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI). He is a general member of the National Academy of Engineering of Korea since 2025. His full CV is [here].
