  "content": "Future Architecture and System Technology for Scalable Computing For future scalable computing systems, we explore not only processor, memory and IO subsystem architectures but also system hardware and software together. Especially, we aim to prototype our cool concepts with various implementation technologies and demonstrate them with commercial systems although we evaluate them with simulators. We have aimed to impact the industry research and development with our proposals, and our proposals have been evaluated and/or adopted by big tech companies. Our recent research focuses on exploring cool memory and networking technologies such as Compute eXpress Link (CXL) based memory modules and various SmartNICs to make large-scale computer systems more efficient in terms of performance, energy consumption, and cost.
