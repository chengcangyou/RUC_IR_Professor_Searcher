Her research interests span the areas of software verification, security and applied cryptography, automated reasoning, and code synthesis. Much of her research has focused on using formal techniques to improve software reliability and trustworthiness. Piskac joined Yaleâs Department of Computer Science in 2013. She was previously an Independent Research Group Leader at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems in Germany. Her research has received a range of professional honors, including multiple Amazon Research Awards, Yale Universityâs Ackerman Award for Teaching and Mentoring, the Facebook Communications and Networking Award, and the Microsoft Research Award for the Software Engineering Innovation Foundation (SEIF). In 2019, Yale named Piskac the Donna L. Dubinsky Associate Professor of Computer Science. Piskac holds a Ph.D. from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL), where her dissertation won the Patrick Denantes Prize. Her current and recent professional activities include service as Program Chair of the 37th International Conference on Computer Aided Verification and the Steering Committee of the Formal Methods in Computer-Aided Design conference. Piskac has graduated five PhD students, four of them are currently holding a position of an assistant professor of computer science.
