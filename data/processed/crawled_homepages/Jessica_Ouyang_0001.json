My research interests are in natural language processing, specifically in the areas of summarization and computational narrative. I received my PhD from Columbia University in 2019, advised by Professor Kathleen McKeown. My dissertation was about adapting automatic summarization to new sources of information; here is a talk I gave at Johns Hopkins about my dissertation work. My CV is here. Prospective/Incoming Students: If you are interested in working with me, I do not accept research students until after they have taken a course with me. The courses I teach are listed below.
