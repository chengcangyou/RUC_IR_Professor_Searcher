I received my BSc, MS, and PhD degrees from Bilkent University Computer Engineering Department. Before joining here, I was a post-doctoral researcher at Boston University Computer Science Department, working with Prof. Stan Sclaroff and was a member of the Image and Video Computing Group. Between Feb 2005 and June 2006, I was a visiting scholar at UIUC working with Prof. David Forsyth in the Computer Vision Group. I am one of the cofounders of HU Computer Vision Lab. My primary area of research is computer vision and machine learning, focusing models on deep learning. I am particularly interested in human action/activity understanding, sign language recognition, zero-shot/few-shot learning, and image/video captioning.
