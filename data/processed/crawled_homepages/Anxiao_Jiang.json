We currently focus on coding for non-volatile memories, coding for natural redundancy (an intersection of coding theory and machine learning) and deep learning. Prof. Anxiao (Andrew) Jiang Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering (courtesy appointment) Texas A&M University Office: 309B Bright Building Email: ajiang@cse.tamu.edu Dr. Anxiao (Andrew) Jiang received the B.Sc. degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China in 1999, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California in 2000 and 2004, respectively. He is currently an Associate Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department and the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department (courtesy appointment) at Texas A&M University. He has held visiting positions at California Institute of Technology, University of California in San Diego and Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), and has been a consulting researcher at HP Labs, EMC and Microsoft Research. His research interests include information theory and coding theory, data storage, machine learning, networks and algorithm design. Prof. Jiang is a recipient of the NSF CAREER Award in 2008 for his research on information theory for flash memories and a recipient of the 2009 IEEE Communications Society Best Paper Award in Signal Processing and Coding for Data Storage. He also received the award for second place in the ECCV'2018 Chalearn LAP Inpainting Competition (Track 3: Fingerprint Denoising and Inpainting). He is a senior member of IEEE, and an associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Information Theory. Here is Prof. Jiang's CV.
