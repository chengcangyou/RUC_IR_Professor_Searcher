He received his PhD from Grenoble University, France, in 1999, supervised by Claude Puech and George Drettakis. From 1999 till 2002, he was a post-doc in the MIT Computer Graphics Group with Julie Dorsey. He works both on synthetic image generation and computational photography, where new algorithms afford powerful image enhancement and the design of imaging system that can record richer information about a scene. His research interests span most aspects of picture generation and creation, from rendering to computational photography. He works on differentiable rendering, compilers for high-performance imaging, and video magnification He co-organized the first Symposium on Computational Photography and Video in 2005, the first International Conference on Computational Photography in 2009, and was on the advisory board of the Image and Meaning 2 conference. He received an inaugural Eurographics Young Researcher Award in 2004, an NSF CAREER award in 2005, an inaugural Microsoft Research New Faculty Fellowship in 2005, a Sloan fellowship in 2006, a Spira award for distinguished teaching in 2007, and the ACM SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics Achievement Award in 2016. He is on the scientific advisory board of Mercari, light.co, Shaper Tools.

In particular see my draft of notes on writing, notes on giving a talk, slides about reviewing & ethics, and slides about jobs.

See also my notes on writing. 6.815 Digital and Computational Photography 6.865 Advanced Computational Photography For the keynote slides see here and here (the 2012 and 2011 offerings were different enough that you want both. And see here for older and also different powerpoints.) see also the 2006 offering, the 2007 version, the 2008 vintage the 2009 iteration, and ENS version, and the 2011 rerun, 2012 (switched to Python), 2013 (added Halide), 2015 (switch to C++). I also taught a frehsman seminar, 6.A44, on the same topic. Original (keynote and ppt conversion) are available for 2011 and 2012. You might want to check out both because the course changed quite a bit. 6.837 Intro to Computer Graphics Also: Fall 2010, Fall 2008, Fall 06, Fall 04, Fall 03, Fall 02 6.839 Advanced Computer Graphics The Art and Science of Depiction This class explores perceptual and technical aspect of pictures, and more precisely the depiction of reality on a 2D medium. The focus is on an in-breadth multidisciplinary approach. Here are the slides of a talk I gave at the University College of London to outline the class. And here is a more recent version given at Stanford (1 slide per page or 6 slides per page) Perceptual and Artistic Principles for Effective Computer Depiction SIGGRAPH 2002 Course, together with Maneesh Agrawala, Bruce Gooch, Victoria Interrante, Victor Ostromoukhov and Denis Zorin.
