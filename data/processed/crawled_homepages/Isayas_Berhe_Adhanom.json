My research focuses on advancing Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR) systems by exploring and addressing the diverse technical challenges and user experience factors that influence their usability, accessibility, and overall effectiveness. My research broadly draws knowledge from the fields of Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Graphics, AI and Cognitive Neuroscience. In addition to my research, I am actively engaged in service to the VR/AR community, having served in leadership roles as co-chair for leading international conferences including IEEE VR and ACM VRST, as well as as a program committee member for IEEE VR, IEEE ISMAR, ACM VRST, ACM SUI and ISVC. Previously, I was a President’s Postdoctoral Fellow at the Illusioneering Lab at the University of Minnesota working with Dr. Evan Suma Rosenberg. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Nevada-Reno, advised by Eelke Folmer and Paul MacNeilage. Previously, I completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering at UNR and my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering at Eritrea Institute of Technology. I have received several awards for my academic and research achievements, most notably the CSE Outstanding Dissertation Award and the Graduate Dean’s Fellowship at the University of Nevada, Reno, and the President’s Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of Minnesota. I have joined the Department of Computer Science at Texas State University as a tenure-track Assistant Professor in Fall 2024. I am actively seeking undergraduate, masters and PhD students to join and establish my new lab.
