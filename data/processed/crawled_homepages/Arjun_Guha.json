For the past few years, I have primarily been focused on (1) program synthesis for \"low-resource\" programming languages--these are languages that are not Python, Java, etc. but are widely used in specialized fields, such as scientific computing--and (2) understanding how computer science education is impacted by large language models. Here are three representative papers on this work: MultiPL-E: A Scalable and Extensible Approach to Benchmarking Neural Code Generation Knowledge Transfer from High-Resource to Low-Resource Programming Languages for Code LLMs How Beginning Programmers and Code LLMs (Mis)read Each Other I teach a variety of undergraduate and graduate courses. I have been the lead instructor for Northeastern's CS1 course several times, designed several new courses, and taught graduate seminars on topics as varied as Code LLM development and program verification. I also serve as the Area Chair for Software at Northeastern's Khoury College of Computer Sciences.
