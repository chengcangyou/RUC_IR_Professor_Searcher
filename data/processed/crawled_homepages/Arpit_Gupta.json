I co-direct the Systems and Networking Lab (SNL) at UCSB, where I have been utilizing my system-building skills to address a variety of pressing digital inequity challenges, namely, ensuring secure, performant, and affordable “Internet for All.” To this end, my current research focuses on democratizing the development of production-ready ML artifacts for self-driving networks (to ensure performant and secure connectivity with limited infrastructure and operational resources) and enabling data-driven policymaking (to ensure performant and affordable connectivity with limited capital resources).

Please find more details about this project in this article. Jan 2025: Our paper, Assessing the Efficacy of the Connect America Fund in Addressing Internet Access Inequities in the US, ACM SIGCOMM, 2024, received the Applied Networking Prize (ANRP) from IETF/IRTF. Kudos to Haarika Manda and team for yet another recognition for their awesome work! 🏆 Dec 2024: Chaofan Shou presented our work on query planning for hybrid network telemetry systems at CoNEXT, 2024. This brings an end to our long (and painful) journey on this project. Nov 2024: I had the privilege to talk about our efforts to develop production-ready ML models for networking at Google’s AIOps Summit. Exciting times for networking! Nov 2024: I had the privilege of contributing to a webinar hosted by The Networking Channel on Internet Measurements: The User Perspective. The recording of the webinar is available here. Mar 2024: Our paper, Leveraging Prefix Structure to Detect Volumetric DDoS Attack Signatures with Programmable Switches, got accepted at IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (S&P), 2024. Kudos to Chris Misa for all the hard work and perseverance. This is the first work that demonstrates how we can leverage the fractal (self-similar) nature of IP addresses to design a more effective DDoS defense system, targeted primarily for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This work is in line with my various ongoing efforts in our group that aim to ensure secure and performant Internet connectivity for All. Jan 2024: Our paper, Query Planning for Robust and Scalable Hybrid Network Telemetry Systems, got accepted at CoNEXT, 2024. Kudos to Chaofan Shou, a prodigious UCSB graduate, for his super-heroic effort. This work builds upon Sonata, developing a novel query planning technique to effectively handle changes in traffic or query workloads. This project holds special significance for me as a mentor because the lead author, Chaofan Shou, was an undergraduate at UCSB when he completed this project. Aug 2023: Our paper, In Search of netUnicorn: A Data-Collection Platform to Develop Generalizable ML Models for Network Security Problems, got accepted at ACM CCS’23. Kudos to Roman for developing such an impressive and useful system! Please find more information about the project here. June 2023: Udit Paul received the Computer Science Outstanding Publication Award. 🏆 June 2023: Udit Paul received the Computer Science Outstanding Dissertation Award. 🏆 May 2023: Our paper, Decoding the Divide: Analyzing Disparities in Broadband Plans Offered by Major US ISPs, got accepted at SIGCOMM’23.
