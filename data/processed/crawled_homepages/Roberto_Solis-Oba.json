Most of my research has centered on the design of approximation algorithms. However, I am interested also in the design of efficient data structures, parallel algorithms, distributed algorithms, online algorithms, and randomized algorithms. Application areas from where most of the problems that I have studied come from are: networks, scheduling, packing problems, resource allocation, Computational Biology, and data mining. Publications A list of my publications can be found here Background I graduated from . . Purdue University under the supervision of I was a postdoctoral fellow at the . .
