Cheriton School of Computer Science University of Waterloo Email: [first_name].[family_name]@uwaterloo.ca Research At the University of Waterloo, I lead the Software Repository Excavation and Build Engineering Labs (the Software REBELs). Broadly speaking, my students and I perform empirical studies that mine the historical data that is generated during the development of large-scale software systems. Specifically, my research focuses on release engineering (i.e., the process of assembling, verifying, and delivering releases of software systems from its sources) and software quality (i.e., deriving practical guidelines for developing more reliable software systems).
