I got my phd degree from the University of Padova, Italy (very fortune to be supervised by Massimo Melucci and Emanuele Di Buiccio). See our lab on CUHKSZ LLM group. I submit my thesis in Sep. 30th 2021 （Here is a draft version）and have it defended in March 2022. I joined CUHKSZ as an assistant professor from June 1st 2022. Please send me emails if you are interested to work with me as a Ph.D., research associate, or post-doc. See JD here News We won the Gold Medal in AIMO 2 (AI Mathematical Olympiad). 该项工作是和华为诺亚方舟实验室合作，Thank Lifeng and Xu Yan.
