Tak-Wah Lam graduated with a BSc in Computer Science from the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 1984 and received his MS & PhD in Computer Science from the University of Washington in 1988.  Since then he has been with the University of Hong Kong.  He is now a professor in the Department of Computer Science.  He was an associate dean of the Faculty of Engineering from 2001 to 2006. He has received several teaching awards from the department and faculty, and more recently an outstanding supervisor award from the university. Tak-Wahs research is mainly on the design and analysis of algorithms for different applications. His work has spanned the areas of compressed text indexing, computational biology, and scheduling.   Fourteen doctoral students have graduated under his supervision.  A few of them remained as academics in Hong Kong or overseas. Apart from theoretical work, he is keen on collaborating with the genomics industry, like BGI and Novogene, on applying some latest data structures and algorithms to build advanced software tools for bioinformatics.  The most recognized example is the alignment software SOAP2/SOAP3/SOAP3-dp. Outside of work, he enjoys playing basketball and tennis with his two sons.   Due to his back & shoulder problems, he disciplines himself to go to the swimming pool regularly.  More recently, he has quitted practicing Tai Chi due to knee pain.
