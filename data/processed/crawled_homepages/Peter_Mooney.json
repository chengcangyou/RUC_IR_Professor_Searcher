Kildare, Ireland. Lat/Long:53.385267,-6.601603 Eircode: W23 F2H6 Ph: +353 (1) 708 3849 Email: peter [DOT] Mooney [AT] mu [DOT] ie My research interests I am a very ambitious and highly motivated researcher and teacher who has an excellent record of scholarly work and publication of international quality. In my career I have developed extensive experience of collaboration with national and international scientific networks, institutions and bodies. I have already become a significant contributor in my field of research and expertise and subsquently have built significant research capacity and integration into scientific networks. I am a passionate user and advocate for Open Source Software and Open Data. My research revolves around spatial data - I'm really interested in applying Computer Science methodologies and approaches to how any type of data with a geographic or spatial component can be: analysed, visualised, checked, re-used, and so on. This incorporates considering data for the challenges around sustainability and protection of the environment. My major research interests are listed below: Volunteered Geographic Information and Citizen Science OpenStreetMap - research on OpenStreetMap data, community, software Open Source Software and Open Data The quality and use of Volunteered Geographic Information by govenments and authoritative agencies Geocomputation: spatial data mining, machine learning with geographical applications and relevance Spatial Databases and management of spatial data ICT for environmental sustainability and protection Artificial Intelligence in Teaching and Learning Artificial Intelligence and the Circular Economy Smart Farming in Ireland Publications and Research Outputs You'll find listings of my publications in the usual places: Google Scholar (Link ), ORCID (Link ), Semantic Scholar (Link ), and the dblp Computer Science bibliography (Link ). If you cannot find a publication attributed to me then just drop me an email. Very happy to share the author version with you.

Whilst not doing my day job you'll find me: running, taking photographs (see my Flickr profile) and enjoying the beauty of the midlands of Ireland, and tending to my vegetable and flower gardens. Running is a particular passion of mine and in the past few years I have set reasonably fast personal bests over different distances on the roads including: 2h:28m for the marathon, 1h:12m for the half marathon, 3h:16m for 50 Kilometers, and 15m:33s for 5KM. Since I started running in 2002 I have completed 94 marathons - which includes over 70 sub 3 hour marathons, 50 sub 2:50 marathons and 26 sub 2:40 marathons.",
