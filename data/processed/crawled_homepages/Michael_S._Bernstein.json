By changing these computing platforms, we change human behavior: as Winston Churchill said, “We shape our buildings; thereafter they shape us.” How do we design these computing systems effectively and responsibly? My research in human-computer interaction advances systems, designs, and models for social computing systems. In doing so, I aim to shed light on long-standing research questions: How do we cross the gap between social scientific knowledge and concrete system designs that manifest this knowledge into pro-social interactions? How can we model human attitudes and behavior to help us craft technology and social policy? How should we design our computational tools if we want them to be successfully embedded into society? Bio: Michael Bernstein is a Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University, where he is a Bass University Fellow and Senior Fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. A nationally bestselling author, Michael focuses on designing social, societal, and interactive technologies. This research has been reported in venues such as The New York Times, TED AI, and MIT Technology Review, and Michael himself has been recognized with an Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship and the Computer History Museum's Tech for Humanity Prize. Michael holds a bachelor's degree in Symbolic Systems from Stanford University, as well as a master's degree and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from MIT.
