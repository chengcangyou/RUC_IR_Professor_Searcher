Before joining Tsinghua I was a researcher at VISA Research. In 2018 I got my Ph.D. from Boston University under the guidance of Professor Ran Canetti and Professor Leonid Reyzin. I attended college at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I was seduced to science by an interesting problem. My research interest is cryptography. As cryptographers, our mission is to spread love with mystery. Occasionally I make comic slides to carry out my duty; see samples \"Merkletree\", \"Napoleon\", \"Howareyou\", \"VAR\", \"KuleshovEffect\". Publications My research focuses on cryptography, and its connection to complexity theory and other disciplines in computer science and mathematics. My main interests are making hard mathematical problems useful for privacy protection, and showing that some conjectured hard problems are in fact easy.
