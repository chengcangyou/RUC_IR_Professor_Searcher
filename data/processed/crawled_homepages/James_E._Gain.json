My interest lie in the areas of Computer Graphics (specifically geometry and modelling) and Virtual Reality. My research takes place as part of the CVC group at UCT. Projects Authoring Digital Landscapes Simulated natural phenomena, encompassing terrain, river networks, ecosystems, and weather effects are an essential feature in many games, films, and virtual environments. My research in this area is focused on the trifecta of visual realism, computational efficiency and authoring control. This is achieved through a mix of procedural, simulation and data-driven approaches and coupled with sketching and painting interfaces. Interaction in Virtual Reality The output side of Virtual Reality, in the form of Head Mounted Displays, is highly effective, but the input side, typically using hand-held controllers, is less mature. My focus here is on exploiting the sense of touch (haptics) to enhance task performance and immersion, while reducing simulator sickness. More generally, I am also interested in the application of Virtual Reality to scientific visualisation and design tasks.
