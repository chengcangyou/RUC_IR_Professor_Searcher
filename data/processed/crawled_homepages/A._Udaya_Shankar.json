I'm interested in both correctness analysis and performance analysis. One area of current work is a framework, based on assertional reasoning, for writing correct distributed programs. The theory for the framework, called Sesf, is in this (text). I'm currently developing tutorial-level software for this framework, specifically, a suite of distributed programs and a testing harness. Here is a preliminary version. Another area of current work is timestep stochastic simulation of networks of TCP and UDP flows. Unlike traditional packet-level simulation, the network state is updated probabilistically at steps of time. This results in fast simulation, especially for high-speed networks. Details and a simulator (tssnet) are available here. Selected Publications PhD students TS Eliot: prufrock, hippopotamus",
