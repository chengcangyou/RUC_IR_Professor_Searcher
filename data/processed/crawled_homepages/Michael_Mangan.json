He joined the Lincoln Centre for Autonomous Systems in April, 2016. Research interests Dr Mangan's primary research focuses on modelling the navigational behaviour of insects, which are able to travel through complex environments robustly despite their limited nervous and sensory systems. Revealing the sensory and algorithmic underpinning of these capabilities will not only aid the understanding of biological systems but may also offer engineering solutions - building robots able to navigate as well as the humble ant.
