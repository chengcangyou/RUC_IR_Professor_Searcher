I study algorithms, working at the intersection of theoretical computer science, numerical linear algebra, and machine learning. My group's research is supported in part by an NSF CAREER Award and a Google Research Scholar Award. I completed my Ph.D. in the Theory of Computation Group at MIT, advised by Nancy Lynch. Before MIT, I studied Computer Science and Applied Math at Yale. Here are my Google Scholar profile, CV, and GitHub. Courses COMPSCI 514: Algorithms for Data Science, Fall 2024.
