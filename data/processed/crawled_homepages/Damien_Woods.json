Prior lives: Inria: I led a research group at Inria, Paris, France, 2016-2018. Caltech: I spent 7 years at Caltech, USA (2009-2016). I finished up there as a Senior Research Fellow in Computing and Mathematical Sciences, and a Molecular Programming Fellow working, with Erik Winfree and Shuki Bruck, in the Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences and affiliated with the Center for the Mathematics of Information. Seville: I was a postdoc in the Research Group on Natural Computing at the University of Seville, Spain. UCC: At University College Cork I was a postdoc at the Boole Centre For Research in Informatics and the School of Mathematics with Tony Seda, and the Cork Complex Systems Lab (CCSL) with Gregory Provan.
