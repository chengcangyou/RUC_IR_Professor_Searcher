I have also been a post-doc in the Department of Computer Science at City University (2006-2008) working with Prof. George Spanoudakis and a lecturer at King's College London (2004-2005). I hold a MEng degree in Computer Science (Software Engineering) from Imperial College London, and a PhD in Computer Science from King's College. My research interests are centered around specification and verification of software, in modelling, analysing and understanding specifications, proving that they satisfy properties of interest and creating tools for supporting their development. I have considered challenges introduced by different application domains, such as safety critical systems, security critical systems, mobile peer-to-peer and ambient intelligent systems. Currently, I am interested in the development of static analysis algorithms, specifically slicing, for Extended Finite State Machines in order to enhance comprehension and for model debugging. I maintain a bib file of papers on slicing state-based models. This includes papers mentioned in the ACM Computing Surveys paper: \"State-based Model Slicing: A Survey\", published in 2013.
