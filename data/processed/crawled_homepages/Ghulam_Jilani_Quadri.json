Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow and CRA/CCC/NSF Computing Innovation Fellow and worked with Dr. Danielle Albers Szafir in the Department of Computer Science at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science & Engineering, advised by Dr. Paul Rosen at the University of South Florida in 2021. I hold an M.S. in Computer Science from the University of South Florida and a Bachelor in Computer Engineering from the University of Mumbai. My research interests lies at the intersection of Information Visualization, HCI, ML Models, and perception & cognition. My primary goal is to create a perceptual and human-centered framework to optimize visualization design, improving decision-making quality and confidence, while providing objective guidance for designers. In my work, I borrow approaches from InfoVis and perception & cognitive science and apply human-centered evaluation to measure, model, and theorize human perception of data and visual design. My dissertation research work in this space received the IEEE VGTC Best Dissertation award for contributing new ways to measure, model, and construct task-optimized visualizations. My postdoc research is supported by NSF-CRA Computing Innovation 2021 Fellowship. My research collaborations span various applications, including design-oriented perceptual research projects to create robust design choices model, perceptual variability, design optimization, and information accessibility. My recent work on perceptual variability received Best Paper Honorable Mention Award for CLAMS at IEEE VIS 2023. Along with my collaborators, I have received awards for an honorable mention for the VAST Challenge at IEEE VIS 2017, best short paper at EuroVis 2024, and an honorable mention for the poster at IEEE VIS 2024. If you're interested in a project, please reach out to me . News and Updates September 2024 We have a panel discussion proposal (Yet Another) Evaluation Needed?
