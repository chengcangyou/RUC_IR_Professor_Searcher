Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Welcome message from President Clements It is an exciting time to be at Clemson University! Clemson remains ranked among the top national public universities in the country and we have been reaffirmed as an R-1 institution, one of the highest-level research universities in the nation, by the Carnegie Classification. And we were recently named among the top three most trusted public universities in the nation. Since 2013, I have been honored to lead Clemson as we continue to raise the bar in admissions, enrollment, research, diversity, retention and graduation rates. As much as we have accomplished already, the future is even brighter. As an institution, we are committed to our students, faculty and staff. We ensure that our priorities of academic success, student experience, research and innovation, public service and economic development drive everything we do. We continue to be guided by our values of integrity, respect, diversity, patriotism, excellence, and self-reliance. The Clemson Family is something very special and very real, and my family and I are honored to be a part of that legacy. Whether you are a current or prospective student, an employee, an alumnus, a parent, or a visitor, we are happy to share with you the many things that make Clemson University and the Clemson community so special. Joe Sherman, Class of 1934, captured the essence of Clemson when he wrote, \"There's something in these hills where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness.\" I can assure you that whatever that \"something\" is – it will stay with you and this great University forever. Sincerely,James P. \"Jim\" Clements, Ph.D. Engage With President Clements! Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Clemson Traditions Faculty and Staff Research at Clemson Brook T.
