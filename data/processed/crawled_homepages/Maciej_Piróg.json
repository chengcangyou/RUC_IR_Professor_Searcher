At the moment, I am working on modelling effects (like I/O) in type theory.BiographyI came to the city of dreaming spires straight from Wroclaw, Poland, where I graduated from the local university. I was awarded the title of MSc in computer science, and my thesis was entitled Toward a certified Haskell compiler: Correctness and implementation of the Spineless Tagless G-machine verified in the Coq proof assistant (I really enjoyed the length of the title at that time). Now, I am working hard to become a doctor of philosophy.Selected PublicationsView AllManage publications From Push/Enter to Eval/Apply by Program Transformation Maciej Piróg and Jeremy Gibbons In Olivier Danvy and Ugo de'Liguoro, editors, Proceedings of the Workshop on Continuations.
