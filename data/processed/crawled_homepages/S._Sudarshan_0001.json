Nilekani Chair Professor Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Bombay Schedule Publications Research Areas Professional Activities Courses Students Other Stuff Contact Publications Database System Concepts 7th Ed., by Silberschatz, Korth and Sudarshan, released March 2019. Publications (My entry in the DBLP bibliography, and my profile in Google Scholar) Research Areas My main research area is database systems . Current sub areas of interest include Holistic optimization spanning the programming language/SQL boundary. This project addresses optimization of database applications where the bottleneck is in the programming language -- database interface. We have developed techniques for automated rewriting of database applications, which can replace iterative invocation of queries by creating query batches, or asynchronous query invocation, and in other cases replace blocks of code by equivalent SQL queries. This work spans the boundaries of programming language static analysis and database query optimization. For details see the home page of the DBridge Project at http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/dbms/dbridge. Query Optimization. The Pyro query optimization project, which is based on the Volcano/Cascades framework, has run for many years, with early work focusing on multiquery optimization and parametric query optimization. More recently we have been working on handling query optimization for parallel databases, including optimization of response time, or more generally multi-objective query optimization, which add non-trivial complexity to the optimization problem. For details see the home page of the Pyro/PyroJ project at http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/dbms/pyro. Testing Database Queries and Applications. The XData project focuses on how to test the correctness of database queries, and more generally, database applications, by generating datasets that are designed to catch errors. We have developed techniques for data generation which can handle a wide variety of queries, and catch a wide variety of common errors. We have also developed a tool for checking correctness of student queries, which can greatly help instructors of database courses. Earlier work in this area focused on checking for serializablity of applications running under weak levels of consistency. For more details, see the home page of the XData project at http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/dbms/xdata. Keyword Search on Databases Soumen Chakrabarti and I lead the BANKS project which aims at supporting keyword queries on structured and semi-structured databases. Earlier work focused on keyword queries on structured data. More recently we have worked on keyword queries on a mix of structured and unstructured data, and on providing more expressive power, while retaining the ability to query data without knowledge of the exact schema or entity indentifiers, by using the Entity-Relationship querying model. Currently, we are focusing on the above forms of queries, but on data represented using RDF. For more details, see the home page of the BANKS project at http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/banks. Earlier areas include: Main Memory Databases : I was one of the founders of the DataBlitz main memory database project in Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, and also worked on failure recovery error checking and fault tolerance issues, in main memory databases while at Bell Labs. Indexing for Write-Intensive Workloads Deductive Databases: My PhD thesis was on deductive databases, with a focus on query evaluation and semantics for extensions of Datalog with non-stratified negation, aggregation, and non-ground/structured data.
