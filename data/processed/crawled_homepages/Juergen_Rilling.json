Throughout the years the research expanded to the software engineering domain, introducing a knowledge graph will provide a novel infrastructure that promotes sharing of knowledge and analysis results, while at the same time, promoting the development and reuse of new global source code analysis services to support typical programming and software evolution tasks through these newly created information hubs. These knowledge graphs form not are key for establishing traceability but also can form the basis to explainable AI. It is with deep sadness to announce the passing of Dr. Ellis Eghan at the young age of 35. Ellis was my PhD student and completed his PhD in 2017. We are all deeply saddened by this loss. Google SitesReport abuseGoogle SitesReport abuse",
