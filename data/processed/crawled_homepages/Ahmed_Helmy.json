Eng. Math '94 & B.S. in EE '92 from Cairo University, Egypt. He was a key researcher in the Network Simulator NS-2 and Protocol-Independent Multicast (PIM) projects (with Prof. Deborah Estrin) at USC/ISI from '95-99. Before joining UF in '06, he was on the EE Dept faculty at USC starting Fall '99, where he founded and directed the Wireless & Sensor Networks Labs. In '02, he received the National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Award for his research on resource discovery and mobility modeling in large-scale wireless networks (MARS ['02-'08]). In '00 he received the Zumberge Award, and in '02 he received the best paper award from the IEEE/IFIP MMNS Conference. In '03 he was the EE nominee for the USC Engineering Jr. Faculty Research Award, and a nominee for the Sloan Fellowship. In '04 & '05 he got the best faculty merit ranking at the EE dept, USC. He was a winner in the ACM MobiCom '07 SRC, finalist in '08 and '12 SRC research competitions and winner in ACM MobiCom WiNTech demo '10. In '13 he received the best paper award from ACM SIGSPATIAL IWCTS. In '14 he was a winner in several competitions by ACM MobiCom. In '15 he was a recipient of the best paper award from the Internet Technical Committee (ITC), in '17 the best poster award from IEEE INFOCOM, and in '18 the best in-session presentation from IEEE INFOCOM. He is a leader of several NSF funded projects: MARS, STRESS, ACQUIRE, Aware, and MobiBench. His research interests include design, analysis & measurement of wireless adhoc, sensor & mobile social networks, mobility modeling, multicast protocols, IP mobility & network simulation. He has published over 200 journal articles, conference papers and posters, book chapters & IETF RFCs/IDs. His research is (or has been) supported by grants from NSF, Intel, Cisco, DARPA, NASA, T-Labs, Nvidia, Nortel, HP, Pratt & Whitney, Siemens & Silicon Graphics. Dr. Helmy is an associate editor of the IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing (TMC) ('12-'17), area editor of the IEEE Computer ('10-'14), and the Adhoc Networks Journal - ElSevier ('04-'11).
