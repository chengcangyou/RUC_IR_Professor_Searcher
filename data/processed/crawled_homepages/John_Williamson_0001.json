This includes gesture recognition/motion sensor based interfaces, brain-computer interaction, and particularly developing new feedback mechanisms for such systems. I am currently a Lord Kelvin Fellow Sensors Fellow in the School of Computing Science. I previously worked on the EU TOBI project, looking at interaction design for EEG-based brain computer interfaces. I'm in the Inference, Dynamics and Interaction Group , and the GIST (HCI) group. I am interested in continuous-control based interfaces, and in the use and representation of ambiguity in interfaces. Particular topics of interest include interaction design with unusual sensors (such as EEG), novel selection techniques and realtime sonifications of interactions. Some of my recent work has been on the Motion Explorer project, which is developing systematic protocols to explore the input space of different joint user-sensor systems. The Shoogle system is an example of work which combines these threads; this displays information from mobile devices as they are shaken around -- content becomes objects which rattle around \"inside\" the device. My PhD thesis Continuous Uncertain Interaction discusses these issues in some depth. Resources Publications Multimodal Excitatory Interfaces with Automatic Content Classification J. Williamson and R.
