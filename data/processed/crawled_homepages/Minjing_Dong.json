Hong Kong Email DBLP Github Google Scholar ORCID I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong since January 2024. I received my Ph.D. and M.Phil degree from School of Computer Science, University of Sydney, supervised by Dr. Chang Xu. Before that, I received my BS degrees in Software Engineering and Information Technology from both Dalian University of Technology and University of Sydney. My research interests include trustworthy machine learning algorithms and their related applications in computer vision. Currently, my research focuses on: adversarial robustness, model calibration, efficient neural network, neural architecture search, generative model, and human motion analytics. 📯 Opening I am looking for self-motivated MPhil/PhD students enrolled in the year of 2026. If you are interested in trustworthy machine learning research, computer vision, generative models, adversarial robustness, model calibration, or efficient neural networks, feel free to send me an email (dong_serj[AT]hotmail[dot]com), with your CV, transcript, and publication. Successful PhD applicants will enroll in 2026 with scholarship. 📝 Publications ICCV 2025 VSSD: Vision Mamba with Non-Causal State Space Duality Yuheng Shi, Minjing Dong, Chang Xu International
