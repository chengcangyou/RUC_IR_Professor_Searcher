Office: CODA Building, Room E126 Email: piech at cs.stanford.edu Twitter: @chrispiech The Piech Lab I was born and grew up in Nairobi, Kenya. When I was twelve I moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia where I lived until I came to Stanford for university, liked it a lot and stayed. I love teaching and I'm into exploring our world (through both science and travelling). My research is in machine learning to understand human learning. News (Jan, 2025): Code in Place returns April 2025. CS106A online to 40k students with 4k volunteer TAs. The course in the world with the most teachers?! Best paper awards: The lab is humbled to have received best paper awards from SIGCSE'24, L@S'24, EDM'22, EDM'20, L@S'20 and AAAI'19 Best of STEM 2024 award for best use of AI for Teaching and Learning with Code.org. Awarded for \"AI teaching Assistant\".
