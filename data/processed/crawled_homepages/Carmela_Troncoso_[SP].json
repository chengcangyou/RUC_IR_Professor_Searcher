If you're an EPFL student looking for a Bachelor/MS/PhD semester project or an MS thesis, please refer to this page Work with me? If you are looking for a PhD or Postdoc, please refer to the open positions page. If there are not open positions at the time, but you want to work with me send an email with your research interests and background. Please ensure that your interests overlap with my research interests (take a look at my publications below). I promise I will read your email, but I do not always have the time to reply. Please do not take it personally, I receive many, many emails, and I cannot always reply them all. Who am I? I am an Associate Professor at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland. The Lab: I head the SPRING Lab focused on Security and Privacy Engineering at EPFL. Our work focuses on understanding and mitigating the impact of technology on society. Our research is spread along three lines: The intersection of Machine learning and Security & Privacy Development of Privacy Enhancing Technologies Privacy engineering You can read more about these topics in the lab's Research page. The Team: I currently supervise Boya Wang, Mathilde Raynal, Theresa Stadler, Saiid El Hajj Chehade Christian Knabenhans Eric Jolles and Klim Kireev. I also have the pleasure to collaborate with Ana Maria Cretu who is a postdoc at SPRING.. What I did before: Prior to EPFL, I have been a Faculty member at the IMDEA Software Institute in Madrid, Spain; the Security and Privacy Technical Lead Engineer at Gradiant, and a post doctoral researcher at the COSIC group. I got my PhD from KULeuven, advised by Prof. Bart Preneel and Prof. Claudia Diaz. Wanna know more? Here is my full CV. News May'24 SPRING lab has two papers at the ACM CCS 2024! May'24 SPRING lab presented three papers at this year's the IEEE Security and privacy symposium! Dec'23 First NeurIPS paper! Transferable Adversarial Robustness for Categorical Data Via Universal Robust Embeddings, with Klim Kireev, Maksym Andriushchenko, and Nicolas Flammarion. Very fruitful internal collaboration at EPFL! Jun-Sept'23 This summer we had a graduation stream! Bogdan, Kasra, Christian, Sinem, and Silvain got their PhDs and are off to continuing their academic life! Sep'23 I am co-chairing the 2nd IEEE Conference on Secure and Trustworthy Machine Learning with Nicolas Papernot. The event will take place in April 9-11 2024 Jul'23 I am the general chair, jointly with KÃ©vin Huguenin, of the 23rd Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium in Lausanne May'23 Our paper Not Yet Another Digital ID: Privacy-preserving Humanitarian Aid Distribution, a collaboration with the International Committee of the Red Cross, was selected for the Distinguished paper award at the IEEE Security and Privacy Symposium 2023!
