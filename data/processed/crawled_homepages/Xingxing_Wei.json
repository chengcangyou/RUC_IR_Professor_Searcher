From 2017 to 2019, I was a PostDoc in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University, working with Prof. Jun Zhu. Prior to this, I worked in Alibaba group, as a senior algorithm engineer. In July 2015, I obtained my PhD degree in School of Computer Science and Technology at Tianjin University, supervised by Prof. Xiaochun Cao. In July 2010, I received my bachelor degree in School of Automation and Electrical Engineering at Beihang University, supervised by Prof. Haibin Duan. From 2012 to 2015, I spent three happy years at Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, as a visiting student. News🎉 2025-08: One paper was accepted by IEEE TPAMI (CCF A)!
