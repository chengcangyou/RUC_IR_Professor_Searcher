For the time being: I DON'T GO TO CONFERENCES, I DON'T GIVE TALKS! Current exeptions: Linguistics conferences: I am still available for those Previously accepted engagements All other conference/lectures/seminars engagements are suspended indefinitely Something about myself \"A drifter of Dadaist persuasion\" (computational linguist, sometime physicist and occasional mathematician) Current Positions: Robert F.
