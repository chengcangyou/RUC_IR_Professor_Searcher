Previously, I held research positions at the University of California at Berkeley, advised by Umesh Vazirani, and in QuICS, at the University of Maryland/NIST. I received my Ph.D. in computer science in the Department of Computer and Mathematical Sciences and the Institute for Quantum Information and Matter at Caltech, co-advised by Alexei Kitaev and Chris Umans. My area of research is quantum computation. My research is in part supported by an Air Force Young Investigator Award from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research entitled “Characterizing the Power of Experimentally Feasible Quantum Computation with Applications to Rigorous Security Guarantees for Quantum-safe Cryptography” (Press release), a NSF CAREER award, entitled “Near-term quantum computing: achieving quantum advantage, and next steps”, as well as a Google Research award (2022). I am the program chair of TQC 2025, on the program committee of QIP 2026, QIP 2025, ITCS 2024, QIP 2023, TQC 2022, QCTIP 2022, QIP 2022, QIP 2021, TQC 2021, the chair of the IMSI Workshop on the Power of Near-term Quantum Experiments, chair of the NSF Workshop on Quantum Advantage and Next Steps, co-organizer of the Dagstuhl workshop Quantum Complexity: Theory and Application, co-organizer of the Simons Institute Summer Cluster on Quantum Computing 2023, and chair of the Simons Institute Workshop on Quantum Complexity, Spring 2024.",
