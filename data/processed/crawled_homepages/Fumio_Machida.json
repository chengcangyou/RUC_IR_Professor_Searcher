Overview Our society is increasingly relying on software systems, for example in business, economics, communication, utilities, and education. Since those software systems are indispensable for our lives, continuous engineering efforts to improve system dependability are imperatively important. Our research laboratory tackles this issue by leveraging stochastic models and analysis techniques. We model various uncertainties causing system misbehaviors such as component failures, estimate the system dependability quantitatively, and evaluate the effectiveness of the measures to improve the dependability with lower cost. Research interests Software reliability evaluation and design Stochastic models for dependability analysis (availability, reliability, performability) System dependability trade-off analysis and optimization Software rejuvenation and life-extension Dependability assurance for machine learning systems Dependable fog and edge computing LLM-based automated software engineering Details of research topics Recent topics 2025/11/21 New Our joint research paper entitled \"Machine Learning for Software Aging Detection: A Systematic Mapping Study\" has been accepted for publication in The Journal of Systems & Software. 2025/11/7 New Prof. Fumio Machida delivered an invited talk at IEICE Technical Committee on Information and Communication Management. \"N-version configuration method for reliable machine learning systems\" 2025/10/28 Yaqi Zhou joined our group as a visiting research student from Imperial College London. 2025/10/21 Prof. Fumio Machida delivered a keynote at the 2nd International Workshop on Advanced Intelligent Software Applications (AISQ 2025). \"High-Availability Machine Learning Systems: N-version Architecture and Rejuvenation\" [slides] 2025/10/20 Gabriel Grabher, a former exchange student's paper \"Modeling Anomaly Detection in Cloud Services: Analysis of the Properties that Impact Latency and Resource Consumption\" has been accepted for presentation at the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC 2025).
