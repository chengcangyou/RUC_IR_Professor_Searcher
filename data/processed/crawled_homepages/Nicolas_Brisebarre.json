Together with Guillaume Melquiond, I am in charge of the Pascaline team (its former name was Arénaire then AriC) located in the Laboratoire de l'Informatique du Parallélisme at the École Normale Supérieure de Lyon. My research deals with problems related to computer arithmetic (the aim is to improve the quality, the accuracy, the speed and the cost of computations on a machine). In this work, I like to use tools from algorithmic number theory, approximation theory, computer algebra and diophantine approximation.
