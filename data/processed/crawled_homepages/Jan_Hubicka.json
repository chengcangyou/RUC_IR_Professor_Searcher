My research interests include structural Ramsey theory, graph homomorphisms and homogeneous structures. I am long term contributor to GNU Compiler Collection where I have implemented original port to x86-64 and maintain inter-procedural optimizations, feedback directed optimizations and i386 port. I am also interested in history of photography and work on digitizing archive of Šechtl and Voseček studios. More details can be found in my CV (updated in September 2025).
