My research interests cover most aspects of visual computing and data mining, but especially in the frontiers among vision, image processing and models and theory of data mining from heterogeneous data sources. This includes shape and patterns detection, image features, image metrology, image-based tracking, 3D scanning, surface reconstruction, deep learning, and data embedding. My research interests also include geometric algebra (Clifford algebra in physics) and its applications. If you are interested in undergraduate and graduate studies in these areas, please send me some e-mail.

Book Álgebra Geométrica e Aplicações (in Portuguese) Sociedade Brasileira de Matemática Aplicada e Computacional (SBMAC) Notas em Matemática Aplicada, Volume 85, 2017 Leandro Augusto Frata Fernandes (IC-UFF) Carlile Lavor (IMECC-UNICAMP) Manuel Menezes de Oliveira Neto (INF-UFRGS) ISSN: 2175-3385, e-ISSN: 2236-5915 ISBN: 978-85-8215-081-8, e-ISBN: 978-85-8215-080-1 Winner of the Elon Lages Lima Award Geometric Algebra is a mathematical formalism which provides algebraic representations for geometric concepts. Recognized by the community of physicists as a very important mathematical tool, in the last decades Geometric Algebra has been introduced in other areas, such as engineering, visual computing and robotics. The beauty and power of Algebra Geometric are related to its capacity of unification, simplification, and generalization of various objects of mathematics involving geometrical concepts. For example, vectors, complex numbers, quaternions, tensors, and differential forms can all be seen in an integrated way within Geometric Algebra. It can also serve as a unique language for physicists, engineers, and computer scientists, making it easier to define and understand problems that arise in these areas. This book (written in Portuguese) is a product of the authors' involvement with the practical use of Geometric Algebra in their research.
