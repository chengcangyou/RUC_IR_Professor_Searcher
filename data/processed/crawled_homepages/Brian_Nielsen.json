My research interests include distributed, embedded, and cyber-physical systems and software, Internet-of-Things, robotics, and methods and tools for model-based development and test generation for embedded real-time systems, and industrial applications. I am involved in numerous European projects related to model-based testing and development, recently the industrially driven ENABLE-S3 (European Initiative to Enable Validation for Highly Automated Safe and Secure Systems). I am also a co-designer of the testing tool components of the Uppaal tool-suite for verification and validation of real-time systems.
