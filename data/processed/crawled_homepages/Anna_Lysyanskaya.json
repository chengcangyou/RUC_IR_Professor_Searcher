I am James A. and Julie N. Brown Professor of Computer Science at the Computer Science department at Brown University. My research area is Cryptography. Of particular importance in my research are privacy-enhancing technologies that allow individuals to go about their daily online lives without disclosing unnecessary personal data. I am most proud of my work on anonymous credentials and electronic cash. I am also interested in more broad and foundational cryptographic questions. If you are a prospective Ph.D. student interested in Cryptography, I encourage you to apply to the Brown CS department. Current Ph.D. students: Scott Griffy, Victor Youdom Kemmoe, Franklin Harding, Eileen Nolan. Current postdoctoral fellows: Eysa Lee, Jack Doerner.
