Very rarely gets updated, so apologies for decreasingly 'recent' recent events 😄. Do check out my publications page for recent and previous papers, and the PDL web pages for other interesting news and research. Some recent awards include 2021 OSDI Best Paper, 2021 SOSP Best Paper, 2021 SoCC Test of Time award, and a 2021 R&D 100 award. Everyone who thought 'Greg never takes a vacation' is wrong... it's less common than should be, but some fun ones include skiing in Vermont, hiking on Santa Cruz Island in Channel Islands National Park, and surfing in Hawaii (action shots provide proof)! Yes, still playing basketball and loving it. I have broad research interests in computer systems, including storage/file systems, cloud computing, software systems for large-scale machine learning, distributed systems, and operating systems. Most of my current research explores these topics in the broad context of storage systems and large-scale infrastructures within CMU's Parallel Data Lab (PDL), for which I serve as Director. See the PDL pages for more current information, since this page gets updated rately, but... Together with industry collaborators and other members of CMU's Parallel Data Lab (PDL) and CMU's CyLab, my students and I are currently pursuing several topics of research: Big Learning (Systems for ML) - The BigLearning project aims at scaling machine learning to large and sophisticated models and huge data for average machine learning practitioners by developing programmable, distributed computing frameworks. Caching to Improve Latency & Efficiency at Scale (CILES) - new designs that make both flash caching systems and content delivery caches more efficient, in terms of wear, tail latency, resiliency, cost-effectiveness, and of course hit rates. Cost-efficient Computing in the Cloud - explores opportunities to exploit the various CSP VM instance offerings (e.g., best-fit VM sizes or low-cost but unreliable VMs rented on transient contracts) to reduce the costs to run user applications in the cloud. Data Lake Scheduling - unearthing, analyzing, and exploiting hidden inter-job dependencies in data lakes (data analytics infrastructures) to better schedule jobs and manage resources. HeART (Disk-adaptive redundancy in distributed storage) - adaptive redundancy tuning to observed device failure rates in large distributed storage systems. Mimir: Navigating cloud storage - helpin users to make optimal decisions when composing distributed storage systems in the public cloud. Zoned Storage - exploring the system and software impacts of this new interface, which redefines the division of responsibilities between storage software and device firmware. Other recent projects include: NVM Redundancy - hardware and software approaches to providing memory-speed, storage-quality checksums and cross-chip parity. Self-* Storage Systems, which automate and simplify storage administration in clusters of self-configuring, self-organizing, self-tuning, self-healing, self-managing, etc. storage servers. Survivable distributed storage (PASIS) that provide data availability and security even after some successful breakins. Better Security via Smarter Devices. (which, among other things, includes self-securing storage devices that protect their contents from compromised OSes). Automated database storage management (Fates) that matches data layouts and access patterns to device-specific characteristics to increase performance and predictability. Characterization and simulation of storage systems. (Two useful side-effects of this work have been the publicly-available DiskSim storage system simulator and the DIXtrac-enabled database of validated disk parameters for it.) Design, implementation and use of Systems of Active Components, including \"intelligent\" NICs, Active Storage Networks, and Active Disks. Extracting and using free bandwidth from busy disks. MEMS-based storage devices in computer systems. I'm currently on a teaching cycle of teaching Storage Systems in Fall semesters and Advanced Cloud Computing in Spring semesters. I spent 8/95 thru 11/97 as a postdoc in Frans Kaashoek's research group (PDOS) at the MIT Lab for Computer Science. During that time, I participated in the design and development of the exokernel operating system. I also pursued (with others, of course) a number of specific projects, most of which are mentioned above. In a previous life (i.e., prior to August 1995), I was a graduate student in Yale Patt's research group in the University of Michigan's Advanced Computer Architecture Lab. Although the group's main focus is on compilation for and implementation of high-performance processors, my research was focused on file systems and storage subsystem architecture. I earned all of my collegiate degrees (B.S., 1991, M.S., 1993, Ph.D., 1995) from the University of Michigan. Design by TEMPLATED",
