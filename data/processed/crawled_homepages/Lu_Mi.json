I am looking for highly-motivated PhD students and interns to join Tsinghua University and Shanghai Qizhi Institute. Drop me an email if you are interested. Before joining Tsinghua, I was an Assistant Professor at Gatech CSE from 2024 to 2025 and a Shanahan Foundation Fellow at the Allen Institute for Brain Science and University of Washington from 2022 to 2024. Prior to that, I received my PhD degree in Computer Science from MIT CSAIL in 2022, advised by Prof. Nir Shavit. Concurrently, I was a fellow in the Harvard Center for Brain Science from 2020 to 2022. I received a bachelor’s degree from Tsinghua University. Email  / Google Scholar  / Twitter  / CV Research My research lies in the intersection of natural intelligence and artificial intelligence. I am working on accelerating scientific discovery in the brain in the Age of AI, and bridging the gap between artificial and biological neural networks. You could check my research summary here. My research is recognized with several honors, including the MathWorks Fellowship, Shanahan Foundation Fellowship, and an NIH award. I was selected as 2022 Rising Stars in EECS and our work has been featured in MIT News and Forbes. I am broadly interested in (1) AI for Neuroscience: Designing generalized methods (including foundation models) and scientific agents to accelerate data-driven discovery in neuroscience, understanding the mechanisms of coding, computation, and learning within biological neural networks. (2) Neuroscience for AI: Using the neuroscience’s perspectives (interpretability, representation, human-machine alignment) to understand AI frameworks, and using mechanisms such as sparsity, plasticity, diversity and modularity discovered in the brain to develop brain-inspired AI frameworks. (3) Brain-Computer Interface: Developing computational algorithms that decode brain signals into behaviors, images and languages.
