Shankar Sastry Professorship in Emerging Technologies. She received her BS and Meng degrees from MIT and her PhD from UC Berkeley all in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. She is currently Co-director of the Berkeley Wireless Research Center (BWRC), a Core Member of the Center for Neural Engineering and Prostheses (CNEP) and an Investigator at the Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub. Dr. Muller was previously an IC designer at Analog Devices, and was the co-founder of Cortera Neurotechnologies, Inc. (acq.), a medical device company focused on closed-loop deep brain stimulation technology. Her research group focuses on emerging implantable and wearable medical devices and in developing low-power, wireless microelectronic and integrated systems for neurological applications. She was named one of MIT Tech Reviewâs 35 global innovators under 35 (TR35) and Boston MedTechâs 40 healthcare innovators under 40. She is the recipient of the National Academy of Engineering Gilbreth Lectureship, the NSF CAREER Award, the Keysight Early Career Professorship, the McKnight Technological Innovations in Neuroscience Award, and the IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society New Frontier Award. She is a Bakar Fellow, a Hellman Fellow, and a Distinguished Lecturer for the Solid-State Circuits Society.
