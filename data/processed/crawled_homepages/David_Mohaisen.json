  "content": "David Mohaisen I am a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Central Florida, with joint appointments in Computer Engineering and Modeling and Simulation. My research is in the area of security and privacy, with a recent focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence, software and networked systems, Internet of Things and wearables, and blockchains. At UCF, I direct the SEAL research group, where I have been fortunate to mentor several excellent students. I obtained my Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota in 2012. I spent several years before and after my Ph.D. in the research and development industry, including working as a research engineer at ETRI in South Korea and as a (senior) research scientist at Verisign Labs.
