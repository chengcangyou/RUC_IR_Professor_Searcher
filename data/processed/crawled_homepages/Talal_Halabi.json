I have a PhD in Computer Engineering from Polytechnique Montréal (University of Montreal). I am currently leading several high-impact research projects in Cybersecurity. My research focuses on the security and resilience of large-scale networked systems and adopts a rigorous approach to strategic defense through the lens of Artificial Intelligence. My goal is to increase the tolerance of these systems to zero-day threats. I have published peer-reviewed research papers extensively and fostered intensive collaborations with several universities in Canada including McGill, Queen's, Calgary, and Polytechnique Montréal.  Check out my recent publications on Google Scholar.Prospective StudentsLooking for qualified PhD students interested in IoT systems and networks security. Funding available. Background in communication networks, computer security, or Artificial Intelligence is an asset.
