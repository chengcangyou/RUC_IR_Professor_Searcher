In 2000, he joined the master program at ETSIT-Universidad Politécnica de Madrid obtaining a Msc. in Networks and Telecommunication Systems in 2001. After completing his master, he moved to DISAM (ETSII) Universidad Politécnica de Madrid where he obtained his doctorate in Robotics and Automation. While completing his PhD he gained extensive experience with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and in particular Autonomous Helicopters investigating computer vision techniques for Guidance, Control and Navigation of UAVs.  He is currently an Associate Professor and Researcher at Queensland University of Technology.
