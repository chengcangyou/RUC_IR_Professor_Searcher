My research focuses on assistive technology for persons with visual impairments. Specifically, I am exploring the use of mobile computer vision, inertial sensors, and location-aware systems for increased spatial awareness and information access without sight. I hold a \"Dottorato di ricerca\" in Electrical Engineering from the University of Padova, Italy. Prior to joining UCSC in 2001, I worked at Apple and at NASA JPL. I serve on the scientific advisory board of Aira and am a board member of the Vista Center for the Blind and Visually Impaired. Please visit the sites of the UCSC Computer Vision Lab for information about my research group and our projects. You might also be interested in a review article and in a book, both of which focus on my area of research. PUBLICATIONS: Since 2002 - Before 2002",
