Phone: +49 (0)7071 29-70832 E-mail: ulrike.luxburg(at)uni-tuebingen.de I am a professor for computer science, with research focus on the theory of machine learning. Quick links / news: Publications I am looking for PhD students! If you are interested in theoretical foundations of explainable machine learning, and potentially their relationships to law or social science or ethics, then please apply via the Ellis Phd program or the IMPRS graduate school and select me as one of your potential supervisors. See also our Jobs page. @ulrikeluxburg.bsky.social Upcoming: Tübingen Conference for AI and Law, November 5/6 Ellis/EurIPS Workshop \"Theory of Explainable Machine Learning\", deadline for contributions is Oct 15. Research. My research focus is on theoretical questions about unsupervised machine learning: understanding implicit biases and assumptions of machine learning algorithms, giving formal guarantees to some algorithms, and proving how other algorithms systematically fail. In particular, we currently ask all these questions in the context of explainable machine learning. Publications Our research seminar Research questions I am coordinating the research cluster Machine learning: New Perspectives for Science (jointly with Philipp Berens), and the CZS Institute for AI and Law (together with Michele Finck and Stefan Thomas). Teaching For our current lectures and seminars, see our teaching page If you are considering to write your Bachelor / Master thesis in our group, please also check out our teaching page for how to proceed. Here are links to some of my free online lectures on youtube: Statistical Machine Learning (2020), Mathematics for Machine Learning (2020), Theoretische Informatik (2021, in German) Short CV, awards, community service: see here Public AI exhibition. Our exhibition \"Cyber and the City: Künstliche Intelligenz bewegt Tübingen\" in 2024 received the German Communicator Award, Germany's most prestigious award in science communication. The exhibition was conceptualized and created over the course of two years by two colleagues in cultural anthropology (Thomas Thiemeyer, Tim Schaffarczik), myself, the local city museum (Guido Szymanska and Wiebke Ratzeburg), and 36 master students of cultural anthropology and machine learning. The exhibition itself has closed already, butthe exhibition webpage by the students still exists. Consider watching my Kinderuni lecture on youtube: ``Warum ist künstlich Intelligenz nicht immer gerecht?'' (Why is AI not always fair?) Funding and transparency: see here.
