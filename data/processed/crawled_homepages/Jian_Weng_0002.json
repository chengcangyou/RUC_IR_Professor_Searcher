His research interests lie on full-stack computing systems' design and implementation, including but not limited to designing and analyzing accelerators, the accelerator-associated software-stacks as well as exploiting the potentials of existing devices. His works have been recognized with one IEEE Micro Top Picks Honorable Mentions, and one MICRO Best Paper Runner-up. Jian Weng earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from UCLA in 2023, advised by Prof. Tony Nowatzki. I will be actively looking for self-motivated and hard-working Ph.D. students interested in compiler infrastructures, RTL implementation, and architecture simulators. If you are interested, after reading my advertisement as well as a set of simple questions, feel free to send me your CV and research interests to [first-name].[last-name].hirephd -at- gmail.com.
