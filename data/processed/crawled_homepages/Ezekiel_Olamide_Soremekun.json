This includes SE research concerns such as automated debugging, software testing, program analysis, and security testing. He is interested in studying both functional properties (e.g., correctness) and non-functional properties (e.g., security, robustness, and fairness) of software systems, including artificial intelligence (AI) -driven systems (e.g., automated classifiers).Ezekiel’s research objective is to apply scientific methods to validate software systems. His main research goal is to address key challenges in software validation by developing methods and tools to support developers during software testing and debugging activities.The over-arching research aim is to provide useful validation techniques, tools and empirical studies for the following:Software Testing & Analysis: systematic analysis of programs and automated generation of test inputs to expose unexpected program behaviors (see ASE17, TSE20, TOSEM23),Automated Debugging: how to automatically diagnose, mitigate and repair incorrect program behaviors (see ICSE20, FSE20, ISSTA20, EMSE21, ISSRE25),Human Factors in SE: studying and accounting for developer behaviors during (automated) software testing and debugging activities (see ESEC/FSE17, ICSE23, CHI25), and AI4SE & SE4AI: application of SE techniques (e.g., testing and debugging) to address AI concerns and the application of AI methods to address SE tasks (see TSE22, MSR22, COSE23, JSS24, EMNLP24, CSUR25).",
