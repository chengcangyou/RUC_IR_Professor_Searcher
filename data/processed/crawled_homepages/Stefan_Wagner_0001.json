The Chair of Software Engineering conducts cutting-edge research in software engineering, focusing on software quality, human factors, AI-supported engineering, and empirical studies, especially for automotive and AI-based software domains. The research has high practical relevance, often in collaboration with companies, to improve how we make software.Prof Wagner studied computer science in Augsburg and Edinburgh and psychology in Hagen. He completed his doctorate in computer science at TUM in 2007. In 2011, he was appointed Professor of Empirical Software Engineering at the University of Stuttgart, where he was Dean of Studies and Speaker of the Artificial Intelligence Software Academy (AISA). In 2024, Prof Wagner was appointed Full Professor of Software Engineering at TUM.
