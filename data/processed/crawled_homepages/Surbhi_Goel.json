I am affiliated with the Theory group, the ASSET Center on safe, explainable, and trustworthy AI systems, and the Warren Center for network and data sciences. My research interests lie at the intersection of theoretical computer science and machine learning, with a focus on developing theoretical foundations for modern machine learning paradigms. Before joining Penn, I was a postdoc at Microsoft Research NYC in the Machine Learning group. I obtained my Ph.D. in the Computer Science department at the University of Texas at Austin where I was fortunate to be advised by Adam Klivans. During my PhD, I visited IAS at Princeton and the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at UC Berkeley. Prior to that, I received my Bachelors degree from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi. My research has been generously supported by a Schmidt Sciences AI2050 Early Career Fellowship, an Amazon Research Award, an OpenAI Superalignment Fast Grant, a Microsoft Accelerate Foundation Models Research Award, a NSF Medium Award, a challenge fund grant from UK's AI Security Institute (AISI), a JP Morgan AI PhD Fellowship, and a Simons-Berkeley Research Fellowship. My thesis won the Bert Kay Dissertation award by the Department of Computer Science at UT Austin.",
