We develop security/privacy mechanisms for emerging decentralized applications and decentralized alternatives to traditional systems, leveraging techniques from distributed computing, cryptography, protocol design, and new hardware capabilities. Decentralization is not our ultimate goal; rather, it is a guiding principle for building resilient systems that can thrive in dynamic, adversarial environments. SDSL is directed by Dr. Yang Xiao and receives funding support from NSF. Research Interests Decentralized systems — consensus protocol security and usability, decentralized identity and access management. Autonomous IoT — secure communication, security mechanisms for collaborative autonomy, distributed machine learning. Mobile networks — subscriber privacy and scam prevention, authentication, spectrum access management. News ◾  08/2025: Our collaborative NewSpectrum project has been awarded by the NSF.
