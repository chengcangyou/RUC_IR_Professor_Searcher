My research interests focus on cybersecurity, in particular automated cyber-physical systems security, malware analysis, as well as computer forensics. The best way to get hold of me is by e-mail: stefano.zanero@polimi.it. Should you ever need to send me sensitive data, please use my PGP key. You can reach me by phone at 4017 (+39 02 2399 4017 from outside), or in my office, first floor, room 118. But it's far easier to find me in my lab, the NECSTLab.
