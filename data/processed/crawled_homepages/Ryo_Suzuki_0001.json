Much like writing systems, the printing press, and painting canvases, they empower and amplify human thought and creativity. This medium, however, is currently confined within the boundaries of flat rectangular screens, restricting our minds and creative potential to what can be done in this small space. Our goal is to redesign this medium to unlock the full potential of human capabilities, by transforming our world itself into a computational medium with the power of AR and AI.PrinciplesBlendedShould Work with Real, Tangible Objects in the Real World, not Virtual Objects on Screens or in VRHumans have developed tangible and spatial abilities. Media should leverage these innate human capabilities, instead of requiring humans to adapt to media’s capabilities.DynamicShould Leverage Dynamic and Explorable Representations, not Static and Passive OnesHuman thought and creative process is fluid. Media should harness this dynamic and explorable potential, beyond merely watching and consuming static text or passive content.PervasiveShould Work with Every Single Space, Object, and Environment, On-the-Fly and On-DemandTangible user interfaces exist over decades, but only in research labs. It is time to make them accessible, adaptable, and deployable to everywhere for everyone with the power of AI.Umbrella ThemesAugmented LanguagesReinvent Languages for Spatial Computing EraWe redsign \"languages\", including written, spoken, and visual languages, to empower human-to-human communication― Dynamic Media for ―readingpresentingwritingcommunicatingExplorable EnvironmentsScience Museums for Every HomeWe transform our everyday space into explorable environments where people can learn through tangible exploration just like science museums.― Dynamic Media for ―learningunderstandingexploringdiscoveringGenerative ARMake the World a Dynamic Canvas for Generative AIWe unleash the creative potential of Generative AI beyond screens, as if the entire world becomes a dynamic and living canvas.― Dynamic Media for ―sketchingexpressingauthoringcreatingResponsive Physical WorldRespond Both Visually and PhysicallyBoth visual and physical representations are equally important.
