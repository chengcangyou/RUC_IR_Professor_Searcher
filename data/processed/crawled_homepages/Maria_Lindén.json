I am particularly working with design, implementation and evaluation of non-invasive sensor systems for registration of physiological parameters as ECG, motion analysis, and blood flow measurements. This also includes signal processing. One of the driving forces for me is to find solutions to real problems, which prerequisites direct contact and dialog with the intended end-users of the systems. I am the leader of the research profile Embedded Sensor Systems for Health (ESS-H).
