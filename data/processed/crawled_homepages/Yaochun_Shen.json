About I received my PhD from Nanjing University in 1992. After holding various positions at Southeast University, Heidelberg University, Heriot-Watt University, Cambridge University, and TeraView Ltd (Cambridge, UK), I joined the University of Liverpool in 2007 and became a full Professor in 2016. My research focuses on the development of novel imaging technologies, including terahertz (THz) imaging and optical coherence tomography (OCT), for practical applications. Both OCT and THz imaging technologies have the capability of imaging not only surface features but also the internal structures of a sample. Some of the application highlights I have developed include the mapping and identification of explosives, off-line inspection of pharmaceutical and automobile coatings, and a THz in-line sensor for real-time intelligent process monitoring and control. My recent research highlights include the development of high-speed, ultrahigh-resolution OCT for the diagnosis of eye diseases and systemic disorders. If you are interested in commercialising our imaging technologies, or joining my group to work on these research topics or pursue your own ideas, please contact me (e-mail: ycshen@liverpool.ac.uk; mobile: 07954391635; WeChat: ycshen888) to discuss opportunities around.",
