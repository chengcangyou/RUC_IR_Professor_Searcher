Computing Science, 1993, University of Alberta Thesis:  Parallel Search of Narrow Game Trees B.Sc. Honours, Computing Science, 1991, University of Alberta Research Interests High-Performance Computing, Cloud Computing, Machine Learning in Software Systems I am interested in all aspects of high-performance computing, but especially parallel and distributed systems, and cloud computing. My research program centers on systems software (OS, VMs, parallel programming) and, most recently, high-performance data transfers and IaaS cloud computing. In the past few years, I have used machine learning (ML) to classify the network protocols in use, to support performance optimizations.",
