Although the technology was formally introduced with the publication of the IEEE 802.11ax amendment in May 2021, the first commercially available products had already appeared in 2018, and since then millions of access points and client devices have been sold. Still, researchers lack a practical way to observe the OFDMA-based multi-user frame exchanges in the wild. We close this gap by designing and implementing the first open-source complete toolkit that captures every downlink frame of an 802.11ax OFDMA network using only commodity hardware augmented with lightweight firmware patches. An extensive experimental campaign across diverse access points quantifies capture and timing accuracy, error rates, and reveals scheduler behaviors that are opaque to conventional sniffers. By exposing both the capabilities and the limits of COTS-based monitoring, our work provides a foundation for future research on next-generation Wi-Fi MAC protocols and performance tuning. 2025 18th ACM Conference on Security and Privacy in Wireless and Mobile Networks Conference DEMO: Illuminating the BlindSpot: Efficient Single-Node Selective Jamming for LoRaWAN Vincenz Mechler Frank Hessel Matthias Hollick Bastian Bloessl PDF BibTeX DOI: 10.1145/3734477.3736153 Abstract LoRaWAN has become a widely adopted, cost-effective solution for Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs), bridging the gap between short-range wireless protocols and high-power cellular networks. Its affordable hardware and robust physical layer make it a key enabler for Internet of Things (IoT) applications across sectors like agriculture, smart cities, and industrial automation-domains where security is of central importance. Investigating LoRaWAN's resilience against physical-layer attacks, we developed BlindSpot, a novel jamming attack targeting state-of-the-art LoRaWAN gateways. Unlike traditional jammers, BlindSpot does not rely on overpowering transmissions but prevents their reception by exhausting resources at the gateway. This is possible since commercial gateway processors have only a limited number of demodulators for parallel frame reception. In this demo, we show the effectiveness of the attack against a commercial LoRaWAN gateway, compare it to traditional jamming, and show how our Software-Defined Radio (SDR)-based receiver can overcome the attack. 2025 18th ACM Conference on Security and Privacy in Wireless and Mobile Networks Conference BlindSpot: Efficient Single-Node Selective Jamming for LoRaWAN Vincenz Mechler Frank Hessel Matthias Hollick Bastian Bloessl PDF BibTeX DOI: 10.1145/3734477.3734724 Abstract LoRaWAN has become a widely adopted, cost-effective solution for Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs), bridging the gap between short-range wireless protocols and high-power cellular networks. Its affordable hardware and robust physical layer make it a key enabler for Internet of Things (IoT) applications across sectors like agriculture, smart cities, and industrial automation-domains where security is of central importance. In this paper, we present BlindSpot, a novel jamming attack that enables efficient selective jamming of LoRaWAN gateways. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on creating high-power interference, BlindSpot exploits the limited number of demodulation paths in LoRaWAN gateways to continuously occupy the gateways with fabricated frames, blinding them for any other legitimate transmissions. Compared to existing approaches, this reduces the attacker's power requirements and allows them to decode the legitimate transmissions with a high probability. Selectively retransmitting these frames, the attacker has precise control over which transmissions can be decoded by the gateway. Using a Software-Defined Radio (SDR)-based LoRa transceiver, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack against commercial LoRaWAN gateways and propose detection and mitigation strategies to improve the security of LoRaWAN deployments. 2025 2025 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI'25) Conference The User Perspective on Island-Ready 6G Communication: A Survey of Future Smartphone Usage in Crisis-Struck Areas with Local Cellular Connectivity Leon Janzen Florentin Putz Marc-AndrÃ© Kaufhold Kolja Straub Matthias Hollick BibTeX DOI: 10.1145/3706598.3714324 2025 Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium 2025 Conference Starshields for iOS: Navigating the Security Cosmos in Satellite Communication Jiska Classen Alexander Heinrich Fabian Portner Felix Rohrbach Matthias Hollick PDF BibTeX DOI: 10.14722/ndss.2025.240124 Abstract Apple has integrated satellite communication into their latest iPhones, enabling emergency communication, road- side assistance, location sharing with friends, iMessage, and SMS. This technology allows communication when other wireless services are unavailable. However, the use of satellites poses restrictions on bandwidth and delay, making it difficult to use modern communication protocols with their security and privacy guarantees. To overcome these challenges, Apple designed and implemented a proprietary satellite communication protocol to address these limitations. We are the first to successfully reverse-engineer this protocol and analyze its security and privacy properties. In addition, we develop a simulation-based testbed for testing emergency services without causing emergency calls. Our tests reveal protocol and infrastructure design issues. For example, compact protocol messages come at the cost of missing integrity protection and require an internet-based setup phase. We further demonstrate various restriction bypasses, such as misusing location sharing to send arbitrary text messages on old iOS versions, and sending iMessages over satellite from region-locked countries. These bypasses allow us to overcome censorship and operator control of text messaging services. 2024 IEEE Conference on Network Function Virtualization and Software Defined Networks (NFV-SDN) Conference State-aware Subscriber Steering in Fiber Access Networks for Improved Resilience Fridolin Siegmund Philip Jonas Franz Bjoern Nagel Maik RÃ¼der Lisa Wernet Matthias Hollick Ralf Kundel PDF BibTeX DOI: 10.1109/NFV-SDN61811.2024.10807483 Abstract Network softwarization is currently emerging in home and enterprise Internet access networks. Still, the advantages of programmable hardware nodes and virtualized network functions in the access network as resilience enablers should be researched more. Access networks are typically built in a two-layer tree topology with sparse redundancy and limited adaptability. To overcome this, this work investigates how softwarization with redundancy can achieve resilience improvements in such networks. We present an architecture and prototypical implementation of a fiber-based access network and subscriber termination, with a redundant and adaptive design throughout the whole path from subscribers to the Internet. By proactively migrating states and steering subscriber flows, we reached total average downtimes of around 156 milliseconds to restore Internet access after disruption in the case of one subscriber. In comparison, it takes hours to restore Internet access in case of an outage with zero redundancy. Our solution is cost-effective by exploiting the architectural advances of Software Defined Networking, allowing the use of virtualized network functions and hardware-based functions simultaneously. 2024 18th ACM Workshop on Wireless Network Testbeds, Experimental evaluation & Characterization 2024 Conference Beyond Sensing: A High-Performance Software-Defined LoRa Gateway Vincenz Mechler Matthias Hollick Bastian Bl",
