Research Dr Labrosse's research interests focus on robotics and image processing/machine vision for robotics, specifically in the area of autonomous, off-road, navigation.  This includes autonomous driving on ill-defined \"roads\", cross-field navigation and topological mapping and planning.  Dr Labrosse collaborates with a variety of \"customers\" having real problems to solve in the real world.  This includes archaeologists, biologists and geographers.  For these applications, Dr Labrosse uses a variety of robots ranging from large wheeled robots to multi-copters and fixed wing air frames.  Many of these robots have been designed and built in the Computer Science department for specific applications and general research.
