I joined URI in 2015 after completing a postdoctoral appointment in the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at the University of Delaware. I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Utah State University, an M.S. in Computer Science from the Instituto de CiÃªncias MatemÃ¡ticas e de ComputaÃ§Ã£o at the Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo, and a B.S. in Computer Science from the Faculdade de ComputaÃ§Ã£o at the Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul. Research Interests My research focuses on Artificial Intelligence, with particular emphasis on developing innovative approaches and applying Deep Learning to source code and computer programs. I am interested in the convergence of AI, programming languages, and compilers to create novel solutions for understanding, optimizing, and analyzing software at different levels of abstraction. Additionally, through collaborations, I have developed competence and a strong interest in applying machine learning and AI to solve problems in computer vision and computational biology.
