My research is connected to formal verification and synthesis, including the efficient solving of parity games, using binary decision diagrams in formal methods and SAT/SMT solving with multi-core parallelism. I like making and improving usable research tools. My PhD thesis was on parallelizing decision diagram algorithms. I implemented the Sylvan multi-core decision diagram package, which supports binary decision diagrams and multi-way (list) decision diagrams with custom leaves (booleans, integers, rational functions, etc), that is, binary and multi-way algebraic decision diagrams. The package is used in several applications, including the model checkers LTSmin, Storm and IscasMC, as well as the symbolic bisimulation minimisation tool SigrefMC. After my PhD, I worked as a Postdoc in the Formal Models and Verification group of Armin Biere, where I mostly studied parity games. I implemented the Oink parity game solver as a platform for studying different parity game algorithms and with the additional objective of practical performance. Oink is now the state-of-the-art in practical parity game solving. I also implemented the synthesis tool Knor for the SYNTCOMP competition, which accepts as input a parity automaton in the HOA specification language, and constructs as output a Mealy controller as an and-inverter-graph in the AIGER format. I continue designing algorithms that solve parity games. Hopefully one of these runs in polynomial time. My algorithms mostly use the tangle attractor to partition a parity game and its subgames into smaller regions, learning new tangles until winning regions are found. My Research Tools Sylvan â A multi-core implementation of decision diagrams. Lace â Work-stealing framework in C, similar to Cilk. SigrefMC â Symbolic bisimulation minimisation for LTS, CTMC and IMC systems. Oink â Library/implementation of various parity game algorithms. Knor - Reactive controller synthesis from parity automaton (HOA format) to controller (AIGER format).
