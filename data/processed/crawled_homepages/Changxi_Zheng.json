I joined the faculty of Computer Science Department after I received my PhD from Cornell University. Now I am directing Columbia's Computer Graphics Group (C2G2) in Columbia Vision and Graphics Center (CVGC). I work on applied computer science, with a particular focus on computer graphics and scientific computing in general. Research Overview Along with my students and collaborators, I develop numerical models for simulating various physical phenomena that involve complex motions such as fluids, bubbles, thin rods, and their resulting acoustic waves. Leveraging the computational insights developed in these models, I also devise methods in a range of applications including improving the process of making tangible objects and enrich them with novel new functionalities, enabling unprecedented human-computer interactions, and developing software tools for making acoustic and photonic devices. I am actively looking for self-motivated students, especially the students with strong Math/CS background. If you are at Columbia, feel free to come to talk to me. If you are interested but not at Columbia, please consider applying our PhD program. selected publications NeurIPS 2020 SIGGRAPH Asia 2019 SIGGRAPH 2019 NeurIPS 2018 >> More current teaching Spring 2025 COMS W4167 Computer Animation Loading ......
