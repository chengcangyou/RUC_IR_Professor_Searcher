I also work part-time as a Distinguished Scientist at Google DeepMind. My research areas include computer vision and deep learning. I am best known for my work on Deep Residual Networks (ResNets), which is the most-cited paper of the twenty-first century, according to a Nature article. The proposed residual connections are now being used everywhere in modern deep learning models, including Transformers (e.g., ChatGPT), AlphaGo Zero, AlphaFold, and virtually all GenAI models today, among many others. I am also known for my work on visual perception (e.g., Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN) and self-supervised learning (e.g., MoCo, MAE). My publications have over 700,000 citations (as of May 2025). I am a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Test of Time Award in NeurIPS 2025, ICCV 2025, the PAMI Young Researcher Award in 2018, the Best Paper Award in ICCV 2017, CVPR 2016, CVPR 2009, the Best Student Paper Award in ICCV 2017, the Best Paper Honorable Mention in CVPR 2021, ECCV 2018, and the Everingham Prize in ICCV 2021. Before joining MIT in 2024, I was a research scientist at Facebook AI Research (FAIR) from 2016 to 2024, and a researcher at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) from 2011 to 2016. I received my PhD degree from the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2011, and my B.S. degree from Tsinghua University in 2007. Prospective PhD students: if you are interested in joining my group as a PhD, please submit your application to the EECS admission process (opening Sept.) and tag my name in the system. Prospective interns and post-docs: if you are interested in joining my group, please email me with your CV and a short research statement.
