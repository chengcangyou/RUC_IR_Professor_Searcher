The 2024-2025 Multicore Semantics and Programming (L304) Part III/ACS module and Part II Unit (with Tim Harris and Christopher Pulte) [slides] [notes] ...previous teaching Research My research aims to put the engineering of real-world computer systems on better foundations, developing techniques (both mathematically rigorous and pragmatically useful) to make systems that are better-understood, more robust, and more secure. This applied semantics needs tightly integrated theoretical and practical research, spanning a range of Computer Science: architecture specification, programming languages, verification, security, and networking; developing and using techniques from semantics, type systems, automated reasoning, and concurrency theory. Our REMS group (Rigorous Engineering for Mainstream Systems) does this, in collaboration with many academic colleagues in Cambridge and elsewhere, and industry colleagues in Arm, Google, IBM, RISC-V International, and elsewhere. REMS was originally funded by the eponymous EPSRC REMS Programme Grant, with Imperial and Edinburgh; it continues with other funding, including the EU ERC AdG ELVER (2018-2024), the ERC/UKRI Frontier Guarantee AdG SAFER (2024-2029), and donations from Arm, Google, Intel, and Amazon. The CHERI project, led by Robert Watson, Simon Moore, and myself at Cambridge, and Peter Neumann at SRI International, extends conventional hardware Instruction-Set Architectures (ISAs) with new architectural features to enable fine-grained memory protection and highly scalable software compartmentalization. It is a hardware/software/semantics co-design project, involving architecture design, hardware implementation, system software adaption, and formal semantics and mechanised proof of security properties. The UKRI Digital Security by Design Challenge, with £70m government and £117m industry funding from 2019-2025, developed the industrial prototype Arm Morello CHERI-ARM 64-bit CPU, SoC, board, and software stack, to evaluate and demonstrate the mass-market industrial feasibility of CHERI.
