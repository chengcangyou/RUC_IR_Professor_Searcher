Before joining  UM, I was an assistant professor at Mississippi State University. My research focuses on: software engineering, security, and machine learning. My goal is to build fundamental knowledge and algorithms to improve developers' productivity (e.g., code generation/recommendation, bug fixing) and ensure software quality (e.g., vulnerability detection and bug localization) effectively and efficiently. My research interests cover:Large language model with and for software engineeringSoftware securityCode generation and searchData-driven software engineeringAIOps & DevOpsI am serving PC on following high-quality conferneces. Please consider submitting your work to them.ASE'25, FSE'26,  MSR'26To prospective graduate students:  I am only accepting PhD students at this moment. For a PhD admission at University of Manitoba, you would need to have master’s completed or you would need to be in the process of completion of your master’s degree. News[8/2025][paper] Our paper \"VulScribeR: Exploring RAG-based Vulnerability Augmentation with LLMs\" was accepted by TOSEM.
