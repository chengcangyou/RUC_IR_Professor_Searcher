Morales joined IMDEA Software as a postdoctoral researcher in November 2010, after receiving his Ph.D degree in Computer Science from the Technical University of Madrid (UPM), Spain. Previously, he held a teaching assistant position at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid, starting in 2005. Jose’s work to date has focused on mechanisms for the efficient execution of logic programs: inference of program properties by abstract interpretation, highly-optimizing translation to low-level code using those properties, and the development of abstractions for the specification and automated construction of abstract machines. Research Interests Constraint logic programming, assertion languages, abstract interpretation, program analysis and transformations, compiler optimizations, multiparadigm language design and implementation, abstract machines, native code generation.
