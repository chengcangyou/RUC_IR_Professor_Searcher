  "content": "Norbert Zeh I am a Professor in the Faculty of Computer Science of Dalhousie University. I joined Dalhousie in 2003, after being a postdoc in the Department of Computer Science of Duke University. I received my Master’s degree in Computer Science in 1998 from Friedrich-Schiller-Universität in Jena, and my PhD in Computer Science in 2002 from Carleton University. From 2007 until 2017, I held a Tier II Canada Research Chair in Algorithms for Memory Hierarchies. My active research is in algorithms and data structures, primarily on NP-hard problems in bioinformatics. In my spare time, I enjoy riding my bike, hiking, camping, reading, teaching outdoor skills to the cub scouts in my scouts group, cooking with my boys, programming, and playing video games. The trick to earn an easy A+ in my classes is to tell me your favourite Insomnium song (just kidding about the grade; you’ll have to work for it).",
