He leads the ExpoLab Research Group with the aim to pioneer a resilient data platform at scale, a distributed ledger centered around a democratic and decentralized computational model (Blockchain Textbook, Consensus Textbook, Apache ResilientDB (Incubating), Journey, Outlook/Slides, Talk/Slides, Bitcoin Radio, Code, Hands-on, Wiki) that further aims to unify secure transactional and real-time analytical processing (Transaction Textbook, L-Store, QueCC). We envision ResilientDB to serve as a platform to foster “creativity”.  He has co-founded a blockchain company called Moka Blox, a spin-off of our ResilientDB Fabric. Comments are closed.
