Her interests lie in the intersection between Information Visualization, Behavioral Decision Making, and HCI. Her research on uncertainty communication explores how to align data visualizations of future events with human decision-making capabilities. She has received numerous honors, including the IEEE VGTC Significant New Researcher Award, an NSF CAREER Award, a Best Paper Award at IEEE VIS, multiple honorable mentions [1, 2], and the APA Early Career Award. She is the PI and Co-PI on several other grants funded by NSF (#2122174, #2028374, #1810498, #2400471), NIH (#1R01AI188576-01), and DOE.
