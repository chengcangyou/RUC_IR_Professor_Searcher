It is motivated by a belief that we are at the beginning of a paradigm shift in thinking about representational media, one that is starting to appreciate the importance of representations that are not only dynamic and interactive but also adapt to the structure of tasks, the history and context of activities, and our relationships with others. My goal is to better understand the cognitive, computational, and social ecology of dynamic interactive adaptive systems. My interests span across cognitive design, distributed and embodied cognition, human-computer interaction, multiscale information visualization, multimodal interaction, cognitive ethnography, and software tools for design and visualization. My work involves four intertwined activities: developing theory and methods, designing representations, implementing prototypes, and evaluating their effectiveness to better understand the broader design space in which they are situated. Current research is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and Microsoft Research. Recently completed research has been funded by California's Digital Media Innovation Program, Chancellor's Interdisciplinary Collaboratories Program, Darpa, Intel, Microsoft, Nissan, NSF, Sony, Toyota, and the UC MICRO Program.
