I am interested in Socially Aware NLP, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Human-AI Interaction, with a focus on how LLMs can augment human capabilities across research, work and well-being. My research goal is to design human-centered AI systems that are not only technically capable, but also meaningfully connected to how people think, interact, and collaborate. Prospective students and postdocs, please check out this page on how to get involved.
