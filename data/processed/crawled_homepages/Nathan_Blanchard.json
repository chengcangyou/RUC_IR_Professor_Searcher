The lab website has details our projects and publications.In my work, I pursue four major goals: 1) designing and building models that perceive the world with consistency, a requirement for generalized artificial intelligence to operate predictably; 2) evaluating how to best measure generalization potential across different modalities; 3) studying how biological and psychological knowledge can improve model design; and 4) designing and training machine learning models with real-world applicability. In my research, I have utilized data modalities such as vision, acoustic, and text, and I have a background in various other research domains, such as classroom education and sentiment analysis.If any of this sounds like research you would be interested in pursuing as a partner or a student, please contact me over email. Email: nathaniel.blanchard@colostate.edu Google ScholarThe IMPACT LabCheck out the IMPACT Lab website! Google SitesReport abuseGoogle SitesReport abuse",
