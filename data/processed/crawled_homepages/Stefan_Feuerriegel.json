He holds a dual affiliation as a full professor at LMU Munich School of Management and the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics, and Statistics at LMU Munich. In 2024, he visited the Stanford University in the USA as a Visiting Scholar. In 2025, he was a visiting scholar at the Cambridge Centre for AI in Medicine (CCAIM) at the University of Cambridge.Previously, Stefan was an assistant professor at ETH Zurich. He gaduated in 2015 with a Ph.D. at the Chair for InÂ­formÂ­aÂ­tion SysÂ­tems ReÂ­search (Prof. Dr. Dirk NeuÂ­mann), UniÂ­verÂ­sity of Freiburg. DurÂ­ing his reÂ­search stays, he partnered with reÂ­searchÂ­ers from the UniÂ­verÂ­sity of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney, the NaÂ­tional InÂ­stiÂ­tute of InÂ­formÂ­atÂ­ics (NII), Tokyo, McÂ­Combs School of BusiÂ­ness at the UniÂ­verÂ­sity of Texas at AusÂ­tin, and CarneÂ­gie MelÂ­lon UniÂ­verÂ­sity (CMU), PittÂ­sÂ­burgh.

Achievements Stefan has co-auÂ­thored 70+ journal artÂ­icles and 80+ peer-reÂ­viewed conÂ­ferÂ­ence paÂ­pers. These works have apÂ­peared in top outÂ­lets from genÂ­eral sciÂ­ence (e.g. Nature, PNAS), manÂ­ageÂ­ment (e.g ManÂ­ageÂ­ment SciÂ­ence, MarÂ­ketÂ­ing SciÂ­ence) and machine learning (e.g. NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, WWW, KDD, ACL, EMNLP, AAAI). AcÂ­cordÂ­ing to Google Scholar, his works count 10,000+ citaÂ­tions. Stefan currently serves as methodological expert for the Academy of Management Journal (AMJ).His group is supÂ­porÂ­ted by variÂ­ous comÂ­panÂ­ies (e.g. Google, MiÂ­crosoft, OrÂ­acle, Nvidia, Amazon) and mulÂ­tiple grants, for which the fundÂ­ing volume totals to more than EUR 5.5 milÂ­lion. In particular, he received an SNSF Eccellenza Grant, which is the equivalent in Switzerland to the ERC Starting Grant. Impact In the Media Read more Stefanâs reÂ­search is driven by the deÂ­sire to make a disÂ­tinctÂ­ive imÂ­pact in pracÂ­tice. For this, Stefan was adÂ­vising SDG FinÂ­anÂ­cing Lab of the OrÂ­ganÂ­isaÂ­tion for EcoÂ­nomic Co-opÂ­erÂ­aÂ­tion and DeÂ­velÂ­opÂ­ment (OECD) and organized workshops with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). He was a memÂ­ber of a COVID-19 WorkÂ­ing Group of the World Health OrÂ­ganÂ­izÂ­aÂ­tion (WHO) and an agenda conÂ­tribÂ­utor of the World EcoÂ­nomic Forum (WEF). Stefanâs research further led to the founding of 3 spin-offs: TonalityTech, BLP Digital, and ethonAI. up What are you looking for?
