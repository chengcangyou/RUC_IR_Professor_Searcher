Research Groups Systems Research, construed broadly Interests The use of parallel computing is increasing with the growing demand for compute cycles and availability of high networks and inexpensive powerful commodity processors. As the use of parallel computing increases there is a growing need for system software that can deliver the hardware performance to the application and tools to help programmers design, construct and maintain parallel applications. The focus of my research is parallel computation on machines and systems where processes communicate by passing messages. I am interested in the use of message-passing libraries like MPI (Message Passing Interface) and PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine). Interests include the performance of libraries, tools to aid programmers in developing programs, and design of message-passing applications to effectively use parallelism. Specific details about my research and current projects can be found in my homepage.
