I study how powerful actors that include corporations, governments, and coordinated networks shape information online. We develop methods that detect manipulation, explain risks to users, and enable protective action. Our goal is to shift power back to users by strengthening autonomy, privacy, and security at scale. At CaSPR, we: Build and evaluate secure, privacy-preserving systems Combine AI, applied cryptography, systems engineering, and user studies Detect and audit manipulative information flows at platform scale Translate research into practical defenses that restore user control Recent Publications [ACM CSCW] Cooperative Dynamics of Censorship, Misinformation, and Influence Operations: Insights from the Global South and U.S. Zaid Hakami, Yuzhou Feng, Bogdan Carbunar.
