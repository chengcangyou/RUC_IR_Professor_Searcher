See also The absurdity of death estimates from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) My current research involves high-stakes information retrieval, in which demonstrating the reliability and thoroughness of retrieval methods is of primary importance. A specific instance of high-stakes information retrieval is technology-assisted review (TAR) for electronic discovery in legal matters. My past research has involved programming languages, compilers, data structures, concurrency, and distributed computing. Here is a list of my publications. I'm a member of the program committee for the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC), coordinator of the TREC Total Recall Track, past coordinator of the TREC Legal Track and Spam Track. For twelve years I was coach of Waterloo's ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest team, qualifying for the World Finals every year, winning one World Championship, and two North American Championships. For six years I served as a member of the International Scientific Committee of The International Olympiad for Informatics, and served as Scientific Director when Canada hosted IOI '2010 in Waterloo.",
