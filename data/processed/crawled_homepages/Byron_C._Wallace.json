I'm the Sy and Laurie Sternberg Interdisciplinary Associate Professor at Northeastern University in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences. I work on NLP/ML + health. I am currently the Associate Dean for Research, and I am the Director of our BS in Data Science program. My office is 2208 177 Huntington. Research overview My research is in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, with an emphasis on applications in health. Working in the domain of health naturally motivates the methodological problems that I have worked on. For example, these include: model interpretability; learning with limited supervision from diverse sources; human-in-the-loop/hybrid systems; and trustworthiness of model outputs. For more details, see recent publications here. On the applications side, one thread of my research concerns developing language technologies to automate (or semi-automate) biomedical evidence synthesis. Here is an episode of the NLP highlights podcast in which I discuss this work, here is a (brief) talk I gave at SciNLP 2020, and here is an article written for a lay audience about the effort. Elsewhere, I have worked on models for processing notes in Electronic Health Records. A random sample of recentish publications Chantal Shaib, Millicent Liaw Li, Sebastian A.
