I’m also currently a Senior Visiting Faculty Researcher at Google Research. I work with other HCI faculty in the GroupLens lab. Our group build and develop human-centered AI (HCAI) for mental health and well-being in online interactions. HCAI (or human-centered ML) deliberately balances CS contributions with the needs and values of humans, communities, and stakeholders. This area is rich with use-inspired problems that lead us to improved AI infrastructure for user behavior modeling/prediction, such as measurement, multimodal feature engineering, and developing accurate and robust models with small datasets. However, I also think (and do) a lot about how peoples’ preferences and concerns about AI can inform this design process and intervention strategies. Finally, I critically evaluate these AI systems to develop more ethical research practices and policy for ML and computer science. My domain of interest is online social interaction (broadly) and mental health, with special interests in destructive behaviors like severe eating disorders, opioid use disorder and recovery, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. I’m broadly interested in topics adjacent to online interactions and mental health, like moderation and community governance, ethics of research in online communities, and AI for social good. RIght now, me and my students focus on two areas: 1) AI systems for social media as it impacts mental health, like content recommendation systems; and 2) LLM-powered chatbots that impact user mental health, cognitive capacity, and well-being. I received my Ph.D. in Human Centered Computing at Georgia Tech with Munmun De Choudhury, and did a postdoc at Northwestern University, working with Darren Gergle. My work has generously been supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), Northwestern’s Center for Advancing Safety of Machine Intelligence (CASMI), Cisco Research, Google, and an Amazon Research Award.

Great new papers from Leah Ajmani in FAccT on ethic practices in social media. Three papers at CSCW – mine on contextual gaps that manifest in ML models for mental health prediction, Leah Ajmani’s work on how Wikipedia page protection plays out in practice, and Mo Houtti’s interview study about workplace bias in VC. And congratulations to Mo, for the Best Paper Honorable Mention and Impact Recognition from CSCW. And thanks to new funding source National Science Foundation and an extended collaboration with Cisco! 4/12/23: New paper for CHI 2023 with PhD student Ashlee Milton about TikTok & mental health, and CSCW 2023 preprint up about our work in video conference and bias with PhD student Mo Houtti. More pre-prints to come soon… I was also on MPR (Minnesota NPR) to discuss social media and mental health. This was super fun to do! Also welcome Dan to upgrade from MS to PhD! Gracious thank you to new funding sources for my group: Amazon Research Awards and Northwestern CASMI! 9/29/22: It’s been a busy few months for me and my students. Hanlin Li published two papers (link to the first and second) about measuring and making more visible moderator labor in Reddit communities at ICWSM, one of which won a Best Paper Honorable Mention award. Yay! Ashlee also published her first workshop paper on the harms of content recommendations for mental health. Also take a look at this new paper about practices for human-centered machine learning, which is forthcoming in the Communications of the ACM (CACM). Two new PhD students have joined my group! Welcome Ava and Nuredin! Also gracious thank you to new funding sources for my group: Cisco Research and Google! 3/30/22: Added a section about Advising and to my students to this website! Also included a link to our new JMIR MH paper about annotation for suicidal ideation in Reddit communities! 4/5/21: Hey, good press vibes! I was interviewed on the TWIML podcast, appeared in a CACM News Article, and our work on data leverage got picked up by Fortune and MIT Tech Review. 1/4/21: New paper about data leverage has been accepted to FAccT 2021, led by Nick Vincent. arXiv link of the pre-print is up on Pubs page. I also start this month at the University of Minnesota 🙂 9/23/2020: New paper was accepted to New Media & Society, with lead author Joseph Seering. The pre-print is up on my Publications page. 4/24/2020: Accepted a job offer, and will start as a professor at the University of Minnesota. Wooohooo! 3/31/2020: New paper out from my dissertation research in Nature Partner Journal – Digital Medicine! Link here to the OA paper and the blog post 1/31/2020: Just saw our work on alternative therapies and opioid use disorder was covered by the Atlantic! How cool. 10/6/19: Our recent CSCW paper on human-centered machine learning was awarded a Best Paper Honorable Mention award! 9/13/19: Started my position at Northwestern CS earlier this month. My paper on human-centered machine learning and mental health prediction (joint with Eric P.S Baumer and Munmun De Choudhury) was accepted to CSCW. The camera-ready is uploaded here, if you’d like a read. 5/21/19: Lots going on in the next few months, in addition to the necessary move to Chicago. I’ll be traveling to Rutgers in June for CSST (Consortium for the Science of Sociotechnical Systems).
