General Information General Information Biography Victor Winter is a full professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Nebraska-Omaha and the creator of Bricklayer. His area of expertise is programming languages. Within this area Dr. Winter has a particular interest in formalisms and frameworks that enable the description of computation in a manner that facilitates understanding as well as various forms of analysis. This interest includes, (1) verification – the informal and formal reasoning about properties of programs, and (2) validation – the manual and automated construction of tests to increase confidence in the behavior of a system. Teaching Interests Programming languages, Formal Language Theory, Discrete Math, Functional Programming, Unity Game Programming, Computational Science Research Interests Program Transformation, Language Design,Java Source Code Analysis, Educational Technologies Additional Information Bio I was born in Honolulu Hawaii where I lived for the first two years of my life. After a short stop in San Francisco and Switzerland, my family ended up in Albuquerque New Mexico which I called home until my 2001 move to Omaha. My father was a professor in the Business School at the University of New Mexico. In addition to this, he often taught and did consulting in Europe in the summers. Because of this, I traveled a lot while I was growing up. In addition to summers in Europe, my family spent one year in India and one year in Puerto Rico. This was during the time my father was on sabbatical leave from the university. In addition to computer science, I studied piano performance as an undergraduate and graduate. During my college years, I also played in several rock bands and did a fair amount of writing and recording in small garage studios. On May 12, 2001, I married a wonderful woman named Jennifer and for various reasons both professional as well as personal, we decided to move to the midwest. I ran the interview gauntlet and Omaha captured our hearts, a town which we now call home. Publications V. Winter. The World Needs More Computer Science! What to do?
