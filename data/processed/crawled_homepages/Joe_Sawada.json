No interesting object is left behind. The goal is to gain a more thorough understanding of the object in question by considering how to efficiently list all non-isomorphic instances of that object. Another interesting question that arises, is whether or not each instance can be listed so that there is a constant amount of change between successive objects. Such algorithms are called Gray codes. The study of de Bruin sequences and universal cycles are of particular interest lately.
