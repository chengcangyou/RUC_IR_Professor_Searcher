Starting 2026 I will join ETH Zurich as a full professor. I am interested in theoretical computer science, specifically in conditional lower bounds (e.g. based on the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis) and algorithm design working mostly on optimization and computational geometry. Since recently I also explore realistic machine models. Job Openings In January 2026 I will join ETH Zurich, and thus I am looking for new postdocs. I am currently not offering internships or external Bachelor/Master theses. Moreover, due to a high volume of messages, I am currently unable to respond to internship requests or related inquiries. Thank you for your understanding.
