Follow Melbourne, Australia Email LinkedIn Github Google ScholarWelcome!Hello! My name is Zhuang Li, and I am a Lecturer at RMIT University and formerly a Research Fellow at Monash University. My expertise lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a focus on semantic parsing, social NLP, culturally-inclusive AI, and data-efficient NLP. I am passionate about developing neural-symbolic methods to align large language models with diverse social norms, striving for an inclusive world where AI systems respect and adapt to different cultural backgrounds. My research also focuses on applying semantic parsing to dialogue systems in low-resource settings.About MeI earned my PhD from Monash University, where I was mentored by Dr. Lizhen Qu, Prof. Gholamreza Haffari, and ACL Fellow Phil Cohen. Throughout my career, I have mentored junior researchers, helping them publish in prestigious venues such as AAAI, EMNLP, and EACL. I am dedicated to fostering innovation and collaboration in the NLP community.News07/11/2025: EMNLP 2025: DiscoSG: Towards Discourse-Level Text Scene Graph Parsing through Iterative Graph Refinement selected for the Outstanding Paper Award (7 of 3,200 accepted). Built on our previous FACTUAL work and integrated into FactualSceneGraph, which now has 77,000+ PyPI downloads and 500,000+ model downloads on Hugging Face.

Submission link: openreview.net -> PersonaNLP workshop20/09/2025: Two EMNLP papers accepted — one Main (oral) and one Findings. • Main (oral): Text Scene Graph Parsing - building structured scene graphs directly from text. • Findings: Privacy-preserving NLP - methods for safeguarding user data while maintaining model utility.20/05/2025: Six papers accepted to ACL 2025 main track! Topics include LLM safety, opinion summarization, instruction tuning, causal reasoning, and rule-following in peer review. These works are in collaboration with colleagues from RMIT, Monash, TU Darmstadt (UKP Lab), Microsoft Research India, Wuhan University, and Ant Group.20/05/2025: Serve as an Area Chair for ACL Rolling Review in May 2025!20/02/2025: Serve as an Area Chair for ACL Rolling Review in February 2025!12/02/2024: I joined RMIT University as a Lecturer!I will be recruiting 1 PhD student in the 2025 cycle to work on low-resource languages and culturally-aligned large language models (LLMs).

I welcome applications for:Grant-based students (subject to grant availability)University scholarship applicants (highly competitive)Interested? Feel free to reach out by sending your CV and research interests to zhuang.li@rmit.edu.au!Australian PhD Application TipsHere’s a helpful overview for those considering doctoral studies in Australia and aren’t familiar with the application process: Click to learn about Supervisor-Supported PhD Positions - If your research interests match a supervisor's work, they may support your enrollment directly. The entry requirements are quite flexible and largely depend on the supervisor's discretion. - Enrollment through this path can happen at any time throughout the year, though supervisor grant availability varies. - English Language Requirements: While specific requirements vary by supervisor, typical English benchmarks include:  - IELTS overall band score of 6.5 or higher  - Equivalent scores in PTE or TOEFL Click to learn about University Scholarship Opportunities For International Applicants: - For AI-related students in particular, these scholarships have become increasingly competitive due to limited positions and growing enthusiasm in the field. The competition has intensified as more students pursue AI research. - Applications for university scholarships are only accepted during specific periods. For example, RMIT's 2026 scholarship round opens in April 2025. Plan ahead and prepare your application early! - Recent successful applicants have typically had:A Master's degree from a prestigious universityStrong transcript grades (High Distinction or equivalent grades across different systems - for example, 70+ in British universities or 85+ in Chinese universities)Research experience, demonstrated through a first-authored publication in respected venues (such as CORE A or A* conferences)English proficiency test scores (such as IELTS overall band 6.5 or equivalent in TOEFL/PTE)Note: These are examples from recent successful applications with university scholarship, not fixed requirements. If you aren't selected, please remember this isn't a reflection of your capabilities - stay confident and keep pursuing your goals. For Australian Residents:The Australian government provides Research Training Program (RTP) scholarships for domestic studentsUniversities usually offer additional stipends for RTP recipientsTypical requirements include a minimum overall grade of 75Still, exact eligibility criteria and funding amounts vary by program and supervisor availability.Personal InterestsOutside of academia, I enjoy engaging in hobbies that inspire creativity and relaxation, such as gaming, movies, and reading.
