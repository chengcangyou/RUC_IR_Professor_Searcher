Until 2023, I was a postdoc at UCLA Math, working with Andrea Bertozzi and Jacob G Foster. Before UCLA, I was fortunate to have been advised by Yuejie Chi and Jelena Kovačević during my PhD. I am grateful to have been recognized as Heidelberg Laureate Forum Young Researchers (2025), Rising Stars in Data Science (2022), Rising Stars in Computational and Data Sciences (2022), and CMU ECE Outstanding Woman in Engineering (2021). I have also received teaching awards such as UCLA Math Liggett Instructor Award (2023) and CMU ECE Outstanding TA Award (2020). For students: I am teaching DATA 110 in Fall 2025. If you’re an undergrad hoping to ask for a recommendation letter, see here. If you’re interested in doing research with me: Current UNC grad students and postdocs: You can email me at [my first name] [at] unc [dot] edu if you have ideas for collaboration, but I am not looking to advise any more PhD students in 2025/2026. Non-UNC students and UNC undergrads: Unfortunately, I am not able to respond to most emails asking about joining my lab due to the large volume, so please do not email me. Once UNC Data Science PhD program is open in Fall 2025, please apply there!
