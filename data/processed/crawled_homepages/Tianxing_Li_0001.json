Prior to MSU, I was a Post-doc in the Computer Science Department at UMASS Amherst, working with Prof. Deepak Ganesan. I received my Ph.D. in the Computer Science Department at Dartmouth College in 2020. My Ph.D advisor was Prof. Xia Zhou. I earned my M.S. at Dartmouth College in 2014 and double B.E. from Australian National University and Beijing Institute of Technology in 2012. My research interests are in wireless communication, sensing, mobile security, and low-power systems. Specifically, my recent work focuses on designing practical and secure mobile systems. My work won the Best Paper Award at PerCom 2023, SIGMOBILE Research Highlights in 2016, 2018, and 2021, CACM Research Highlights in 2018, and was selected as a Best Paper Nominee at SenSys 2017. I have fully-funded Ph.D. student positions in the areas of mobile health, mobile systems, AI-related sensing technologies, and ubiquitous computing.
