Before joining Brunel, Federico was a Post Doctoral Research Associate in Explainable AI (XAI) at the University of Lincoln, where he was involved in CONSULT, an EPSRC project in which he worked to improve the system explainability leveraging Computational Argumentation. Federico's Ph.D. studies in Informatics at King's College London were preceded by a Bachelor's degree in Philosophy and a Master's degree in Philosophical Sciences at the University of Milan. His research interests include Non-monotonic Reasoning, Human-computer Interactions, Explainable AI and Computational Argumentation. Federico is co-founder and editor-in-chief of the Online Handbook of Argumentation for AI (OHAAI). Qualifications Ph.D. in Informatics, King's College London, UK. Master's degree in Philosophical Sciences, University of Milan, Italy. Bachelor's degree in Philosophy, University of Milan, Italy. Associate Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy.
