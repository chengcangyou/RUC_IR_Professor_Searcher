Watson Hall 51 Prospect Street New Haven CT 06511 charalampos.papamanthou at yale.edu about My research focuses on computer security and applied cryptography. In particular some of my current projects include verifiable and privacy-preserving computations, with applications to cloud computing security, leakage-abuse attacks on searchable encryption systems, private and scalable blockchains and cryptocurrencies, as well as building real-world privacy-preserving systems. My work is currently supported by NSF, Protocol Labs and JP Morgan. I am always looking for bright and self-motivated students that wish to do research on computer security and applied cryptography. Feel free to contact me if you are interested. I am currently serving as the chair of PhD admissions at Yale Computer Science. research Publications Curriculum Vitae (CV) awards CCS Test-of-Time Award, 2022.
