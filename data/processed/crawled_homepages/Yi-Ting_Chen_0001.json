I received my Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Purdue University under the guidance of Prof. Jan Allebach in 2015. From 2015 to 2020, I worked as a senior research scientist at Honda Research Institute USA. In Spring 2015, I was a visiting researcher at Google ATAP. I was a visiting computer vision researcher in Prof. Ming-Hsuan Yang's group at UC Merced in 2014. I also interned at HP working on an imaging science project. I earned my B.S. in Electronics Engineering from National Chiao Tung University in 2009, during which I was a visiting student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, working with Prof. Thomas Huang in 2009.He is a recipient of the NSTC 2030 International Outstanding Scholar Program (國科會2030跨世代 - 國際年輕傑出學者) in 2024, NYCU CS Outstanding Young Scholar Award (資訊年輕學者卓越貢獻獎) in 2024, the Yushan Fellow Program Administrative Support Grant (玉山學者計畫) from the Ministry of Education, Taiwan, in 2021, the Junior Faculty Award (青年講座教授) from NYCU in 2021, and the Government Scholarship to Study Abroad from the Ministry of Education, Taiwan. He also received Fellowship of the HEA (國際高教會士) from Advance HE in 2023, the Excellent Teaching Award (校級優良教學獎)  from NYCU in 2023, and the Award for Excellent Teaching in English (資訊學院英語教學獎) from NYCU CS in 2024.To Prospective Students[誠徵對人本智慧系統開發與研究充滿熱忱的博士班、研究助理、碩士班、專題生加入團隊]: I am currently looking for highly motivated students (in Ph.D., Research Assistant, M.S., and Undergrad) who are interested in developing Human-Centered Physical AI Systems. Please send me an email with your curriculum vitae (with representative works, research experience, and coursework) and a statement indicating why you are interested in our research.
