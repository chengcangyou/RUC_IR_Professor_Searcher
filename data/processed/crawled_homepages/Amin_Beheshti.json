Amin is the founder and director of the Centre for Applied Artificial Intelligence, the head of the Data Science Lab, and the founder of the Big Data Society at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia. Amin has been honored with the prestigious \"AI Academic/Researcher of the Year\" award at the inaugural Australian AI Awards 2024. He was also a finalist in two additional categories: \"AI Leader of the Year – Enterprise\" and \"AI Rising Star of the Year – Enterprise.\" Amin's long-standing Vision has been to shift the focus of AI from being a tool with endless theoretical potential to one that is actively and intentionally applied to solve meaningful, real-world problems. Amin completed his PhD and Postdoc in Computer Science and Engineering at UNSW Sydney, and holds a Master's and Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, both with First Class Honours. Before starting his PhD in 2009, Amin had over a decade of industry experience as a founder and CEO, consultant, and Solution Architect in national and international organizations. Alongside his teaching activities, Amin has made significant contributions to research projects and successfully secured 60+ research projects (Over $44 million in Research Funding). Amin received Prestigious Awards, including the Australian National AI Award (AI Academic/Researcher of the Year), Excellence Award (Macquarie University, 2023), Excellence in Research Innovation, Partnership Entrepreneurship (Macquarie University, 2022), National Security Impact Award (D2D CRC, 2016 and 2017), Recognition Award (D2D CRC, 2016 and 2017), Australian Postgraduate Award (APA 2009-2012), and several Best Paper awards. In 2021, due to his outstanding performance, Amin was promoted from Senior Lecturer to Full Professor at Macquarie University. As a distinguished researcher in Data and AI Science, Amin has been invited to serve as a Keynote Speaker, General-Chair, PC-Chair, Organisation-Chair, and program committee member of top international conferences.
