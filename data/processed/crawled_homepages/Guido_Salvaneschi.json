We are part of the Institute of Computer Science (ICS) at the University of St. Gallen (HSG). Together we enjoy working on Programming Languages and Software Engineering, including languages and architectures for Distributed Systems, Reactive Programming, DevOps Organizations, and Secure Software Systems. Talk to us or join our group when you are interested in these topics or our work. Students at the University of St. Gallen, please find our courses, theses, and jobs.
