I teach Artificial Intelligence, Object-Oriented technologies (UML, Design Patterns, Python, Java, .Net, Kotlin ...) and Web Programming (Django/Python) both for academics and for entreprises. I am member of the Belgium Royal Academy of Science Biography My interests My main research interests are modelling and control of complex systems, neural networks and fuzzy control, data/graph/text mining, autonomous agents and dynamics of biological networks, computational chemistry, immune engineering, cognitive sciences, bioinformatics and object-oriented technology. My research My books I have written several french books essentially dedicated to computer science. Some go along my teaching activity and have become with the years quite popular in the academic world. Others are essays to help readers to better understand complex systems. And finally two books at the crossroad between science and fictions. List of my books Featured works About IRIDIA UniversitÃ© Libre de Bruxelles Avenue Franklin Roosevelt 50 B-1050 Brussels - Belgium Phone: + 32 2 - 6502733 Fax: + 32 2 - 6502715 nospambersini@ulb.ac.be IRIDIA is the Artificial Intelligence research laboratory of the UniversitÃ© Libre de Bruxelles. It is deeply involved in theoretical and applied research in computational intelligence. The major domains of competence are: (I) swarm intelligence, (II) metaheuristics for the solution of combinatorial and continuous space optimization problems, (III) the foundational study of biological networks, and (IV) business intelligence applications.
