Most recently I was a Post Doc at University of Washington with the Interactive Data Lab, before that I did my Ph.D. at UChicago CS where I was advised by Ravi Chugh. During my Ph.D. I was lucky to intern at Tableau Research and Microsoft Research, as well as to receive a Siebel Scholarship. I’m interested in Human Computer Interaction, Visualization, and Programming Interfaces. More specifically, I like Visualization systems: Building grammars, domain-specific languages, and linters for vis and vis adjacent topics Interfaces for programming: Improving how we interact with code Visualization theories: Forming structures to answer questions like what does it mean for a visualization or tool to be “good” Critical/sociotechnical perspectives: Consider questions of context and situatedness Connecting these domains is an interest in “polite” systems, that is tools that support complex assistance while still allowing you to maintain agency. More broadly, I am a fan of deserts, zines, and bicycles. News November 2025: ReVISit 2 wins best paper at IEEE VIS 2025!! 🎉🎉🎉 November 2025: alt.vis was an overflowing font of joy and chaos! Our papers, on Feng Shui and documenting Charts and Measures won 🏆 Most Auspicious 🏆 and 🏆 Most Meta 🏆 awards respectively August 2025: A big fall! A full VIS paper (on reVISit), a short VIS paper (on annogram), a VL/HCC short paper (on keyframer), five workshop papers (on a range of topics including teaching critical visualization and the fluid programming language), and a VLDB demo paper. July 2025: At long last, our pair of special issues on Critical Data Visualization are out! 🎉 It has a wonderful slate of thoughtful and interesting papers.
