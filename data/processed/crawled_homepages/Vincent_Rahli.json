He is broadly interested in type theory (especially in constructive and intuitionistic theories) and in distributed computing (especially in the foundations and verification of fault-tolerant systems). Please follow the link below to find out more about Vincent's work: Dr Vincent Rahli - personal web page PhD in Computer Science 2011 Vincent obtained a PhD in Computer Science from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburg, Scotland, UK in 2011. During his PhD, Vincent studied both the foundations and applications of intersection type systems. After his PhD, Vincent went on to do a postdoc within the PRL group at Cornell, USA. There, he had the opportunity to learn from amazing colleagues about topics that became his passion, such as intuitionism, formal verification, and distritributed systems. He then had the opportunity to contribute significantly to these topics while he was a Research Associate, within the CritiX system group in Luxembourg from 2015 to 2019. Finally, since July 2019, Vincent is back in the UK, working as a Senior Lecturer at the University of Birmingham Computer Aided Verification, Spring 2020 Intuitionistic type theory Theorem proving Formal verification of distributed systems Real-time fault-tolerant systems Recent publications Article Kozhaya, D, Decouchant, J, Rahli, V & Veríssimo, PJE 2021, 'PISTIS: an event-triggered real-time Byzantine-resilient protocol suite', IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, vol. 32, no. 9, 9347806, pp. 2277-2290. https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2021.3056718 Rahli, V, Bickford, M, Cohen, L & Constable, RL 2019, 'Bar induction is compatible with constructive type theory', Journal of the ACM, vol. 66, no. 2, a13, pp. 13:1-13:35. https://doi.org/10.1145/3305261 Conference article Bickford, M, Cohen, L, Constable, RL & Rahli, V 2021, 'Open bar - a Brouwerian intuitionistic logic with a pinch of excluded middle', Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics, vol. 183, pp. 11:1-11:23. https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.CSL.2021.11 Vukotic, I, Rahli, V & Veríssimo, PJE 2019, 'Asphalion: trustworthy shielding against Byzantine faults', Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages, vol. 3, no.
