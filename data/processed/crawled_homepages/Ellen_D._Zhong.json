Lab for Molecular Machine Learning. She is interested in problems at the intersection of AI and biology. Her research focuses on developing methods for image analysis and 3D reconstruction that enable new discoveries in protein structure, dynamics, and interactions. She obtained her Ph.D. from MIT in 2022, where she developed deep learning methods for 3D reconstruction of dynamic protein structures from cryo-EM images. She interned at DeepMind on the AlphaFold team, and prior to her Ph.D. she worked at D. E. Shaw Research on molecular dynamics algorithms for drug discovery.For more information about her research and group, please visit her group website: https://ezlab.princeton.edu Other Affiliations MolBio PBI Related News November 5, 2025 Tri Dao and Ellen Zhong named AI2050 Fellows by Schmidt Sciences Tri Dao and Ellen Zhong, assistant professors of computer science, have been named AI2050 Early Career Fellows by Schmidt Sciences.
