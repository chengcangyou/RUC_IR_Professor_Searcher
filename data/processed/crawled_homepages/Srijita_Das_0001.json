Sanders & Tia SillersEmail: sridas [at] umich[dot]eduOffice address: Computer and Information Science Department4901 Evergreen Road,  Dearborn, MI  48128CVI am currently a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Computer & Information Sciences department at University of Michigan-Dearborn.  Prior to that, I spent three wonderful years at University of Alberta working with Prof.  Matt Taylor as part of the Intelligent Robot Learning Lab (IRL lab) . I earned my PhD in Computer Science from The University of Texas at Dallas under the supervision of Prof. Sriraam Natarajan . I was part of the StaRLing lab @ UTD .My research interest spans across building sample-efficient models like Active Learning & Cost-sensitive learning to various decision making tasks like Reinforcement Learning, Inverse RL, Imitation learning  etc in structured domains.  I am also interested in leveraging human guidance to guide the sample-efficient and decision making models. Currently, I am interested in using human advice of different modalities and teacher-student framework to guide Reinforcement learning agents towards optimal behaviour more efficiently. News:Our paper on Deep RL and Symbolic Planning has been accepted to AAMAS 2025 (extended abstract).
