My interests lie broadly in the area of Theory of Computation, and in particular, Computational Complexity . My research involves studying various models of computation to understand their computational power and, in turn, understand the role that different resources play in computation. The models that I study typically involve circuits. Previously, I was a postdoc in the Computational Complexity group chaired by Prof. Dr. Markus BlÃ¤ser at Max Planck Institute for Computer Science and Saarland University, SaarbrÃ¼cken, Germany. I obtained my Ph.D in Theoretical Computer Science from The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, where I was very fortunate to have Prof. Meena Mahajan as my advisor. Internships: I am not offering internships in the foreseeable future. Education PhD. The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai (2015) MSc.
