With Pranjal Dutta and Vladimir Lysikov I organized the Algebraic Complexity Theory Workshop at ICALP 2023. I was the main organizer of the Seventh Workshop on Algebraic Complexity Theory (WACT), 2023. I was a co-organizer of the 2021 lecture series on geometric complexity theory. With Mateusz Michałek (formerly MPI-MiS Leipzig) I organized the MPI-INF and MPI-MiS joint workshop on Theoretical Computer Science and Algebraic Geometry that was held in Saarbrücken from January 14 - 18, 2019.
