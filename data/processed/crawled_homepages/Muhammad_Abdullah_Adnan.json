I have completed my PhD from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at University of California San Diego (UCSD), USA working under Professor Rajesh Gupta in the Microelectronic Embedded Systems Laboratory (MESL). My research interest lies in the areas of Big Data Analytics, Cloud Computing Systems, Natural Language Processing and Systems for Machine Learning Applications. During my PhD, I have developed and implemented energy efficient load balancing algorithms for data centers and cloud.I am working as a Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at  Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). I received my MSc Engg. and BSc Engg. degree in CSE from BUET in 2008 and 2006 respectively. I did research on Computational Geometry and Combinatorics as part of my theses works.Notice: I am recruiting PhD, MSc and BSc students for research in the areas of Big Data Analytics, Cloud Computing Systems, Natural Language Processing and Systems for Machine Learning Applications. Interested students are requested to contact me.Recent Publications:Copyright Notice: Permission to make digital/hard copy of all or part of any of the following publications for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage.
