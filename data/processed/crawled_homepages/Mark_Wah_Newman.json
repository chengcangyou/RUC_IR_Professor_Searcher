Newman Professor School of Information EECS Department University of Michigan Bio | CV | Photos Contact Me Associations Interaction Ecologies UX R&D on Coursera MISC DoIIIT About Me I am an associate professor in the School of Information at the University of Michigan. I also have an appointment in the EECS Department. I conduct research in human-computer interaction, ubiquitous computing, and health informatics. I teach courses on user experience research and design, programming, and application development. I have contributed to a number of curriculum design efforts, particularly relating to programming and user experience research & design. I have a mysterious past. I am not the other Mark Newman. Research My research seeks to develop principles, methods, and tools to guide the design of ubiquitous computing applications (i.e., applications and systems that incorporate mobile, IoT, and âsmartâ technology at their core). From early work in end-user configuration of complex environments to more recent work in smart home interaction and personal informatics for health, I have contributed over fifty peer-reviewed articles to the scientific literature in Human-Computer Interaction, Ubiquitous Computing, and Health Informatics. My work draws upon a variety of methods, most prominently featuring qualitative research for gaining a deep understanding of users in particular domains, design, prototyping, and software development for embodying novel design approaches, and small-to-medium-scale field deployments to evaluate novel designs in use. I also employ experimental methods, research through design, online ethnography, crowd-based approaches, and machine learning needed. I have worked in a variety of application areas, including home entertainment, sustainable smart homes, accessible technology, and workplace collaboration. At present, my primary area of interest is mobile and smart health, where I am developing techniques to more effectively incorporate personal health data (a.k.a. patient-generated data) into both formal and informal health care settings. In this work, I am collaborating with researchers from a variety of disciplines, including medicine, engineering, and public health. For more information about my research, please see list of selected publications by topic area and/or my Google Scholar profile (for a mostly-complete list of my publications). If you are interested in a paper but arenât able to access it through the publisherâs site or an academic article database, you can check Research Gate to see if a full-text is available there and request one if itâs not. Iâll try to respond to the request. Work with me! I am always looking for passionate, committed, insightful, talented, and inquisitive students to work with me on research. If you are a current University of Michigan student interested in getting involved in research, please feel free to get in touch. If you are interested in pursuing a PhD under my supervision, you should apply to the PhD program in either the School of Information or Computer Science and Engineering (I have appointments in both units). Be sure to mention that you would like to work with me in your Statement of Purpose (and why!), and I will be sure to review your application. You are also welcome to send me an email introducing yourself, but be warned that I generally do not reply to introductions or questions from students who have not yet been admitted. FAQ Q: Are you admitting PhD students this year? A: Yes. Q: Will you review my CV/application and tell me my chances of getting accepted to the PhD program? A: No. Q: What are the requirements/thresholds for admission for <program I'm interested in>? A: I donât know. Teaching I have taught a number of courses within the School of Information. A full list is below. In addition, I have been deeply involved in several curriculum development efforts, including the overhaul of the HCI/UX curriculum for the MSI degree (2011-2012), the design of the Designing the User Experience track for the BSI degree (2012-2013), the transition of the MSI degree to a mastery-based curriculum (2015-2017), the initial design (2015-2016) and revision (2019) of the programming curriculum for the BSI, MSI, and MHI degrees, the launch of the User Experience Research & Design MicroMasters on edX (2016) (which has since re-launched as the User Experience Research & Design Specialization on Coursera (2019)), and the initiation of a Graduate Certificate in Augmented and Virtual Reality for the Rackham Graduate School at U-M (2017-2019).
