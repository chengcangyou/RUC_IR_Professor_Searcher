My research deals with the analysis of complex systems that can be abstracted as networks or graphs. A central methodological issue underlying my research is how one can study and integrate the multiple levels of organization which are commonly found in a range of systems. My research combines ‘bottom-up’ dynamical models, and ‘top-down’ data-driven approaches, and uses a blend of tools from control theory, dynamical systems, stochastic processes, machine learning and statistics. Fo more information about my group at RWTH see here. News and Events July, 2025 – Happy to announce that I have become director of the center of computational life science at RWTH Aachen University.
