China I am an assistant professor at Peking University. Before joining PKU, I worked as an assistant professor at Aalto University, and I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Weizmann Institute of Science, hosted by Robert Krauthgamer. I obtained my PhD under the supervision of Hubert Chan from the University of Hong Kong, and bachelor's degree from Shandong University. My research field is theoretical computer science, and I am interested in algorithms in a broad sense. Currently, I am working on algorithms for massive data sets, approximation algorithms and online algorithms.
