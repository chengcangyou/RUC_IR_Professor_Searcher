He aims to make causal learning and reasoning transparent in science, AI systems, and human society. On the application side, he is interested in biology, neuroscience, computer vision, computational finance, and climate analysis. His research has been motivated by real problems in healthcare, biology, neuroscience, computer vision, computational finance, and climate analysis. Email Share Before joining MBZUAI, Professor Zhang became associate professorship at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in the USA to explore machine learning and AI, especially causal learning, and reasoning. Professor Zhang formulates principles and develops methods for automated causal discovery or causal representation learning from various kinds of data; investigates learning problems including transfer learning, representation learning, and deep learning from a causal view; and studies the philosophical foundations of causation and various machine learning tasks. Professor Zhang is a general and program chair of the 1st Conference on Causal Learning and Reasoning (CleaR 2022) and a program chair of the 38th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI 2022).
