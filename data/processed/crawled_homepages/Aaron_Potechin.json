I am broadly interested in discrete mathematics and particularly interested in computational complexity theory. I love thinking about problems in my head and I am most driven when there is something I feel should be true and I am trying to figure out how to prove it. My current research focus is on the sum of squares hierarchy, a hierarchy of semidefinite programs which is one of the most powerful tools known for combinatorial optimization problems. I am very grateful to the NSF for their past support of my research through an NSF SMALL grant \"CCF 2008920: Further Investigation of the Sum of Squares Hierarchy\" and a graduate research fellowship. Here is my current CV.",
