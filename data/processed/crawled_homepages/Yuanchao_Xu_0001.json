Prior to that, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University (NCSU), advised by Dr. Xipeng Shen and Dr. Yan Solihin. I have been working as a student researcher at SystemResearch@Google since 2021, where I am advised by Dr. David E. Culler.My research interests are in computer architecture, security, and ML systems and architecture.I have 2 openings for Ph.D. students starting in Fall 2026. Feel free to contact me at yxu314@ucsc.edu if you are interested in working with me!CVNewsOne paper is accepted with shepherding by ASPLOS 2026.
