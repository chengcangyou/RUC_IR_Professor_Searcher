Research: I work on theoretical and applied cryptography, with an emphasis on developing privacy-preserving proof systems (e.g., zk-SNARKs), advanced digital signatures (e.g., adaptor signatures), and secure multi-party computation (e.g., coin-tossing), and exploring their applications in improving privacy, fairness, and accountability in blockchain and ML systems. Education: Through 2020-2023, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at CMU with Vipul Goyal and Elaine Shi. I received my Ph.D. from UC Santa Barbara where I was advised by Stefano Tessaro and Huijia (Rachel) Lin, and got my undergraduate degrees from BITS Pilani Goa (spent a year at NUS Singapore with Prateek Saxena for my thesis). Thanks to Google Research, Stellar Development Foundation, Protocol Labs, and Stena Center for Financial Technology for supporting my work!",
