I hold a secondary appointment in the Computer and Information Sciences department and am a member of the Applied Mathematics (AMCS) graduate group, Penn Institute for Computational Science (PICS), Center for AI-enabled Systems: Safe, Explainable, and Trustworthy (ASSET) and Center For AI And Data Science For Integrated Diagnostics (AI2D). Previously, I held a joint position as a Senior Applied Scientist at Amazon Web Services and a post-doctoral researcher at the California Institute of Technology in Computing and Mathematical Sciences. Currently, I am an Amazon Scholar at Amazon Web Services, where I focus on building large language models. I defended my PhD thesis in the Computer Science department at University of California, Los Angeles in 2018 where I worked with Stefano Soatto in the UCLA Vision Lab. I have Engineer's (2014) and Master's (2012) degrees in Aeronautics & Astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where I worked with Emilio Frazzoli at the Laboratory of Information and Decision Systems (LIDS). I was in the Aerospace Engineering department at IIT Bombay for my undergraduate studies until 2010. I have worked extensively on self-driving cars in the areas of motion planning and computer vision at nuTonomy Inc (now Hyundai-Aptiv Motional). Contact pratikac at seas dot upenn dot edu Address: Amy Gutman Hall 324G CV 2025 Research My research group focuses on (a) theoretical problems in deep learning, and (b) visual perception in robotics. We conduct quite multi-disciplinary research along these lines. We use ideas from information theory, neuroscience, and physics in addition to more classical perspectives from learning theory and computer vision. Everyone, from engineers and computer scientists to mathematicians and physicists will find something interesting to study in our group.

I also regularly mentor Senior Design Projects. Please send me an email if you are interested in working with me. Teaching ESE 546 Principles of Deep Learning (Fall 2019 – 2025) Syllabus Notes: Fall 2024 Accessible notes: Fall 2023 ESE 650 Learning in Robotics (Spring 2019 – 2025, except 2022) Syllabus Notes: Spring 2025 About Waitlists: You do not need to email the instructor to receive a permit, instead you should sign yourself up for the waitlist. After you’ve added yourself to the waitlist, the course instructor can issue you a permit. You will receive an email saying that the permit available. You will receive another email when the permit is issued. At that point, you may register on CoursesInTouch. Both courses above are capped at 144 slots. If you are on the Waitlist, please be patient for slots to open up. Many students adjust their schedules in the first week of the semester. Every year, almost everyone who wants to enroll eventually does get to enroll into these courses. We prioritize students who will graduate before the next offering of the course.
