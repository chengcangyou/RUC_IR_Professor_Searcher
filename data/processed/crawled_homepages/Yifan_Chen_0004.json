I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Department of Statistics, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2023, advised by Prof. Yun Yang. I fortunately work with Prof. Yun Yang, Prof. Ruoqing Zhu, Prof. Heng Ji, and Prof. Jingrui He during my Ph.D. studies. I also collaborated with Prof. Dilek Hakkani-Tur at Amazon Alexa AI, and Dr. Jie Chen at IBM Research. Before that, I received my B.S. degree in Statistics from Fudan University in 2018, advised by Prof. Juan Shen and Prof. Chenghong Zhang. 💻 Research I am broadly interested in the general area of efficient machine learning, aiming to understand the statistical structures of modern machine learning algorithms and apply these insights to real-world computational challenges. I especially focus on non-parametric models and neural networks with intensive matrix operations, such as Transformers (language models) and graph neural networks (GNNs). 🕮 Teaching Fall 25, Spring 25, Spring 24: COMP 7070 Advanced Topics in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Overall, this course is an invitation to core machine learning for AI application research. It aims to familiarize the students with useful concepts in machine learning, and therefore to benefit their own research. Studies related to machine learning is implicitly divided into three genres in this statement: learning theory, core machine learning, and AI application. Scribed lecture notes can be found on this page. Fall 25, Fall 24: COMP 2027 Applied Linear Algebra for Computing 🔥 News 2025.11:  🎉🎉 One paper was accepted to AAAI 2026!
