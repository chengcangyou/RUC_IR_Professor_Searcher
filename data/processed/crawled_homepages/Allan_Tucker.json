Research and Interests My first degree was in Cognitive Science at Sheffield University where I became interested in models of brain function and human and animal behaviour. I am also interested in learning AI models of multivariate time series in order to try and understand the underlying processes generating such data. My Ph.D at Birkbeck College, entitled \"The Automatic Explanation of Multivariate Time Series\" was sponsored by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Honeywell Hi-Spec Solutions, UK; and Honeywell HTC, USA. I spent two Summers working at Honeywell HTC on research and development. Currently, I am working as a senior lecturer at Brunel University, heading the Intelligent Data Analysis Research group. Current projects: Sub-catgeories of disease for patient-specific diagnosis (Awad Alyousef PhD student, Pietro Bosoni with University of Pavia) Non-stationary modelling of disease progression (Lilly Youssefi PhD student) Pseudo time-series trajectory modelling for integrating longitudinal and cross-sectional data (Tom Nealon PhD student with Birkbeck College and Leiden University Medical Centre; Chris Beyer PhD student with Magdeburg University) Dynamics of fish populations in the Northern Atlantic using Hidden Markov Models (Neda Trifonova PhD student; Laura Uuisitalo MSc project with University of Helsinki) Biodiversity informatics for hereogenous data (Nicky Nicholson PhD student) Extreme events in a changing climate: a Big Data perspective (Nathanial Harwood PhD student) A multi-dimensional environment-health risk analysis system for Kazakhstan (British Council Institutional Links Grant) My projects involve collaborations with Moorfield�s Eye Hospital; Royal Free Hospital, Hampstead; Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew; Leiden University Medical Centre, University of Pavia, Magdeburg University, DEFRA and the Canadian Dept of Fisheries and Oceans.
