Her research emphasizes on high performance computing with a focus on the interaction among applications, numerical methods, data structures, algorithms, automatic performance tuning, and computer architectures. She is eager to pursue high performance sparse (multi-)linear algebra, solvers, and tensor decompositions for large-scale data analytics and domain applications on diverse computer architectures. Jiajia Li was an Assistant Professor in Department of Computer Science at the College of William & Mary (W&M), Williamsburg, VA and a Research Scientist at High Performance Computing group of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Richland, WA from 2018-2022. She has received her Ph.D. degree (Aug. 2018) in Computational Science & Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by Professor Richard Vuduc. She has received Rising Stars in Computational and Data Sciences, Best Student Paper Award, and IBM PhD Fellowship. Before, she was a research intern of IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center and Intel Parallel Computing Lab in the summers of 2016 and 2015 respectively. In the past, she has received a Ph.D. degree (Jul. 2013) from Institute of Computing Technology at Chinese Academy of Sciences. She received her B.S. (Jul. 2008) in Computational Mathematics from Dalian University of Technology in the Accelerated Student Program (2/180).
