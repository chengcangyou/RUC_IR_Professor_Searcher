D., HDR (Habilitation Diriger des Recherches) Detail: http://researchmap.jp/andresfrederic/ Introduction Finding solutions by deepening our knowledge In some way, shape, or form, we are all connected in our everyday efforts to use the knowledge that we have gained in the past to overcome the challenges we face today. My research has focused on the field of semantic and collective intelligence in order to arrive at a more enriched understanding and integration of data, behavior, acquired knowledge, and abilities and to then harness that connectivity to come up with innovative solutions to problems. Some of my earlier work was in the digital humanities and the Digital Silk Road Project, seeking to develop cultural heritage archives through the use of both informatics and humanities semantic mapping, and working toward the development of a visual lexical model for representing certain architectural content and managing data. I have also been involved in advances in Multiple Sensory Media, or MulSeMedia, systems, which enhance our multimedia experience through the real-world integration of all our senses for a more interactive and engaging experience, and really to go \"beyond what we think is possible\". Enhancing interactions and transforming mindsets I think it is important to view collective intelligence as an asset, using our past experience to help solve new problems, and working towards learning and achieving solutions in a better, faster way. We are faced with a deluge of data on a daily basis and also the challenge of summarizing what is really needed in a limited amount of time, while at the same time recognizing there may be gaps between expectations and satisfaction. Take for instance my work on intelligent cooking, as part of the Workshops on Data Engineering meets intelligent food and COoking Recipes (DECOR*), which explores the intersection of food science, data science, and data engineering, such as data and software organization, processing, composition integration, and sharing. This is all accomplished within the realm of a universal necessity--food--and, of course, the recipes for cooking it, along with the desire to better understand the expectations and feelings during and after tasting a dish. The acquisition, preparation, and consumption of food are integral parts of our daily lives and all part of the carbon footprint in our kitchens. Research in intelligent food and cooking focuses on not only the process of cooking, but also ways to enhance human-food interactions and really transform our thinking about our cultural and environmental interactions with food and each other through ground-breaking innovations in data science. Increasing awareness for a new vision of the future Sometimes there is hesitancy in embracing something new or taking a step in a different direction, like that hesitation before jumping into a pool of cold water. However, research is rarely linear, and if we take that leap, it often leads us in new and exciting directions, like being able to monitor the moodflow or psychic activity of conference attendees and exploring how to use such data in a beneficial way, or working towards a better understanding of semantic or collective intelligence in the quantum world. The key to any research pursuit is to develop yourself and your awareness of the possibilities, and like data engineering, explore the connectivity of available information for the benefit of society, thereby paving the way for a brighter future. *DECOR@ICDE2022 http://research.nii.ac.jp/decor/decor2022.html PDF Download Last Update: June 2022 View research contents with researchmap ãã¤ã¼ã Research Divisions Research Centers Research and Development Center for Academic Networks Research Center for Knowledge Media and Content Science Research Center for Community Knowledge Center for Cloud Research and Development Center for Dataset Sharing and Collaborative Research Center for Strategic Cyber Resilience Research and Development Research Center for Open Science and Data Platform Center for Research Data Ecosystem Development Center for Trust & Digital Identity Research and Development Global Research Center for Quantum Information Science Global Research Center for Big Data Mathematics Research Center for Mathematical Trust in Software and Systems Research Center for Medical Bigdata Global Research Center for Synthetic Media Research and Development Center for Large Language Models Center for Advanced Mobile Driven Research Faculty Director-General Executives(related to research) Principles of Informatics Research Division FUJII Kaito HIRAHARA Shuichi KAWARABAYASHI Ken-ichi KOBAYASHI Taisuke KUROIWA Ryo MATSUMOTO Keiji SATO Ryoma SHIGAKI Shunsuke SOEDA Akihito SUGIYAMA Mahito TAKEDA Hideaki TATSUTA Makoto UNO Takeaki WATANABE Kazuki WELLNITZ Philip YOSHIDA Yuichi Information Systems Architecture Science Research Division AIDA Kento AOKI Shunsuke FUJIWARA Ikki FUKUDA Kensuke GOSHIMA Masahiro HASUO Ichiro ISHIKAWA Fuyuki JI Yusheng KANEKO Megumi KATO Hiroyuki KITAGAWA Naoya KOIBUCHI Michihiro KURIMOTO Takashi SAKANE Eisaku SATO Hiroyuki SEKIYAMA Taro SHIMIZU Sayako TAKAKURA Hiroki TAKEFUSA Atsuko Digital Content and Media Sciences Research Division AIZAWA Akiko ANDRES Frederic ASANO Yuta HUANG Lang IKEHATA Satoshi KANAZAWA Teruhito KATAYAMA Norio KITAMOTO Asanobu KODAMA Kazuya KOMIYAMA Yusuke KOYAMA Shoichi KURITA Shuhei MO Hiroshi PRENDINGER Helmut SATO Imari SATOH Shin'ichi SUGAWARA Saku SUGIMOTO Akihiro TAKASU Atsuhiro YAMAGISHI Junichi YAMAJI Kazutsuna Information and Society Research Division ARAI Noriko BONO Mayumi ECHIZEN Isao FUNAMORI Miho FURUKAWA Masako GOTODA Hironobu KANDO Noriko KATAOKA Hiroshi KATO Makoto MIZUNO Takayuki NISHIZAWA Masaki OKADA Hitoshi SANO takiko SATOH Ichiro SUN Yuan UEKI Kouichirou Directory of Faculty and Staff index Research staff Other research staff Professor Emeritus Major Project Involvement Kakenhi Human Resource Development Top SE Experts in Information Science Quantum Technology Education Collaborative Research Promotion Collaboration with Industry, Government, and",
