At UTD, I lead the Design & Engineering for Making (DE4M) Lab. Prior to joining UTD, I worked at Purdue University as an Assistant Professor of Interactive Media from 2022 to 2025, and visited Keio University as a visiting Associate Professor in 2025 summer. I graduated from the University of Washington with a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science & Engineering, advised by Jon E. Froehlich. In the past, I also worked as research interns at HP Labs, Microsoft Research in Redmond, and Keio-NUS CUTE Center. The primary focus of my research in HumanâComputer Interaction (HCI) is digital fabrication, aiming to enable customizable and personalized experiences through new pipelines, techniques, and devices that integrate computational and physical intelligence. In my research, I emphasize prototyping and tinkering as processes to explore how people might interact with the physical world across diverse domains, including making, haptics, accessibility, and education. My work has been published in top HCI and UbiComp venues, such as ACM CHI, UIST, IMWUT, TEI, and ASSETS, and has received multiple awards. Research Overview (see the full list of publications on Google Scholar and the DE4M Lab website) #1 Computational Design and AI-Assisted Tools for Creative Tasks Creativity is a fundamental characteristic of human beings, enabling the construction and enrichment of individual experiences in the physical world. Yet, the joy of creation is often limited by the lack of supportive tools. My research group develops computational design and AI-assisted tools that extend usersâ capabilities, facilitating tasks that were previously infeasible and thereby engineering their creative expression.

Forbes, Jacob O. Wobbrock, Anhong Guo, and Liang He PDF arXiv Video Code #2 Streamlined Making Pipelines for Personal Fabrication While digital fabrication technologies enable people to create complex and personalized artifacts, their design and fabrication workflows often remain inaccessible to end users, particularly novices. My research investigates integrated and intelligent pipelines that streamline these processes and lower barriers to making interactive and customizable artifacts through emerging fabrication techniques and machines. Ultimately, this line of research seeks to democratize the means of making, enabling a diverse range of people to participate in the trendy topic.

I envision a future of making in which individual users can create and customize intelligent agents that combine computational capabilities (e.g., interactivity and reasoning) with physical abilities (e.g., mobility and motor control). My research explores software and hardware approaches for constructing such intelligent agents, enabling body-centered and environmental-scale interfacing and interaction.
