Previously Gene had been a group leader at the HHMI Janelia Farm Research Campus (JFRC) since its inception in 2005. Gene came to the JFRC from UC Berkeley where he was on the faculty of Computer Science from 2003 to 2005. He was formerly Vice President of Informatics Research at Celera Genomics for four years where he and his team determined the sequences of the Drosophila, Human, and Mouse genomes using the whole genome shotgun technique that he advocated in 1996. Prior to that Gene was on the faculty of the University of Arizona for 17 years and he received his Ph.D in Computer Science from the University of Colorado in 1981. His research interests include the design and analysis of algorithms for problems in computational molecular biology, image analysis of bioimages, and light microscopy with a focus on building models of the cell and cellular systems from imaging data. He is best known for the development of BLAST -- the most widely used tool in bioinformatics, and for the paired-end whole genome shotgun sequencing protocol and the assembler he developed at Celera that delivered the fly, human, and mouse genomes in a three year period. He has also written many seminal papers on the theory of sequence comparison. He was awarded the IEEE 3rd Millenium Acheivement Award in 2000, the Newcomb Cleveland Best Paper in Science award in 2001, and the ACM Kanellakis Prize in 2002. He was voted the most influential in bioinformatics in 2001 by Genome Technology Magazine and was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2003. In 2004 he won the International Max-Planck Research Prize and in 2005 was selected as one of two distinguished alumni (with David Haussler) at his alma-mater, the University of Colorado. In 2006 Gene was inducted into Leopoldina, the German Academy of Science and awarded an honarary doctorate at ETH, Zurich. since 2012 Director, MPI-CBG Klaus Tschira Chair, Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies 2005 – 2012 Group Leader, HHMI Janelia Farm Research Campus, Ashburn 2003 – 2005 Professor of Computer Science & Molecular Biology,  University of California, Berkeley 2003 – 2005 Staff Scientist, Lawrence Berkeley Labs &amp Joint Genome Institute, Berkeley 1998 – 2002 Vice President of Informatics Research, Celera Genomics, Rockville 1998 – 1999 Director of Informatics Research, Celera Genomics, Rockville 1991 – 1998 Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Arizona, Tucson 1991 – 1998 Professor of Computer Science, University of Arizona, Tucson 1990 Acting Department Head, University of Arizona, Tucson 1987 – 1991 Associate Professor, University of Arizona, Tucson 1987 – 1988 Visiting Associate Professor, The Pennsylvannia State University, State College 1981 – 1987 Assistant Professor, University of Arizona, Tucson 1981 Assistant Professor Adjunct, University of Colorado, Boulder 1978 Programmer/Analyst, National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder 1977 Student research fellow, Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill 1975 – 1980 Research Assistant, University of Colorado, Boulder 1975 – 1981 University of Colorado Ph.D. in Computer Science, May 1981.
