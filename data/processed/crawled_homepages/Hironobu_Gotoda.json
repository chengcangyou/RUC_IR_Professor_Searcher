To do that, we have to express real-world objects and phenomena so that computers can process them. We call this modeling. Expressing an object as a collection of points My research focuses on the modeling of three-dimensional figures. Successful modeling of such figures lets computers recognize objects and create drawings. To make this possible, we have to provide three-dimensional data to the computer. The most common method todaycalls for expressing an object as a collection of numerous points. With this method, many points are placed on the surface of an object and the coordinates of these points are recorded.The more densely concentrated these points, the more accurately the resulting data represent the actual object. This makes it possible to create high-precision models and allows computers to capture and express various aspects of an object. But this method expresses just the overall shape of an object. Since all the points are independent, they don't indicate the correlation between points on two different objects, which prevents functions that would compare objects and examine common features. By looking at the shape of a cat and a dog, for example, humans can easily recognize common features, like four legs. For a computer to perform the same processing, it has to inspect the correlation of points in detail. From imaging to matching The task of comparing two objects to pick out resemblances is called matching. Matching requires dividing each given object into appropriate units and extracting partial features. To implement this, I focused on the correlations between points on the surfaces of objects. When many points are connected to each other, you'll notice that they are not connected in the same way. Some points are densely related to other points. In contrast, some points are not so densely related to other points, and deleting them doesn't make much difference. I removed points that weren't densely related to other points and divided each object into several parts. Dividing objects into parts makes it possible to compare the divided parts of two objects. In the case of a cat and a dog, we created models, divided them into parts like the head, tail, and legs, and compared the corresponding parts. Using this process, a computer can recognize that both have four legs and tails. We can run a matching process to compare not just three-dimensional objects but also plane figures, and to compare a three-dimensional object and a plane figure. By doing this, we canï¾for exampleï¾calculate three-dimensional data for an object from a photo or drawing.For instance, based on a simple sketch, a computer could search through a database for data on objects resembling the sketch. The results of this research may someday give computers the power to process information that needs to be \"seen to be understood.\" PDF Download Interviewed and written by Masumi Nasukawa View research contents with researchmap ãã¤ã¼ã Research Divisions Research Centers Research and Development Center for Academic Networks Research Center for Knowledge Media and Content Science Research Center for Community Knowledge Center for Cloud Research and Development Center for Dataset Sharing and Collaborative Research Center for Strategic Cyber Resilience Research and Development Research Center for Open Science and Data Platform Center for Research Data Ecosystem Development Center for Trust & Digital Identity Research and Development Global Research Center for Quantum Information Science Global Research Center for Big Data Mathematics Research Center for Mathematical Trust in Software and Systems Research Center for Medical Bigdata Global Research Center for Synthetic Media Research and Development Center for Large Language Models Center for Advanced Mobile Driven Research Faculty Director-General Executives(related to research) Principles of Informatics Research Division FUJII Kaito HIRAHARA Shuichi KAWARABAYASHI Ken-ichi KOBAYASHI Taisuke KUROIWA Ryo MATSUMOTO Keiji SATO Ryoma SHIGAKI Shunsuke SOEDA Akihito SUGIYAMA Mahito TAKEDA Hideaki TATSUTA Makoto UNO Takeaki WATANABE Kazuki WELLNITZ Philip YOSHIDA Yuichi Information Systems Architecture Science Research Division AIDA Kento AOKI Shunsuke FUJIWARA Ikki FUKUDA Kensuke GOSHIMA Masahiro HASUO Ichiro ISHIKAWA Fuyuki JI Yusheng KANEKO Megumi KATO Hiroyuki KITAGAWA Naoya KOIBUCHI Michihiro KURIMOTO Takashi SAKANE Eisaku SATO Hiroyuki SEKIYAMA Taro SHIMIZU Sayako TAKAKURA Hiroki TAKEFUSA Atsuko Digital Content and Media Sciences Research Division AIZAWA Akiko ANDRES Frederic ASANO Yuta HUANG Lang IKEHATA Satoshi KANAZAWA Teruhito KATAYAMA Norio KITAMOTO Asanobu KODAMA Kazuya KOMIYAMA Yusuke KOYAMA Shoichi KURITA Shuhei MO Hiroshi PRENDINGER Helmut SATO Imari SATOH Shin'ichi SUGAWARA Saku SUGIMOTO Akihiro TAKASU Atsuhiro YAMAGISHI Junichi YAMAJI Kazutsuna Information and Society Research Division ARAI Noriko BONO Mayumi ECHIZEN Isao FUNAMORI Miho FURUKAWA Masako GOTODA Hironobu KANDO Noriko KATAOKA Hiroshi KATO Makoto MIZUNO Takayuki NISHIZAWA Masaki OKADA Hitoshi SANO takiko SATOH Ichiro SUN Yuan UEKI Kouichirou Directory of Faculty and Staff index Research staff Other research staff Professor Emeritus Major Project Involvement Kakenhi Human Resource Development Top SE Experts in Information Science Quantum Technology Education Collaborative Research Promotion Collaboration with Industry, Government, and Academia Research Results Progress in Informatics NII Technical Reports SPECIAL Overview of NII 2025 Summary of NII 2024 NII Today No.104(EN) NII Today No.103(EN) Overview of NII 2024 Guidance of Informatics Program, SOKENDAI 24-25 NII Today No.102(EN) SINETStream Use Case: Mobile Animal Laboratory [Bio-Innovation Research Center, Tokushima Univ.] The National Institute of Information Basic Principles of Respect for LGBTQ DAAD News Event ",
