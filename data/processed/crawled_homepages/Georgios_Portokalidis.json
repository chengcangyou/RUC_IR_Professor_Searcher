I am also a Visiting Research Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Stevens Institute of Technology. I obtained my PhD in Computer Science from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam on February 2010 and then moved to work as a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University. I also hold an MSc and BSc in Computer Science from Leiden University and University of Crete, respectively. My research interests are mainly around the area of software systems and security. Specifically, I'm interested in securing systems software (e.g., C/C++ programs) against exploitation, binary analysis and reverse engineering, transitioning to the Rust programming language, software containerization, and operating systems security. In the past, I have also worked on honeypots, taint analysis, control-flow integrity, offensive security, and user authentication. For more information check out my CV and my Google Scholar Profile. If you are a strong programmer, security-minded, and love operating systems, I'm looking for students and researchers to join my research group, MadriSec. The IMDEA Software Institute is one of the top institutes for computer security research in Europe! More info under openings.
