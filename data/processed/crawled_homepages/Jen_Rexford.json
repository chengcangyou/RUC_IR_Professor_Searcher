My earlier publications fall into the following main areas: Web protocols and workloads, video proxy services, load-sensitive routing, packet-scheduling architectures, multicomputer router architectures, and fault tolerance and parallel computing. Several of these papers are surveys on the inner workings of Internet Service Provider networks. I also have some non-refereed position papers online that describe the way I think about data networks. See, for example, a recent CCR paper on \"My Ten Favorite \"Practical Theory\" Papers. On a related note, I had the pleasure of giving an talk on \"Building a Strong Foundation for a Future Internet\" (and short write-up) at STOC'08. More recently, I presented the ACM Athena Lecture on \"Hitting the Nail on the Head: Interdisciplinary Research in Computer Networking\" (video, slides) at SIGCOMM'17.
