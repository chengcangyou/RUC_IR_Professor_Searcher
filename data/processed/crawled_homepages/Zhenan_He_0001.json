Before that, I got the M.E. degree from Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, USA in 2011, and the B.E. degree from the University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China in 2008. I am currently a Professor at the College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China. I am mainly engaged in research on industrial intelligence, optimization methods, as well as deep learning. In the field of artificial intelligence, I have published a number of articles as the first author in leading journals and international conferences, such as IEEE TEVC, IEEE TCYB, IEEE SMC, IEEE TNNLS, and IEEE CEC. I have also served as a reviewer for these renowned journals and conferences, while I was awarded as the best reviewer in IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics (TCYB), 2017. I hosted two projects supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), one project supported by the State Key Laboratory Open Fund, and worked as the principal participant in two National Key R&D Programs. Before joining Sichuan University, I worked in Energy New Technologies International, Houston, USA, focused on the research and development of intelligent control systems, while led and completed the application of robust high-dimensional multi-objective optimization techniques based on intelligent optimization algorithms in intelligent control systems.
