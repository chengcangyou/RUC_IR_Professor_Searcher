  "content": "peteinfo | about Pete Bennett Hello! I'm a designer, musician, academic and artist based in Bristol. I'm interested in all things interactive, playful and sound-based, for example I've been involved in created games for gorillas, designing interactive beer bottles, collaborating with composers and chemists to sonify the sound of molecular interaction with a string quartet, putting tiny digital instructions in Lego blocks, developing a post-truth museum guide, and exploring the concept of the musical selfie. Lecturing + Research I’m a lecturer in the University of Bristol’s Computer Science department and long time member (14 years now!) of the Bristol Interaction Group which specialises in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research. I’m interested in researching novel tangible ways of interacting with digital devices, covering areas from musical instrument design, playful interaction, to calm & subtle interaction with slow technology. Design + Music + Art I'm a resident at the Pervasive Media Studio (see the PMStudio video) working on my own creative practice and as a freelance designer. My own work has included audio-based installation art (see 16x16). I co-run Ambient Cafe, a monthly afternoon of ambient music and live performances, and have monthly show \"Muzak Concrète\" on Noods Radio. I have a growing collection of musical instruments and synths. I record \"speed ambient\" under the name Hidden Construct.",
