(Hons), Zhejiang University, Computer Science and Technology, 2015 Research focus: Integrating Physics-Based Simulation with AI for Computer Graphics, Visual Computing, Robotics, and Computational Mechanics. Email | Google Scholar | Research Gate | Github | Twitter | Zhihu Biography Minchen is an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University since 2023. Since 2025, he has also served as an advisor to Genesis AI. Previously, he was an Assistant Adjunct Professor at the UCLA Department of Mathematics, within the AIVC Lab. He completed his Ph.D. in 2020 from the SIG Center for Computer Graphics at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by Chenfanfu Jiang. Minchen's research accomplishments have been recognized with several prestigious awards, including the SCA Early Career Researcher Award (2024), the ACM SIGGRAPH Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award (2021), etc. He is an active member of the research community, regularly serving as a program committee member for conferences such as ACM SIGGRAPH, Eurographics, and SCA, as well as a reviewer for journals including ACM TOG, IEEE TVCG, and CMAME. Simulation Intelligence Group (SIG) The efficacy of solid and fluid simulation methods in the evolving landscape of visual computing, robotics, and manufacturing industries is fundamentally determined by robustness, efficiency, accuracy, and versatility. However, achieving a harmonious balance among these crucial characteristics remains an open challenge. The Simulation Intelligence Group (SIG) led by Minchen is committed to advancing the frontiers of physics-based simulation by striving for unprecedented levels of performance in all these areas, leveraging a comprehensive approach that combines numerical analysis, high-performance computing, and machine learning. SIG is part of Carnegie Mellon Graphics Lab.

If you have a strong background relevant to our research areas and are interested in joining us, you can apply to any of the Ph.D. programs within the School of Computer Science. We recommend prioritizing the Ph.D. in Computer Science program and listing Minchen as a potential advisor. Here are some details about our Ph.D. stipends. Applications with fellowships from external sources are extremely welcome! Our group actively invites visiting students and scholars from around the globe to foster interdisciplinary collaborations. Prospective visits usually range between 6 to 12 months. As we can only fund a limited number of visitors, candidates are encouraged to explore alternative funds from their home institutions, third-party fellowships, etc. The availability of the positions is limited. If you are interested, please email us with the materials listed here. Students interested in a summer research internship/volunteer can directly email us within February and send their CV, transcripts, and specific research interests aligned with our research focus. We appreciate your understanding that, due to a high influx of emails, we may not be able to respond to all inquiries. If you are a CMU student interested in working with us, we strongly recommend embarking on this path by taking foundational and research-focused computer graphics courses, especially 15-362, 15-369, and 15-763. In 15-763, you will primarily work on a research-oriented course project focused on physics-based simulation, which can be combined with your own research. For undergrads and MS students, collaboration opportunities include independent studies, thesis projects, and summer internships through programs such as SURA and SURF, as dedicated time commitments are essential for successful research. Due to the limited number of positions in our group, we prioritize students who demonstrate outstanding performance in 15-763. We are also open to engaging in collaborations of any kind, both within academia and industry!
