Before joining McMaster University, I was a postdoc fellow supervised by Prof. Jian Pei at Simon Fraser University. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. Research Interest My research interest lies broadly in the areas of data mining, machine learning and statistics. My recent research focuses on trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI), which includes privacy, interpretability, security, robustness, and fairness of modern machine learning models, especially, deep neural networks. I am also an expert in federated learning, graph based machine learning, and scalable data mining on large graphs. Many of my previous research outcomes have been successfully deployed as services and products of Huawei Cloud. For example, a personalized federated learning system was deployed as a core service on tens of millions of smart phones running Harmony OS. Google Scholar Recruiting I am recruiting highly motivated students to conduct cutting-edge research on interpreting deep models, defending against adversarial attacks and building next-generation reliable computing frameworks. The competition has been intense due to the large number of applicants each year. We keep a high standard in recruiting new students. • 1 Ph.D. candidate position available starting from Jan. 2025. • 2 intership positions for undergraduate students at McMaster. • 1 position for CSC supported visiting graduate students. • Please send me your transcript(s) and CV if interested.
