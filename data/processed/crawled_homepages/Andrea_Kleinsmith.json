I am also the Graduate Program Director for the Human-Centered Computing MS and Ph.D. programs and Director of the Affective Behavior Interaction Lab. My primary research contributions are in the areas of affective computing and human-computer interaction and focus on investigating affect and related phenomena in real-world simulation training and education scenarios. I examine both individuals and teams to understand how affect is perceived and displayed in complex situations to inform the development and evaluation of interactive systems. The aim is to promote trainees' self-reflection as a mechanism to improve training and facilitate comprehension and conversation around educational and training-related affective phenomena. Prior to joining UMBC, I held postdoctoral researcher positions with Professor Ben Lok in the Virtual Experiences Research Group in the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Department at the University of Florida and with Dr. Marco Gillies at Goldsmiths, University of London. I received a PhD in Computer Science from University College London, UK, advised by Nadia Bianchi-Berthouze and Anthony Steed, an MSc in Computer Science from the University of Aizu in Japan, and a BA in Psychology from the University of Oregon.
