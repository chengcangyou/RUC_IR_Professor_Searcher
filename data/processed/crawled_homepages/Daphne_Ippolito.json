I study the tradeoffs and limitations of generating text with neural language models, as well as strategies for evaluating natural language generation systems. I also research how to incorporate AI-in-the-loop language generation into assistive tools for writers. I completed my PhD at University of Pennsylvania, co-advised by Professor Chris Callison-Burch at UPenn and Principal Scientist Douglas Eck at Google Brain.  You can read my dissertation here.Please see here for instructions on how to email me.Office Location: Gates & Hillman Centers, room 6407Mailing Address:Carnegie Mellon University5000 Forbes AvenueGates Hillman Complex 6407, LTIPittsburgh, PA 15213Phone Number: ‪(267) 702-4688Google SitesReport abusePage detailsPage updated Google SitesReport abuse",
