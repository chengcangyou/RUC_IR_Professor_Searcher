Follow Uppsala, Sweden Email LinkedIn Github Google ScholarI’m a WASP Fellow, ELLIS member, and assistant professor in Artificial Intelligence (AI) at Uppsala University. My research interests are primarily in machine learning and optimization.Prior to joining Uppsala University, I was a senior research scientist at the radiotherapy company Elekta where I was also an industrial PhD student affiliated with Linköping University.At Elekta, I did research on machine learning, optimization and medical image analysis (MRI in particular) which resulted in more than 25 patent applications. I’m particularly proud of the work on dose optimization which formed the basis for Leksell Gamma Knife Lightning.Working with meI’m always on the lookout for curious and self-driven people as well as exciting collaborations (with both industry and academia) that align with my research vision.
