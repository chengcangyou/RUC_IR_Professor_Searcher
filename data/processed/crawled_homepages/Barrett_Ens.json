He held two student research internships with the User Interface Research Group at Autodesk Research in 2015 and 2016, before undertaking an NSERC Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at the University of South Australia’s Empathic Computing Lab. His main research interest is the design of next-generation user interfaces that exist beyond the confines of flat screens. As computing hardware continues to shrink and meld into our surrounding environment, our digital interactions are expanding; we must rethink how to integrate the information we increasingly rely on into our tangible, social, and physiological realms.
