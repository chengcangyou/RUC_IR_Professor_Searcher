News We have kicked off the NICO Challenge, a contest for OOD image recognition. Together with Susan Athey, we published a perspective paper on stable learning in Nature Machine Intelligence. We published a survey paper on out-of-distribution generalization here, accompanied with a website to maintain the paper list for OOD generalization.
