Such systems increasingly pervade our lives, yet their growing complexity makes it humanly impossible to reason about all corner case behaviours. Mathematically provable guarantees are therefore crucial to ensure that the systems we increasingly trust our lives on are indeed trustworthy. My research focuses on (i) formal verification, wherein we provide a formal proof that a system satisfies a property or demonstrate its violation, (ii) rigorous analysis of system models to extract meaningful information, and (iii) automated synthesis of systems from specifications, with the guarantee that the synthesized system satisfies the specification. I have applied formal methods to reason about software, hardware, machine learning and biological systems. The gap between theory and practice of formal methods concerns me deeply and I have consciously tried to bridge this gap in my work. I'm also affiliated to Centre for Formal Design and Verification of Software and Centre for Liberal Education at IIT Bombay.
