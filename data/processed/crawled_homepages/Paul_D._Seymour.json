Contact Info: Email: pds@math.princeton.edu Office: 200 Fine Hall, Washington Rd, Princeton NJ 08544. Phone: (609) 258-4685 Affiliation: Professor, half in the Department of Mathematics and half in the Program in Applied and Computational Math at Princeton University. Research: Discrete math, mostly in graph theory; I am currently working on the structure of graphs with certain induced subgraphs forbidden. In particular I am interested in the Erdos-Hajnal conjecture and in the various conjectures of Gyarfas about chi-boundedness. The web pages of Maria Chudnovsky and Robin Thomas have more information about our joint work. Here are websites for the last ten Barbados graph theory workshops and the current one: 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2022, 2022a, 2024, 2025, Click here for CV.
