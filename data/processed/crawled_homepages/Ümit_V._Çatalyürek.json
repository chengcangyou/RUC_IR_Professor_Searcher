Peachtree St NW Atlanta GA 30332 Biographical Sketch I received my B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Bilkent University, Turkey, in Computer Engineering, in 1992, 1994, and 2000, respectively. Before joining the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2016, I was Professor and Vice Chair in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at the Ohio State University. And long before that, I worked at Johns Hopkins University as a Research Associate and at the University of Maryland as a Visiting Research Scientist. See Complete Vita. CSE Graduate Programs I used to serve as the Director of CSE Graduate Programs. You can find the CSE Graduate Student Handbook and other forms here, and slides of a recent orientation here. Research My research interests broadly include topics in high performance computing, combinatorial scientific computing and biomedical informatics. In particular, I am interested in graph and hypergraph partitioning, workload and data decomposition for irregular domains, scheduling, parallel graph and hypergraph algorithms, run time systems for high performance computing and data-intensive computing, parallel algorithms for scientific and biomedical applications. More information can be found on my research lab (TDAlab) web site or my, somewhat outdated, research page.
