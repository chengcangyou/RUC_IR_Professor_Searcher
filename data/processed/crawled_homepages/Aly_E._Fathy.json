This study helped in reducing the effect of blind spots caused by the surface/creeping waves due to the presence of the radome in vicinity of the radiating structure. M.Sc.:Electrical Engineering, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt, Jan 1980 Thesis: Microwave Planar Circuits The thesis was a theoretical EM analysis of microstrip lines using Weiner-Hopf Technique. B.Sc , School of Science., Ain Shams Univ., Cairo, Egypt, 1979 Pure and Applied Mathematics (Honors) B.Sc., Electrical Engineering (Honors), Ain Shams Univ., Cairo, Egypt Project: Microwave Phase Shifters Experience Associate Professor, University of Tennessee,the Department of ECE, Auguest 2003 - present Senior Member, Technical Staff, Communications & Networking, May 2001-July 2003 Member, Technical Staff, Microwave Group, Feb 1985- April 2001. Research Interests Teaching To obtain specific information on the following courses, just click on the desired title: ECE 443 -- Antennas and Propagation Fall 2003, Fall 2004, Fall 2005: Re-established undergraduate and graduate antenna theory Class; established CAD (HFSS) high frequency structure simulator analysis and design tool. Established layout capability and fabrication of printed circuit antennas for student projects. Established Antenna testing capability for far field measurements and input impedance characterization. Updated curriculum in ¡¯04 to follow Kraus book-third addition, and again in ¡¯05 to follow Balanis newest antenna theory book. 20 HFSS licences were donated by Ansoft company, and another 20 Maxwell¡¯s licenses, in addition to Sonnet and CST companies donations. ECE 545 -- Introductory Microwave Networks and Components Spring 2004, Spring 2005, Spring 2006: Developed a new course for graduate microwave circuit design course; established CAD (ADS) microwave circuit and system analysis and design tool, acquired over a $500K gift from Agilent (30 Full licenses), Established a full layout and assembly capability for active and passive microwave circuit design, fabrication, and testing. Established microwave circuit testing capability in both the frequency and time domains. Current systems extend beyond 18 GHz for full S-parameters measurements. ECE 541 -- Electromagnetic Fields Spring 2005: Developed a new course for graduate students on basic electromagnetic theories. Various analysis programs were developed by students and have been utilized by other students. The course was based on a new book by C. Balanis on Electromagnetic theories. ECE 691 -- Fall 2006: established a new course on advance phased array antennas. The course requires extensive analysis and design. CAD tools include HFSS and developing new software. State-of-the-art materials, designs, and problems will be discussed in detail. The course is based on ¡°phased array antennas¡¯ book by R. C. Hansen. ECE 641 -- Fall2006: Established a new course that will be offered at UT for the first time and will be devoted to advanced electromagnetic analysis. The course is a continuation of ECE541 and would go beyond commercial software packages, to develop our own numerical and computational algorithms that will be validated by the newly established lab. The new laboratory has been equipped with 40 GHz measurements setup and most of its equipments were donated. ECE 491/599 -- Fall 2003, Fall 2004: Established a new graduate/undergraduate course on fiber optical communications. It is a very successful course, and many undergraduate students enjoyed it. Multi-Disciplinary Courses: RF and Microwave Biological Effects ECE599/MABE599: Fall 2005: Developed a new course that involves students from ECE Department and Biomedical Department. The emphasis is in building team-work and crossing the departments. Teams from both background have been involved in both EM simulation, tissue material characterization, and evaluating cell phone effects on human bodies. The course is based on a book that will be officially published in November, by Wiley and we are first in the nation to establish such course.
