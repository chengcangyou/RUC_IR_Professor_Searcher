From March 1990 to February 1996 she was research scientist at the Institute of Operating Systems and Computer Networks at the TU Braunschweig. There, she established the research field \"Distributed Systems\" and was head of the working group \"Failure Tolerance and Load Balancing in Distributed Systems\". During this time, Bettina Schnor did also lecture at the Justus-Liebig-University Giessen (October 94 - July 95). From March 1996 to September 1996 she was a lecturer at the BTU Cottbus for Operating Systems, and from October 1996 to March 2000 she was researcher and lecturer at the Institute for Telematics at the Medical University of LÃ¼beck, Germany. In 1998 she habilitated at TU Braunschweig. The topic of her habilitation thesis is \"Scheduling and Migration Strategies for Parallel Applications on Distributed Systems\". Since April 2000 she is head of the Department of Operating Systems and Distributed Systems at the University Potsdam. From 2006 - 2009 and from 2022 - 2023 she was also head of the Computer Science Institute of the University of Potsdam. She has been appointed by the BMBF for the period 2023 - 2026 to the Scientific Advisory Board of the Gauss Center for Supercomputing (GCS). Research Interests Her research interests are in the area of distributed systems and cluster computing with a focus on communication networks, in particular high performance communication and network security.
