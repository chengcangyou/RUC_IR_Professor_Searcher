The Ohio State University B.Sc. UET Lahore E-mail: akarim at lums dot edu dot pk I am interested in data mining and machine learning algorithms and applications. My current research directions include natural language processing of Urdu and other low-resource languages, text categorization and clustering, and causal analysis and inference from observed data. I direct the Knowledge and Data Engineering (KADE) Lab @ LUMS. I also work on assistive technologies for persons with disabilities with particular focus on technologies for persons with vision impairment. My teaching engagements are given below.
