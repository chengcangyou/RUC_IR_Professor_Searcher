Currently, I mainly work on diffusion models and their applications for solving inverse problems, as well as the theoretical aspects of large language models. Previously, I was a postdoc with Prof. Jonathan Scarlett at the Department of Computer Science, National University of Singapore (NUS). I received my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Mathematics at NUS in 2017, under the supervision of Prof. Weizhu Bao and Prof. Vincent Yan Fu Tan. I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the Department of Mathematical Sciences of Tsinghua University in 2013.Always looking for self-motivated Ph.D./master students with strong mathematical/computer-science background. Professional ServiceReviewer for journals such as IEEE JSAIT, TIT, TPAMI, TSP, and conferences such as ICLR (22-), ICML (22-), NeurIPS (21-), CVPR (23-).In general, I only review for journals or conferences to which I have submitted papers, and I only review papers that are related to diffusion models and imaging inverse problems. I won't review papers for open-access journals with high charges.Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler. Albert Einstein Google SitesReport abuseGoogle SitesReport abuse",
