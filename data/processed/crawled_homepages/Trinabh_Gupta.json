Before joining UCSB, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Systems Security and Privacy research group at Microsoft Research, Redmond where I spent one year. I received my PhD in Computer Science from The University of Texas at Austin, where I was advised by Michael Walfish and Lorenzo Alvisi. Research Interests My research interests are in computer systems, security, and privacy. I especially enjoy taking theoretical constructs from the literature on cryptography (e.g., private information retrieval and homomorphic encryption) and carefully applying them to add strong privacy guarantees to computer systems.
