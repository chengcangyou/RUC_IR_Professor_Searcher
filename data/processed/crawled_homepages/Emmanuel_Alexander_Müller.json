In the meantime, please feel free to check out our online lecture for a quick introduction or have a look into our recent machine learning research. Open PhD Positions Methods and Algorithms in Machine Learning We are continuously hiring PhD students in the research areas of Representation Learning on Complex Data, Explainable and Trustworthy Anomaly Detection, Verifiable Predictive Analytics with a strong background in statistics, linear algebra, scalable algorithms, and formal methods. If you have interest in these research areas apply for open PhD positions. Research and Teaching Overview Our research covers data mining, machine learning, scalable algorithms, and interactive exploration for high dimensional data, complex graphs, time series, and data streams. The chair is leading and contributing to several open-source initiatives enabling repeatability and comparability for the research community. We have organized several tutorials and workshops at major data mining, database, and machine learning conferences, and edited a special issue for the Machine Learning Journal. In the past few years, we have initiated and coordinated various education programmes for “Data Science” and “Data Engineering”: One on the level of university education (M.Sc. programme), two graduate schools (PhD programmes) and multiple executive education programmes for industry. Research Activities Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Knowledge discovery and data mining, as part of many scientific and industrial applications, does not end with the execution of algorithms. With data mining algorithms, resulting in the discovery of unknown, novel, and unexpected patterns, one should aim at assisting humans in their daily decision making. On the one side, we investigate efficient algorithms, which scale with size and complexity of the data. Moreover, on the other side, our algorithms generate verifiable and explainable knowledge for human users. PostDoc positions within our chair are open to complement our research on representation learning, anomaly detection, predictive analytics and explainable machine learning. We are looking for candidates with a strong background in machine learning, scalable algorithms, or statistical methods. Algorithms for Big Data Analytics Our research addresses theoretic challenges in correlation analysis, representation learning, (un-)supervised feature selection, cluster and outlier detection as well as practical challenges in efficient computation of these models in large and complex datasets. The development of novel techniques for complex data spaces (e.g. graph structures, time series, data streams, or high dimensional data) is a particular challenge in this area. We overcome information loss and scalability challenges of traditional data mining techniques that assume homogeneous data and enable big data analytics on heterogeneous datasets. Our chair investigates algorithms for the selection of relevant attributes in high dimensional data, correlations in time series data, change in multivariate data streams, and similarity structures in graph data. Verifiable Knowledge Discovery for Human Users Our research aims at an easy to understand presentation of data analytics results. We represent intrinsic dependencies between different information sources for human users. Our research includes exploring the automatic extraction of dependencies and pattern descriptions, which is a significant research contribution for many applications where patterns have to be verified by the users. Human users require such descriptions of potential reasons for each of the detected patterns. Hence, we have proposed verifiable descriptions for learned representations, unexpected patterns, user-driven data exploration, and explainable data profiling. Teaching Activities Data Science Education In our lectures, we cover fundamental concepts in the field of Big Data Analytics for students in B.Sc./M.Sc. Computer Science and B.Sc./M.Sc. Data Science programmes. Techniques for the analysis of large and complex datasets have a significant impact in many industrial and scientific applications. In science, industry, and society, in general, there is the necessity of understanding complex data by extracting valuable patterns from a multitude of datasets. In our courses, we introduce the systematic processing of large data volumes as a precondition for both human data understanding and automatic data analysis. We teach fundamental data analytics techniques applicable to different domains in science and industry. In the Winter Term we offer the introductory lecture \"Big Data Analytics\", a Seminar \"Machine Learning for Sequential Data and Graph Data\", and an advanced lecture \"Data Science Challenges in Practice\". The basic lecture is open for students without prior experience in machine learning, while the advanced lecture, the seminar, and thesis projects require fundamental knowledge in machine learning, scalable algorithms, or statistical methods. In the Summer Term we offer the advanced lecture \"Machine Learning Paradigms for Complex Data\", a project group on \"Verifiable and Explainable Machine Learning\", and an introductory lab course \"Big Data Analytics Lab\". The basic lab course is open for students that have interest in a practical experience with machine learning, while the advanced lecture, the project group, and thesis projects are more theory- as well as research-oriented. Additionally, we offer \"Studienarbeiten\" following the INTEGER teaching concept within our chair in the research areas representation learning, anomaly detection, and verifiable learning. For example, we offer “Explainable Anomaly Detection” as one open thesis project. Students with interest in such machine learning topics can apply at any time! Lectures, Labs, and Seminars We provide basic lectures, lab courses, and practice-oriented projects as introductory courses: Big Data Analytics (every winter term) Fundamentals in Statistics and Linear Algebra Fundamentals in Data Structures and Scalable Algorithms Big Data Analytics Lab (every summer term) (incl. annual Data-Mining-Cup competition) Projects on selected machine learning topics (e.g. “Predictive Diagnostics”, “Graph Exploration”, …) We provide a selected set of advanced lectures and research seminars for specialization in data science and engineering: Machine Learning for Sequential Data and Graph Data Machine Learning Paradigms for Complex Data Graph Mining and Exploration Indexing Structures for Efficient Database Access Data Science Challenges in Practice Smart Representations for Big Data Analytics Data Science Research Labs (e.g. “Exploration of Complex Networks”, “Representation Learning for Predictive Maintenance”, …) INTEGER Teaching Concept In our Data Science and Data Engineering Labs, we supervise students w.r.t. open research challenges. Courses reflect our research focus on formal problem settings and scalable algorithmic solutions. As result of these lab courses we aim at publication and presentation of results at international conferences, i.e. students will participate in the entire research process! We have named this course style “INTEGER”. INTEGER provides students the opportunity to participate in research. As part of lab courses, we supervise Bachelor and Master students w.r.t. open research challenges, development of novel solutions, publication of results, and let the studentâs present their work at international conferences. With INTEGER students have successfully participated in the entire research process and gained enthusiasm for research.
