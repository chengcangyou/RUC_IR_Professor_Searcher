Experience Post-graduate training: Post-Doctoral Fellowship in Cancer Immunology & Computational Genomics, Carole and Ray Neag Cancer Center, University of Connecticut Health Center Biography Dr. Marmar Moussa joined the University of Oklahoma in July 2023 as assistant professor at the School of Computer Science, Gallogly College of Engineering. Prior to that, Dr. Moussa served as assistant professor of Medicine at the University of Connecticut (2021-2023) where she was a postdoctoral fellow (2019-2021).  She is an experienced computer engineer and basic scientist with research interests in computational biology and cancer immuno-omics. She received her Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering 2019 with a focus on Computational Genomics from UConn, where she also received the prestigious CSE Taylor Booth Fellowship. Additionally, Dr. Moussa holds two M.Sc. degrees in CSE focus areas Bioinformatics (2018, University of Connecticut) and Cryptography(2004, Alexandria University, EG). Dr. Moussa’s research passion includes the design of advanced algorithms and machine learning methods for single cell genomics applied to Cancer Immunology. Her work includes publications in Science Immunology, Nature, Journal of Clinical investigations, Nature Communications, BMC Genomics, Journal of Computational Biology, and others.  Dr. Moussa's recent funding includes the NIH-NCI K25 Career Development Award (K25CA270079 M. Moussa PI, $993,605) and NSF2212512 (M. Moussa PI, $200,000) for projects studying tumor etiology, evolution, and the tumor microenvironment in single cell resolution.

Computational Advances in Bio and Medical Sciences: 10th International Conference, ICCABS 2020, Virtual Event, December 10-12, 2020, Revised Selected Papers 10, pp. 71-87. Springer International Publishing, (2021). doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-79290-9_7 The variation in gene expression profiles of cells captured in different phases of the cell cycle can interfere with cell type identification and functional analysis of single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data. In this paper, we introduce SC1CC (SC1 Cell Cycle analysis tool), a computational approach for clustering and ordering single cell transcriptional profiles according to their progression along cell cycle phases. We also introduce a new robust metric, Gene Smoothness Score (GSS) for assessing the cell cycle based order of the cells. SC1CC is available as part of the SC1 web-based scRNA-Seq analysis pipeline, publicly accessible at https://sc1.engr.uconn.edu/ CRISPR-guided reversion reveals the immunogenicity of a “non-MHC binding” cancer neoepitope in vivo Ebrahimi-Nik, H., Moussa, M., Englander, R., Singhaviranon, S., Michaux, J., Pak, H., ... & Srivastava, P.
