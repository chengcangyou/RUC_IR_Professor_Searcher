My research uses Social Informatics perspectives to investigate public engagement with science, knowledge sharing, and communities of practice in mediated environments. Recently, I investigated how two-way science communication has been enabled and/or impeded by social media. I also organized an open panel called “Making Science in Public: Studying Relations Within Science Communication and Public Engagement” at 4S and EASST with colleagues, Sarah R Davies and Maja Horst. See also the special issue of Science Communication that I co-edited with Sarah. I am currently interested in how social media can help or impede public engagement with science. More specifically, my research investigates the public engagement with scientific topics of COVID-19 (NSF #21-52423), Climate Change, and Artificial Intelligence on Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit. I am the author of Communities of Practice: Fostering Peer-to-Peer Learning and Informal Knowledge Sharing in the Work Place from Springer and a co-editor of Global Wikipedia: International and Cross-Cultural Issues in Online Collaboration from Rowman & Littlefield and Social Informatics from Routledge both co-edited with Pnina Fichman. In the past, NSF funded my research project looking at tacit knowledge sharing in life science graduate programs (NSF #08-30137).",
