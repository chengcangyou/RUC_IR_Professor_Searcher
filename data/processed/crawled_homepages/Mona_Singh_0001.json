We leverage high-throughput biological datasets in order to develop data-driven algorithms for inferring protein interactions, specificity and networks; for predicting the impact of mutations and variation, especially in the context of disease; for uncovering protein functions via sequences and structures; and for analyzing biological networks in order to uncover cellular organization, functioning, and pathways. An appreciation of protein structure guides much of our research.
