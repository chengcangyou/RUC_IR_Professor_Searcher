I am a full professor at the Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic. I am also affiliated as a professor for Formal Methods for Software Reliability at the Chair for Foundations of Software Reliability and Theoretical Computer Science, with Technical University of Munich, Germany. We are hiring postdocs/PhD/undergrads on EU projects on verification&AI, in particular the ERC grant InOVationCS starting in June 2025. For the concrete research areas, please visit the updated webpage of our LiVe Lab and see the call. Contact firstname.lastname@tum.de Room: MI 03.11.044 Faculty of Informatics, Technical University of Munich Boltzmannstr. 3, 85748 Garching, Germany Tel.: +49 89 289 17209 ORCID iD: 0000-0002-8122-2881 I may look like any of the guys on the right. So don't be surprised when contacting me in person:-) Research ha-index: 89 Areas verification and synthesis probabilistic model checking applications of machine learning in verification verification of learnt systems, e.g. neural networks explainable AI, in particular explainable controllers of cyber-physical systems temporal logics, in particular LTL and PCTL automata theory continuous-time stochastic processes and games modal transition systems Publications See DBLP or Google Scholar. Tools Automata Tutor v3 is a teaching tool for courses on automata theory and introduction to computation SeQuaiA performs semi-quantitative analysis of chemical reaction networks dtControl 2.0 represents CPS controllers as decision trees, improving memory footprint and explainability while preserving guarantees Rabinizer 4 translates LTL formulae to various (semi-)deterministic automata (previous versions 3.1 and 2) with Owl as a reusable library for developing such translations with additional infrastructure MoChiBA is a PRISM-based probabilistic LTL model checker based on semi-deterministic (limit-deterministic) Büchi automata MoTraS for modal transition systems and their extensions PET (Partial Exploration Tool, aka PRISM TUM in QComp, under development) is a probabilistic model checker for stochastic games, MDP and related models with (unbounded) reachability and mean payoff objectives, featuring also a module for statistical model checking Projects (running) Verified AI is a collaboration with AUDI AG on subprojects of EU H2020 Hi-Drive project. Group-By Objectives in Probabilistic Verification (GOPro) is a DFG project 427755713. Continuous Verification of CYber-Physical Systems (ConVeY) is a DFG research training group GRK 2428. Projects (previous) Statistical Unbounded Verification (SUV) is a DFG project 383882557. Verified Model Checkers (VMC) is a DFG project 317422601. Platform-Aware Synthesis of Embedded Control Software (PARSEC) is a TUM IGSSE project 10.06. In collaboration, my PhD student Julia Eisentraut has obtained the following projects: Proven Security for systems with human interaction (ProSec) is a project funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung) and supported by Software Campus performed in collaboration of TUM and DATEV eG Formal Methods for Analysis of Attack-Defence Diagrams is a PhD project of Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes Community service Events organization Dagstuhl Seminar 24361 Artificial Intelligence and Formal Methods Join Forces for Reliable Autonomy, September 2024 Dagstuhl Seminar 24231 Stochastic Games, June 2024 LiVe 2024: 8th workshop on Learning in Verification, satellite event of ETAPS, April 2024 LiVe 2023: 7th workshop on Learning in Verification, satellite event of ETAPS, April 2023 ETAPS 2022 (general chair) FOMEO 2022: 2nd Workshop on Formal Methods Education Online, proposed as a satellite event of FLoC, July 2022 LiVe 2022: 6th workshop on Learning in Verification, satellite event of ETAPS, April 2022 FOMEO 2021: Formal Methods Education Online, satellite event of ICALP, July 2021 LiVe 2021: 5th workshop on Learning in Verification, satellite event of ETAPS, March 2021 LiVe 2020: 4th workshop on Learning in Verification, satellite event of ETAPS, April 2020 postponed due to COVID-19 until next LiVe edition LiVe 2019: 3rd workshop on Learning in Verification, satellite event of ETAPS, April 2019 Game Solving: Theory and Practice, satellite event of ICALP, July 2018 LiVe 2018: 2nd workshop on Learning in Verification, satellite event of ETAPS, April 2018 Dagstuhl Seminar 18121 Machine Learning and Model Checking Join Forces, March 2018 Workshop on Formal Methods for Attack Trees, Munich, November 2017 LiVe 2017: 1st Workshop on Learning in Verification, satellite event of ETAPS, April 2017 PC Member 2025: AAAI-DC, CONCUR, FMICS, ICALP, ICTAC, RV, VMCAI 2024: FMICS, ICTAC, ISoLA (track co-organizer), LATIN, LiVe (chair), MOVEP 2023: AISoLA (track co-organizer), CD-MAKE, DAV, FORMATS, ICALP, ICTAC, LiVe (chair), QEST, TiCSA 2022: LICS, LiVe (chair), QEST, TACAS, VMCAI 2021: CMSB, CONCUR, HSCC, LiVe (chair), QEST, TACAS 2020: CMSB, GandALF, ICTAC, LiVe (co-chair), NETYS, QEST, TACAS, TTCS, VMCAI 2019: ACSD, FORMATS, GandALF, ICTAC, LiVe (co-chair), MoRe, QAPL, SR, TACAS, VMCAI 2018: ACSD, CAV (AEC), FORMATS, ICTAC, LiVe (co-chair), QAPL, QEST, SR, TACAS 2017: ACSD, FORMATS, LiVe (co-chair), QAPL, QEST, SOFSEM, TACAS, TIME, TTCS 2016: ECAI, MEMICS 2015: QAPL SC Member ETAPS (since 2021) My programme to support EATCS I would like to support continuous summer-school activities to raise awareness of importance of TCS among the young researchers and as means of building bridges to other areas of CS, in particular AI. Further, I would like to help preserving the balance within the brotherhood of TCS \"Volume A\" and \"Volume B\" through equal efforts in advertisement and prize-awarding activities.
