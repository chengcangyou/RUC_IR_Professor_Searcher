I’m broadly interested in theoretical computer science but I’m especially keen on graph-theoretic questions in approximation algorithms, online algorithms, distributed algorithms and metric embeddings. I completed my PhD in computer science in the Carnegie Mellon Computer Science Department. After that, I spent a lovely year as a postdoc in the ETH Zürich Math Department in the Mathematical Optimization Group. My research is supported by NSF grant CCF-2403236. If you’re a student interested in doing research on algorithms with me, please read this page. Fall 2025 I’m organizing the Brown Theory Seminar with Richard Huang. If you’re a theory researcher in the Boston/Providence area, consider giving a talk! Recent Publications Some recent publications that I’m particularly excited about and or actively working on.
