Previously, I was a postdoc researcher at UW, mentored by Prof. Huijia (Rachel) Lin. I received my master and Phd degrees from MIT, where I was fortunately advised by Prof. Vinod Vaikuntanathan. I received my bachelor degree from IIIS Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. John Steinberger. I have broad interest in cryptography and TCS in general. So far, most of my research belong to one of the following: information theoretic (IT) cryptography. Problems such as PIR, CDS, PSM, secret sharing. secure multi-party computation. I prefer protocols with IT \"flavor\". garbled circuit. Can we beat boolean circuit size barrier from simple assumptions. analysis of practical cipher from an IT perspective. How to argue the security of AES? seperation. (im)possibility of basing cryptography on NP-hardness. [CV] [dblp] [google scholar] Prospects Phd Student (enroll in 2027) Motivated students interested in the theory of cryptography. You will need some background in cryptography and/or theoretical computer science (TCS) -- ideally some advanced courses and research experience.
