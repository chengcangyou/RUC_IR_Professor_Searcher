I am interested in the design and analysis of algorithms for problems in various domains such as scheduling, resource allocation, graph colouring and geometry. I also have an interest in the development of efficient practical heuristics for real-life problems. I obtained a PhD degree in Computer Science from the University of Iowa in 2007. Since then, I worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Max-Planck institute for informatics in Germany, and at the centre for Discrete Mathematics and Applications at the University of Warwick. I also worked briefly at TCS Innovation labs before joining IIIT in 2012.
