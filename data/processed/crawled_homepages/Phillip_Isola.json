Previously, I spent a year as a visiting research scientist at OpenAI, and before that I was a postdoctoral scholar with Alyosha Efros in the EECS department at UC Berkeley. I completed my Ph.D. in Brain & Cognitive Sciences at MIT, under the supervision of Ted Adelson, where I also frequently worked with Aude Oliva. I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Yale, where I got my start on research working with Brian Scholl. A longer bio is here.

Lots of things have happened since we started thinking about this book in November 2010; yes, it has taken us more than 10 years to write this book. Our initial goal was to write a large book that provided a good coverage of the field. Unfortunately, the field of computer vision is just too large for that. So, we decided to write a small book instead, limiting each chapter to no more than five pages. Writing a short book was perfect because we did not have time to write a long book and you did not have time to read it. Unfortunately, we have failed at that goal, too. This book covers foundational topics within computer vision, with an image processing and machine learning perspective. The audience is undergraduate and graduate students who are entering the field, but we hope experienced practitioners will find the book valuable as well. Foundations of Computer Vision Antonio Torralba, Phillip Isola, William F. Freeman MIT Press Free online version of the book: visionbook.mit.edu Research Group The goal of our group is to scientifically understand intelligence. We are especially interested in human-like intelligence, which to us means intelligence that is built out of deep nets, is highly adaptive and general-purpose, and is emergent from embodied interactions in rich ecosystems. Questions we are currently studying include the following, which you can click on to expand: ▸ Deep representation learning: What kinds of representations do deep nets learn? Why are these representations effective, and how are they limited? Representative projects: Platonic Representation Hypothesis, Low-rank bias, Understanding contrastive learning ▸ Generative intelligence: How can we use generative models as mental simulation engines, supporting learning, inference, and control? Representative projects: Learning from models, Learning from NeRFs, Denoised world models ▸ World representations for agents: How should an intelligent agent, such as a robot, represent the environment around it? Representative projects: F3RM, Embodied representation learning, Mental imagery for robots ▸ Emergent intelligence: How can intelligence emerge from \"scratch\", without imitating another intelligence's cultural artifacts? Representative projects: Learning without data, Neural MMO, PowderWorld Our goal in studying these questions is to help equip the world with the tools necessary to bring about a positive integration of AI into society; to understand intelligence so we can prevent its harms and to reap its benefits. The lab is part of the broader Embodied Intelligence and Visual Computing research communities at MIT.
