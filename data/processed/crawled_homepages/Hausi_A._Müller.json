We developed (1) the concept of Personal Context Sphere (PCS), (2) the context management infrastructure SmarterContext, and (3) the SmarterDeals recommendation engine for electronic commerce. For PCS and SmarterContext, we won the 2011 IBM Canada CAS Research Project of the Year Award. For SmarterDeals we won the CASCON 2012 Best Paper Award. Villegasâ dissertation on Situation-Aware Smart Software Systems was nominated for the Governor General's Gold Medal, CAGS/UMI Distinguished Dissertation Award, and ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award.>/p>h Software engineering for self-adaptive systems (SAS) We contributed several innovative frameworks, reference models, architectures, methods and algorithms in SAS. I am a founder of the ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Software Engineering for Self-Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems (SEAMS). I was General Chair for SEAMS 2012 in ZÃ¼rich. I co-organized three international workshops on Engineering Adaptive Software Systems (EASSy 2013 and EASSy 2015) in Shonan, Japan and Software Engineering for Self-Adaptive Systems (SEfSAS 2013) in Dagstuhl, Germany. In 2017, I am co-organizing SENCPS, an NII Shonan Meeting on Software Engineering and Networked Control for Smart Cyber Physical Systems. Our SAS research contributions include our (1) framework for evaluating quality-driven SAS, (2) DYNAMICO reference model, (3) classification of SAS problems to guarantee solution qualities, and (4) frameworks for context-aware applications. Ground-breaking SAS evaluation framework sResearchers proposed many diverse software approaches and strategies to modify the behaviour of a managed system. In our paper entitled âA Framework for Evaluating Quality-Driven Self-Adaptive Software Systems,â we proposed a classification of self-adaptive systems spanning the spectrum from control-based to software engineering-based approaches. This SAS evaluation framework is based on our survey of self-adaptive systems papers and a set of adaptation properties derived from control theory. We mapped these properties to measurable software quality attributes. This framework is highly useful for architects and designers of self-adaptive systems. Many researchers in the SAS research community have used this paper to assess their own proposed architectures. DYNAMICO reference model Our 2013 DYNAMICO paper is ground-breaking and has been used by other research groups. DYNAMICO improves the engineering of self-adaptive systems by addressing (i) the management of adaptation properties and goals as control objectives; (ii) the separation of concerns among feedback loops; and (iii) the management of dynamic context as an independent control function. Our 2013 paper âImproving Context-awareness in Self-adaptation using DYNAMICOâ presents a realization of DYNAMICO comprising our SmarterContext monitoring infrastructure and the QOS-CARE adaptation framework in a self-adaptation solution that maintains its context-awareness relevance. The results of the evaluation demonstrate the applicability, feasibility, and effectiveness of DYNAMICO. Classification of SAS problems to guarantee solution qualities We collaborated with theoretical computer scientists, Srinivasan and Stege, to classify SAS problems. We observed that many SAS problems are solved using algorithms based on the Greedy technique resulting in excellent performance. In practice SAS operators adjust policies at runtime to optimize the behaviour of SAS. Research challenge: Can we identify SAS problems for which the greedy approach leads to optimal solutions? Our contributions: (1) A mathematical formulation for SAS optimization problems involving utility-function, goal, and action policies. (2) A mathematical framework that adds structure to the underlying optimization problem for different types of policies. (3) Evaluation of the applicability of our framework using real-world SAS optimization problems including resource allocation, quality of service management, and SLA profit optimization. Our innovative approach helps designers of SAS formulate optimization problems, decide on algorithmic strategies based on policy requirements, and reason about solution qualities. BSENG: Bachelor of Software Engineering I was the founding Director of the Bachelor of Software Engineering (BSEng) degree program in the Faculty of Engineering (2003-07) and the chief architect of the BSENG curriculum (2002-07). Personal I enjoy hiking and traveling with Ulrike, skiing with Curtis and Brian, singing and guitar playing, and playing soccer.
