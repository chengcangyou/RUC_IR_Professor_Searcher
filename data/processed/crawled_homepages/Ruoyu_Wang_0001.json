My research focuses on system security, especially on automated binary program analysis and reverse engineering of software. I am the co-founder and a core developer of the binary analysis platform, angr. I am a core member of the CTF team Shellphish. Sometimes I play with Pwndevils, too. I am a co-director of the Laboratory of Security Engineering For Future Computing (SEFCOM) along with Dr. Gail-Joon Ahn, Dr. Adam DoupÃ©, Dr. Yan Shoshitaishvili, and Dr. Tiffany Bao. Prior to joining ASU, I received my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I worked in the SecLab of UCSB, and was advised by two great professors, Dr. Giovanni Vigna and Dr. Christopher Kruegel. I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Software at Tsinghua University in 2013. I was a core member of the CGC team Shellphish CGC, with whom I won the third place and a lot of cash in the Final Event of the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge in 2016.
