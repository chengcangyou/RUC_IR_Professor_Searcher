I have developed a range of interdisciplinary collaborations, primarily in archaeology & history, with the Visualising Angkor Project, but also in Indigenous Studies with the Monash Country Lines Archive, in zoology, with colleagues at La Trobe University, and in ecology, working with CSIRO and the Australian Ecosystems Models Framework.Working with academic partners, I have developed a suite of four interlinked, practice based units in 3D modelling, 3D animation and virtual world building in the Faculty of Information Technology. Many of my approaches to teaching are informed by my own research into evidenced based historical reconstructions; where virtual reality and 3D simulation technologies are first trialled before being introduced into the teaching curriculum. This nexus between teaching and research has brought about new opportunities in the development of immersive, interdisciplinary teaching materials for humanities undergraduates in Australia and in the United States.
