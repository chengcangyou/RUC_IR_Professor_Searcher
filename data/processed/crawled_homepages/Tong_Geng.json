He also holds a secondary appointment with the Goergen Institute for Data Science. Before joining Rochester, Dr. Geng worked in the Physical & Computational Sciences Directorate at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), U.S. Department of Energy. His research lies at the intersection of computer architecture and systems, generative AI, and AI for scientific exploration.​ ​ The Lab: Dr. Geng and his students have published over 100 papers in top-tier conferences and journals across AI and computer architecture, including ISCA, MICRO, HPCA, OSDI, ICLR, ICML, NeurIPS, CVPR, ICCV, AAAI, DAC, SC, TPDS, TC, and TIP. The IntelliArch Lab is equipped with extensive computing resources, including in-house servers powered by NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, as well as access to over 20,000 GPU node hours annually on leading supercomputing and cloud platforms. The lab maintains long-term collaborations with industry leaders such as Meta and Microsoft through formal research partnerships and contracts. Its research is strongly supported by a diverse portfolio of funding sources, including major federal agencies such as DARPA, DOE, and NSF, as well as industry sponsors such as Meta, Microsoft, and AMD. ​Job Openings: Prof. Tony Geng will join Rice University in the 2025–2026 academic year and will no longer admit Ph.D. students at the University of Rochester. Interested applicants should apply to Rice Ph.D. programs. I am seeking two Ph.D. students and two postdoctoral researchers to advance Generative AI paradigms and their underlying computing systems through co-design across their algorithms and hardware architecture.If Interested, Read Me!
