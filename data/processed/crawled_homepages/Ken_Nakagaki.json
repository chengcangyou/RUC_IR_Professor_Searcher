I investigate the future of the physical environment and materials coupled with computation for novel tangible and embodied experiences. Currently, as an assistant professor at the University of Chicago, I direct Actuated Experience Lab - AxLab, where we invent and design the future User Experience based on actuated User Interface technology that shape-change and physic reconfigures. *Please visit axlab.info for the latest projects and news from my lab.
