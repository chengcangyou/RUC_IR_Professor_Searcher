Specifically, he is interested in deep learning methods for image recognition and object detection, efficient deep architectures and parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies, etc. Email Share Prior to joining MBZUAI, Professor Shen was an assistant research professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), China. He was a postdoctoral researcher at CyLab, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). Prior to CMU, he was a joint-training Ph.D. student at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and Fudan University. He was also an IAS Junior Fellow from the Jockey Club Institute for Advanced Study at HKUST. Professor Shen’s research interests focus on the broad areas of efficient deep learning, machine learning, and computer vision. Specifically, he is interested in deep learning methods for image recognition and object detection, efficient deep architectures and parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies, etc. Most recently, he is focusing on: (1) low-bit neural networks; (2) knowledge distillation for models and data; (3) designing and training highly efficient network architectures for CNNs and transformers; (4) un(self-)supervised / weakly-supervised learning; (5) image understanding including object detection, recognition, and captioning; and (6) few-shot learning.
