He received his PhD in Wireless Communications from the University of Southampton in 2008. Then, following PhD, he joined Imagination Technologies as a design engineer, where he worked on designing and developing a multi-standard communications software defined platform. In 2012, he joined the University of Southampton as a member of the academic staff, where he is currently a Professor. He is the recipient of several academic awards and has published a Wiley-IEEE book and in excess of 100 journal and conference papers and many patents. He has been awarded several funded projects by UKRI and by industry as well as an industrial fellowship from the Royal Academy of Engineering.
