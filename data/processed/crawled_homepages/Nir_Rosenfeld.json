My research lies at the intersection of machine learning and human behavior, including topics such as: –  Modeling and predicting human behavior and social dynamics –  Learning to support human decision-making –  Strategic classification and performative prediction –  Training for human objectives and with humans in the loop –  Implications of deploying predictive models in social contexts I am looking for strong, curious students interested in conducting research at the intersection of machine learning and human behavior. Before joining the Technion, I was a postdoc at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) at Harvard, working with David Parkes and Yaron Singer. I was also a fellow of the Center for Research on Computation and Society (CRCS) and of the Harvard Data Science Initiative (HDSI). I received my BSc (CS and psych), MA (CS), and PhD (CS) from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where I was advised by Amir Globerson. I was also a long-term research intern at Microsoft Research in Israel working with Elad Yom-Tov and Yishay Mansour. email: nirr at cs dot technion dot ac dot il Go to top Teaching: –  [236756] Introduction to Machine Learning (Spring 2021-2025) –  [236608] Machine Learning and Human Behavior (Winter 2021-2024) –  [236802] Seminar: Failures Modes in Machine Learning (Spring 2022-2025) Go to top Tutorials: Strategic ML @ IJCAI’24  [slides] Strategic classification @ ICML’24  [slides] Strategic ML @ WSDM’24 Papers: Machine Learning Should Maximize Welfare, Not (Only) Accuracy Nir Rosenfeld, Haifeng Xu preprint Strategic Classification with Non-Linear Classifiers Benyamin Trachtenberg, Nir Rosenfeld NeurIPS (2025) Evolutionary Prediction Games Eden Saig, Nir Rosenfeld NeurIPS (2025) A Market for Accuracy: Classification Under Competition Ohad Einav, Nir Rosenfeld ICML (2025) Learning Classifiers That Induce Markets Yonatan Sommer, Ivri Hikri, Lotan Amit, Nir Rosenfeld ICML (2025) Adversaries With Incentives: A Strategic Alternative to Adversarial Robustness Maayan Ehrenberg, Roy Ganz, Nir Rosenfeld ICLR (2025) Classification Under Strategic Self-Selection Guy Horowitz*, Yonatan Sommer*, Moran Koren, Nir Rosenfeld ICML (2024) One-Shot Strategic Classification Under Unknown Costs Elan Rosenfeld, Nir Rosenfeld ICML (2024) Instructed to Bias: Instruction-Tuned Language Models Exhibit Emergent Cognitive Bias Itay Itzhak , Gabriel Stanovsky, Nir Rosenfeld, Yonatan Belinkov TACL (2024) Decongestion by Representation: Learning to Improve Economic Welfare in Marketplaces Omer Nahum, Gali Noti, David Parkes, Nir Rosenfeld ICLR (2024) Delegated Classification Eden Saig, Inbal Talgam-Cohen, Nir Rosenfeld NeurIPS (2023) Causal Strategic Classification: A Tale of Two Shifts Guy Horowitz, Nir Rosenfeld ICML (2023) Performative Recommendation: Diversifying Content via Strategic Incentives Itay Eilat, Nir Rosenfeld ICML (2023) Learning to Take a Break: Sustainable Optimization of Long-Term User Engagement Eden Saig, Nir Rosenfeld ICML (2023) Strategic Classification with Graph Neural Networks Itay Eilat*, Ben Finkelshtein*, Chaim Baskin, Nir Rosenfeld ICLR (2023) * equal contribution, alphabetical order In the Eye of the Beholder: Robust Prediction with Causal User Modeling Amir Feder, Guy Horowitz, Yoav Wald, Roi Reichart, Nir Rosenfeld NeurIPS (2022) Generalized strategic classification and the case of aligned incentives Sagi Levanon, Nir Rosenfeld ICML (2022) Strategic Representation Vineet Nair, Ganesh Ghalme, Inbal Talgam-Cohen, Nir Rosenfeld ICML (2022) Strategic classification made practical Sagi Levanon, Nir Rosenfeld ICML (2021) Strategic classification in the dark Ganesh Ghalme*, Vineet Nair*, Itay Eilat, Inbal Talgam-Cohen, Nir Rosenfeld ICML (2021) * equal contribution, alphabetical order Learning representations by humans, for humans Sophie Hilgard*, Nir Rosenfeld*, Mahzarin Banaji, Jack Cao, David Parkes ICML (2021) * equal contribution, alphabetical order From predictions to decisions: Using lookahead regularization Nir Rosenfeld, Sophie Hilgard, Sai Ravindranath, David Parkes NeurIPS (2020) Predicting choice with set-dependent aggregation Nir Rosenfeld, Kojin Oshiba, Yaron Singer ICML (2020) A kernel of truth: Determining rumor veracity on twitter by diffusion pattern alone Nir Rosenfeld*, Aron Szanto*, David Parkes The Web Conference (2020) * equal contribution, alphabetical order Learning to optimize combinatorial functions Nir Rosenfeld, Eric Balkanski, Amir Globerson, Yaron Singer ICML (2018) Discriminative learning of prediction intervals Nir Rosenfeld, Yishay Mansour, Elad Yom-Tov AISTATS (2018) Semi-supervised learning with competitive infection models Nir Rosenfeld, Amir Globerson AISTATS (2018) We look like our names: The manifestation of name stereotypes in facial appearance.
