We show that separability problem of reachability sets of Vector Addition Systems by both modular and unary sets is decidable. Short bio Wojciech Czerwinski is an Assistant Professor at the University of Warsaw, where he obtained his PhD in 2013.  He has also been a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bayreuth.  His main research interests are in the areas of automata theory, logic, verification and database theory.
