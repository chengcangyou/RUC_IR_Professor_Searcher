My main research area includes computer architectures, compiler and runtime technologies, design space exploration, and parallel programming, focusing on designing extensible and efficient software stacks for modern heterogeneous systems (\"Systems for ML\"), and applying data-driven approaches to solve optimization problems of computer systems (\"ML for Systems\"). I received my bachelor’s degrees in literature and computer science from Seoul National University, M.S. in computer science from UC San Diego (advised by prof. Michael Taylor), and Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (advised by prof. Sarita Adve). I worked as a research staff member at IBM T. J. Watson Research Center from 2015 to 2019. Before joining SNU, I was an assistant professor at the department of computer science and engineering at POSTECH (Pohang University of Science and Technology). I am actively looking for outstanding graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral researchers for the projects listed below. When you contact me, please include an up-to-date CV and what project(s) in our group you are interested in.My CV can be found here. StudentsYongwon Shin  🏠Integrated MS/PhD Studentywshin@postech.ac.krHeterogeneous System CompilersJuseong ParkIntegrated MS/PhD Studentwntjd9805@gmail.comDeep Learning CompilersYoonho Choi  🏠PhD Studentyoonhochoi@postech.ac.krDSL Compiler OptimizationJeongho LeeMS Studentjh.lee@postech.ac.krCompiler OptimizationDookyung Kang 🏠MS Studentst00ne@snu.ac.krHeterogeneous System CompilersYejin Hwang MS Studentyejhw@snu.ac.krQuery OptimizationJinwook Yang 🏠MS Studentjimy1998@snu.ac.krDeep Learning AcceleratorJunghyun Lee 🏠MS Studentkevin0920@snu.ac.krDeep Learning CompilersJunseo Lee 🏠MS Student jseool@snu.ac.krML for System OptimizationMoohyeon KimMS Studentmh_kim@snu.ac.krLLM for SystemsSeonah YooMS Studentysa9171@snu.ac.krHeterogeneous System CompilersJaehoon OhIntegrated MS/PhD Studentehoonoh@gmail.comDeep Learning CompilersKyoungtae LeeMS Studentjeff8287@snu.ac.krHeterogeneous CompilersYeonsun HongIntegrated MS/PhD Studentyssseonyy24@gmail.comModel Quantization, LLM for systemsJeongmin Ha 🏠Integrated MS/PhD Studentjmha2021@postech.ac.krDeep Learning CompilersAlumniJueon Park (MS graduated in 2023) - Rebellions Inc.Jaehun Ryu (MS graduated in 2022) - Rebellions Inc.Google SitesReport abusePage detailsPage updated Google SitesReport abuse",
