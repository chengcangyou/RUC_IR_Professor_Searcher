Prior to joining UW-Madison, I was a postdoc at UC Berkeley and Stanford University, advised by Professors Anant Sahai and Sachin Katti. I received my PhD from the University of Waterloo, advised by Professor Tim Brecht. My research area is computer systems and networking with a special focus on wireless networking/sensing, and low-power and low-cost networking for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. My Curriculum Vitae (Updated October 2024).

The discovery of this loophole has led to several interesting studies that look at the privacy and security consequences: HotNets 2020, MobiCom 2022, IEEE IoT Journal 2023, IEEE Sensors Journal 2023 Learn more Automatic evaluation of RF sensors without supervision RF sensors are a key building block of a variety of wireless systems from spectrum monitoring to environmental sensing. We design systems that automatically evaluate these sensors using \"signals of opportunity\" without any human supervision: HotNets 2023 Learn more Low-power and battery-free networking for IoT Billions of new IoT devices will be shipped in the near future. To make them zero maintenance and to lower their environmental pollution impact, it is desirable to eliminate the battery or make their batteries last for tens of years. We have designed low-power and battery-free networking solutions for the 2.4 GHz WiFi and 24 GHz mmWave bands: SIGCOMM 2019, HotNets 2019, SIGCOMM 2020, MobiCom 2021 Learn more Publications A complete list of my publications can be found on Google Scholar.
