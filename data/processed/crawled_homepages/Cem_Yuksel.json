This is a series of mini videos explaining the setup I've been using for live online lectures and talks. It allows me to appear inside my slides and interact with them. Introduction to Computer Graphics. Recordings of my live online lectures are available on my youtube channel. Not all videos are online yet. I am adding them one by one. Short Bio I am an associate professor in the Kahlert School of Computing at the University of Utah and the founder of Cyber Radiance LLC, a computer graphics software company. Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at Cornell University after receiving my PhD degree in Computer Science from Texas A&M University. My research interests are in computer graphics and related fields, including physically-based simulations, realistic image synthesis, rendering techniques, global illumination, sampling, GPU algorithms, graphics hardware, modeling complex geometries, knitted structures, and hair modeling, animation, and rendering.

In SIGGRAPH 2024, we showed how hair meshes can be used for real-time high-quality hair rendering with orders of magnitude reduction in memory storage/bandwidth and rendering speed, rasterizing hundreds of characters in just a few milliseconds. High-Performance Polynomial Root Finding If you need to solve polynomial equations of order 3 to 10, you might want to check out my high-performance polynomial root finding solution and its C++ implementation. A Class of C2 Interpolating Curves Presenting a class of curves with a different (but simple) formulation than typical curves used in computer graphics and examples within this class that solve important and longstanding problems of C2 interpolating curves. Mesh Color Textures Mesh Color Textures bring the advantages of Mesh Colors to real-time rendering. Mesh Colors revolutionize texture mapping by completely eliminating its fundamental problems, such as the need for defining a mapping. Mesh Color Textures allow using hardware texture filtering for Mesh Colors, thereby achieving the performance of standard 2D textures! Stitch Meshes Stitch Meshes provide a new way of representing and modeling knited garments with yarn-level detail. We used Stitch Meshes for modeling full sizte knitted garments as well as various knitting patterns. This work will be presented as a technical paper at SIGGRAPH 2012. Open Source Code Base cyCodeBase is my open source code base intended for graphics programmers. It includes C++ libraries for basic graphics classes, and solutions to frequent graphics programming problems. More...",
