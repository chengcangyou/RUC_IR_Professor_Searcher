I have PhD openings in my lab for Fall 2026. I am always seeking highly motivated master students, undergraduate RAs, and interns to join our team at UMN CS. If you're interested, check out further details on work with Me My studies combine interactive visualization with interpretable machine learning to foster intuitive, efficient, and reliable Human-AI collaboration. My research contributes to innovative visualization techniques, Human-AI interfaces, and their practical applications (e.g., biomedical knowledge graphs, single-cell omics). My research has made contributions to visualization, human-computer interaction, and bioinformatics, as demonstrated two honorable mention from IEEE VIS (2022, 2024), one best paper award from IMLH@ICML 2021, and two best abstract awards from BioVis ISMB (2021, 2022). I am an awardee of the HDSI Postdoctoral Research Fund and my research has been covered by MIT News and Nature Technology Features. I actively contribute to the academic community by serving, including as General Chair for ISMB BioVis, VisNotes and Poster Chair for IEEE PacificVis, and as a Program Committee member for both IEEE VIS, ACM CHI, and ACM IUI.
