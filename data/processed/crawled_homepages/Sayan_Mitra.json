Research. Safe autonomy (e.g., self-driving cars, spacecraft, and drones), formal methods, distributed systems, programming languages, robotics. Biosketch Sayan is a Professor and John Bardeen Faculty Scholar of ECE at UIUC. His research is on autonomy spanning theory and systems. Sayan received his PhD from MIT with Nancy Lynch. He wrote a textbook on verification of cyber-physical systems (MIT Press 2021). The group's work has been recognized with NSF CAREER Award, AFOSR Young Investigator Research Program Award, IEEE-HKN C. Holmes MacDonald Outstanding Teaching Award (2013), and several best paper awards. Want to join our group?
