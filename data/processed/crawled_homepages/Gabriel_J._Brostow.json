You can also find me on Google Scholar, BlueSky, and LinkedIn. My group explores blue-sky research problems in AI, especially Computer Vision and Human Computer Interaction (HCI). My students and colleagues have diverse interests, mostly aligned around \"Human in the Loop AI.\" This largely fits in the field now known as Human-Centered AI (check out Ben Shneiderman's book!). I love this field because it allows us to apply our expertise to a variety of tough tasks. That includes assistive technology for everyday life, and super-tools for professionals making graphics e.g. film makers/architects, roboticists, or scientists studying people, animals, cells, or entire environments. I also have a special interest in authoring systems (for architecture, animation, presentations) that make the most of user effort. I split my time between UCL and Niantic, the company behind PokÃ©mon GO. At Niantic, I'm the Chief Research Scientist and Senior Director of the famous R&D Team. Before UCL, I did postdocs with Marc Pollefeys in ETH Zurich's CVG Group, and a Marshall Sherfield Fellowship in Roberto Cipolla's Computer Vision & Robotics Group at Cambridge University. I did my PhD with Irfan Essa at Georgia Tech, and my BS in Electrical Engineering at UT Austin. News: (Dec 2024) My students Skanda Koppula and Omiros Pantazis just presented their NeurIPS papers in Vancouver: Tapvid-3d: A Benchmark for Tracking Any Point in 3D INQUIRE: A Natural World Text-to-Image Retrieval Benchmark (Oct 2024) We had two papers at ECCV 2024 in Milan. Go Gizem and the team helmed by Mohamed! GroundUp: Rapid Sketch-Based 3D City Massing DoubleTake: Geometry Guided Depth Estimation (June 2024) We presented AirPlanes at CVPR 2024 in Seattle. (May 2024) Jess presented Don't Look Now at CHI 2024 in Honolulu. Congratulations on getting Best Paper Honorable Mention! Vacancies: Here are the vacancies in my direct âorbitâ, along with advice and personal opinions (not UCLâs obviously). And please note the action items for each! Just getting started? Please don't get one-itis, so apply to multiple institutions, and see my encouragment to persist.
