Comp, Department of Computer Science https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5316-6707 EmailFarid.Shahandehrhul.acuk TW20 0EX Personal profile Research interestsI'm a researcher in the field of quantum computation and quantum foundations. My primary focus is to study and characterize fundamental quantum properties and utilize them in quantum computations. I'm also interested in the philosophical aspect of quantum theory, including quantum measurement and the quantum-to-classical transition problems.TeachingMy teaching motto is \"learn it your way\". At the moment, I teach CS2855 Databases and CS1870 Machine Fundamentals.
