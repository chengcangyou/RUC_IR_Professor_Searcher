If you are interested in computer graphics and computer vision, please contact me. â¢ [July 2022] I served as the Technical Papers Committee member of ACM SIGGRAPH 2023 at Los Angeles, USA. â¢ [July 2021] I served as the Technical Papers Committee member of ACM SIGGRAPH 2022 at Vancouver, Canada. â¢ [May 2019] I served as the Program Co-Chair of Computational Visual Media 2022 at Beijing, China. â¢ [September 2020] I served as an associate editor for The Visual Computer. â¢ [August 2019] I left University of Leeds and joined Zhejiang University. â¢ [May 2018] I served as the Organizing Committee Co-Chair of Computational Visual Media 2019 at Bath, UK. Research My research focuses on the acquisition, reconstruction and generation of 3D contents in Computer Graphics and Computer Vision. My recent research includes 3D scene reconstruction (real-time dense SLAM, offline high-quality reconstruction, autonomous reconstruction with robots), digital human creation, and 3D AIGC. Biography Tianjia Shao is a ZJU100 Young Professor in the State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University. Previsouly He was a Lecturer in the School of Computing, University of Leeds, UK. He received his PhD in Computer Science from Institute for Advanced Study, Tsinghua University, under the guidance of Prof. Baining Guo, and his B.S. from the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University. During his PhD, he spent one year as a visiting researcher working with Prof. Niloy Mitra in University College London and four years as a research intern in Microsoft Research Asia. After that, he was an Assistant Researcher in the State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University.
