Professor Burns has authored/co-authored 581 papers/reports and books. Most of these are in the real-time area. His teaching activities include courses in Operating Systems and Real-time Systems. In 2009 Professor Burns was elected a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. In 2012 he was elected a Fellow of the IEEE. A small selection of published papers follow: A. Burns and A.J. Wellings, A Schedulability Compatible Multiprocessor Resource Sharing Protocol – MrsP, Proceedings of ECRTS, pp282—291, 2013. Author’s copy is available. This paper defines a new synchronisation protocol for multiprocessor systems based on critical sections being executed by any of the tasks waiting to gain access to the critical section. A. Burns, M. Gutierrez, M. Aldea and M. Gonzalez-Harbour, A Deadline-Floor Inheritance Protocol for EDF Scheduled Embedded Real-Time Systems with Resource Sharing. IEEE Transaction on Computers; available (FREE) from the IEEE. This paper defines a synchronisation protocol (DFP) for single processor systems scheduled by EDF. It is an alternative to the Stack Resource Protocol (SRP). A technical report is also available on DFP. A. Burns, R.I. Davis, P. Wang and F.
