My research interests span real-time systems, distributed systems, fault tolerance, reliability analysis, and scheduling problems in the cloud and cyber-physical systems domains. I completed my PhD under the supervision of Björn B. Brandenburg in the Real-Time Systems Group at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS) in Saarbrücken-Kaiserslautern, Germany. I also spent a year as a Postdoctoral Researcher at MPI-SWS, during which I worked with Jonathan Mace in the Cloud Software Systems Group, and two years as a Research Associate at UBC, during which I worked with Margo Seltzer. Prior to joining MPI-SWS, I was a software development engineer in the Cloud Networking Group at Citrix R&D, India. I finished my undergraduate studies from Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS Pilani), India. Most days I could be found in the ICICS/CS building (room 333) at UBC.
