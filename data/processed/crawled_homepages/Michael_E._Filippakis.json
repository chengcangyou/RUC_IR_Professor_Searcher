He continued his studies in the area of applied mathematics in the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) Greece where he completed his PhD thesis for which he received the state scholarships foundation award. For several years he was a faculty member (P.D.407/80 Lecturer) of the Department of Digital Systems of the University of Piraeus, Greece, where currently holds an Professor position. He has published several scientific papers in peer-reviewed international journals, book chapters and conference proceedings for which he has received more than 50 citations. His current research interests span several fields including Nonlinear boundary value problems with partial differential equations, evolution equations, optimization and optimal control, mathematical economics, game theory, simulation of communication systems and image processing.
