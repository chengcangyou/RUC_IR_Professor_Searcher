(Tech.), Docent in Statistical Machine Learning (Aalto University) Open postdoc and/or PhD positions in probabilistic modelling with differential privacy Antti Honkela is a Professor of Data Science (Machine Learning and AI) at the Department of Computer Science, University of Helsinki. Prior to his current appointment, he was an Assistant Professor of Statistics at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics and the Department of Public Health, University of Helsinki. He is the coordinating professor of Research Programme in Privacy-preserving and Secure AI at the Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence (FCAI), a flagship of research excellence appointed by the Academy of Finland, and leader of the Privacy and infrastructures WP in European Lighthouse in Secure and Safe AI (ELSA), a European network of excellence in secure and safe AI. He serves in multiple advisory positions for the Finnish government in privacy of health data. Prof. Honkela's research interests include privacy-preserving machine learning and differential privacy, Bayesian machine learning and probabilistic modelling, as well as their applications in computational biology and health. Prof. Honkela is an action editor for the Transactions on Machine Learning and regularly serves as area chair for NeurIPS, ICML and AISTATS. News Started as a full professor in the beginning of 2023.

Box 68 (Pietari Kalmin katu 5) 00014 University of Helsinki, Finland Software Differential privacy software on GitHub. My group's software releases on GitHub. BitSeq software for transcript-level expression and differential expression estimation from RNA-sequencing data is available as a standalone C++ package and in BitSeq Bioconductor package. The tigre package implementing the transcription factor target ranking method from our recent PNAS paper is available in Bioconductor. A Matlab implementation used to produce the results reported in the paper is also available. tigreBrowser is a web-based browser for displaying and ranking genomic modelling results. It allows easy viewing, sorting and filtering of visualisations of models from tigre or other tools. Older free software tools I have created are available on the pages of the Bayes and IVGA groups.
