For this work, he was awarded the prestigious ACM SIGSOFT Award in 2015. Also, he is a recipient of the prestigious National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award, which recognizes outstanding research and excellent education. Jones’s research contributions span the duration of his undergrad, professional, graduate, and professorial career. Throughout this time, Jones created tools and techniques for software analysis (static and dynamic), techniques to help manage test suites for safety-critical software systems, techniques to support several aspects of software debugging and comprehension, and has studied the ways that software behaves in order to better model and predict it. Jones received the Ph.D. in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, advised by Professor Mary Jean Harrold. At UC Irvine, Jones leads the Spider Lab and advises Ph.D., Masters, and undergraduate students to study and improve software development and maintenance processes. Jones is a regular author and reviewer for top-tier research conferences (e.g., ICSE, FSE, ISSTA, ASE) and has co-organized events such as the 1st Working Conference on Software Visualization (VISSOFT) and the 10th Workshop on Dynamic Analysis (WODA).

January 1995–September 1995 Research Overview The overall goal of my research is to provide practical, automatic techniques and tools that can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of software development and maintenance. In particular, my research to date has employed research areas of program-analysis-based software engineering, testing, machine learning, and information visualization to aid in the processes of testing and debugging. My research addresses the problems of software debugging and maintenance. Software developers commonly face difficulties in understanding, diagnosing, and fixing bugs in software. Whereas many software-engineering researchers typically attempt to create techniques to provide fully automatic identification and location of bugs, my approach to such research takes a different tack: My research addresses the large class of bugs that are caused by logical inconsistencies — an incongruence between the developers’ expectation of how the program should behave and the way it actually does. Such common logical inconsistencies typically require developer attention and comprehension, and usually are not amenable to fully algorithmic location and repair. As such, my goal is to assist software developers performing software maintenance and debugging tasks by facilitating their comprehension of the software and its behavior. In my research, I place a strong emphasis on practicality and efficiency — preferring potential real-world impact over expensive technical wizardry or inflexible, prescriptive workflow. I work to enable efficient and effective software engineering by assisting developers and researchers in their cognition of software behavior, with the ultimate goal of equipping them to produce higher quality software, more economically, and with less frustration. Fundamentally, the challenges of software maintenance and debugging are primarily challenges of human comprehension, e.g., understanding: where the bugs reside in the codebase, why the code behaves incorrectly, who are the developers best equipped to understand and fix problems, and when were the changes made that introduced bugs (and why were they).
