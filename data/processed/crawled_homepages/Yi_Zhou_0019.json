Prior to this, I was a Postdoc at the NLP group at Cardiff University. Before, I was a Ph.D. student in Natural Language Processing (a branch of AI) at the Computer Science department at the University of Liverpool, advised by Prof. Danushka Bollegala and Dr. Shan Luo. Previously, I received my MSc in Big Data and High Performance Computing at the University of Liverpool. My research mainly focuses on lexical semantics and responsible AI, such as ethics, bias and fairness in NLP. My research interests are broadly in natural language understanding, such as language representation learning, multimodality, commonsense reasoning, multiliguility approaches, text generation, interpretability and analysis of models. 🔥 News 26/09/2024:  🎉🎉 One paper is accepted at NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track. 20/09/2024:  🎉🎉 One paper is accepted at EMNLP 2024 main conference. 01/06/2024:  👩‍💻👩‍💻 I started working as a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at Cardiff University. 20/02/2024:  🎉🎉 One paper is accepted at LREC-Coling 2024 main conference. 07/10/2023:  🎉🎉 Three papers are accepted to EMNLP 2023 main conference/Findings. 02/08/2023:  👩‍💻👩‍💻 Visiting researcher at Users & Information Lab at Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST). 01/05/2023:  🎉🎉 One paper is accepted at ACL 2023 main conference. 01/05/2023:  🎉🎉 Two papers are accepted at Findings of ACL 2023. 01/02/2023:  👩‍💻👩‍💻 I started working as a postdoctoral researcher at Professor Jose Camacho-Collados’s group at Cardiff University. 06/10/2022:  🎉🎉 One paper is accepted at Findings of EMNLP 2022. 24/02/2022:  🎉🎉 One paper is accepted at ACL 2022 main conference. 📝 Selected Publications Junho Myung* · Nayeon Lee* · Yi Zhou* · Jiho Jin · Rifki Putri · Dimosthenis Antypas · Hsuvas Borkakoty · Eunsu Kim · Carla Perez-Almendros · Abinew Ali Ayele · Victor Gutierrez Basulto · Yazmin Ibanez-Garcia · Hwaran Lee · Shamsuddeen H Muhammad · Kiwoong Park · Anar Rzayev · Nina White · Seid Muhie Yimam · Mohammad Taher Pilehvar · Nedjma Ousidhoum · Jose Camacho-Collados · Alice Oh: BLEnD: A Benchmark for LLMs on Everyday Knowledge in Diverse Cultures and Languages, Proceedings of NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track, December 2024.
