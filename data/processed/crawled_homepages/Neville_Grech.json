My work in this area has been recently highlighted by ACM SIGPLAN and Communications of the ACM. I am also interested in the areas of energy efficient software development, smart contracts, semantics and generative programming. Some popular tools I have codeveloped include decompilers and security analyzers for the Ethereum platform (MadMax and Gigahorse) and Java pointer and taint analysis frameworks (Doop, P/Taint and HeapDL). Previously, I was Reach High Fellow at the University of Athens, a Senior Research Associate at the University of Bristol, and have worked in industry as a Data Scientist and Software Engineer. I hold a PhD from the University of Southampton.",
