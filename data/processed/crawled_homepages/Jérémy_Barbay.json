I am interested in other topics of research, in particular in applying information technologies to the education of humans (https://repositorium.cl) and other animals than humans (INteracciones Computacionales con Animales (InCA)). Since March 2023, I am working as an associate professor in the Department of Ingenieria Informatica en Ciencias de la ComputaciÃ³n (DIICC) of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of ConcepciÃ³n in Concepcion, Chile.

I am interested in other topics of research, in particular in applying information technologies to the education of humans through Learning Management Systems (LMS) and other animals than humans in Animal Computer Interaction (ACI). 2.1 Theoretical Computer Science (TCS) In the area of Theoretical Computer Science (TCS), I am interested in the Adaptive Analysis of algorithms and data structures, i.e. refining the worst case analysis over instances of fixed size n by adding more parameters to it, in order to intuitively measure the \"difficulty\" of the instance. The main motivation of this technique is that the gap between practical cases (real world) and the worst case (over instances of same size as practical ones) becomes potentially larger on massive data: refining the analysis by adding more parameters to it allows to reduce this gap back to reasonable values, by better understanding the particularities of practical instances. This concept applies both to the analysis of the computational cost of algorithms (leading to Adaptive Algorithms and Parameterized Complexity) and of the space usage of data structures (leading to Compressed Data Structures and Compressed Indices), and is pushed to its extreme with the concept of Instance Optimality, a property insuring the asymptotical optimality of an algorithmic construct over each single instance. 2.2 Learning Management Systems (LMS) In the area of Learning Management Systems (LMS), I created in 2009 the project https://teachingislearning.cl, where students create and evaluate educational material for other students; and in 2017 the project https://repositorium.cl, where computer science students develop education supporting software (e.g. Easy Program Checking, Easy Quiz, Easy Plan, Easy Oral Exam, Easy Written Exam, Easy Flip, etc.) based on the paradigms of collaboration (reuse of teaching material across institutions and time, e.g. Easy Written Exam, Easy Flip, Easy Quiz, Easy Plan), delegation (peer evaluation between students, e.g. Easy Oral Exam) and/or automatizing (scripts and artificial intelligence, e.g. Easy Program Checking). Some projects combine various paradigms at once! 2.3 Animal Computer Interaction (ACI) In the area of Animal Computer Interaction (ACI), I created in 2021 the project INteracciones Computacionales con Animales (InCA), where computer science students develop applications for non human animals in digital devices, in collaboration with researchers in ACI, so that to support the study of sensory and cognitive capacities of non human animals (always in a way which respects the wellness of the subject); and/or supporting human guardians to entertain, stimulate, train or teach to its non human protegees. 3 Publications I like to write, but I do not like to interact with the academic publishing system. You might find a pdf copy of an article in my publications folder, or on websites such as Arxiv, ACM, DBLP, ORCID, Publons, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, or Scopus. 4 Courses Ever since my doctorate I have been creating new teaching material and tools, and researching new educational techniques. Currently, I am teaching three courses: CC1002, an introduction to programming, using Python; CC3001, an introduction to Theoretical Computer Science; CC4102, an advanced course in Theoretical Computer Science for undergraduate and graduate students. See my Courses webpage for more detailed information, and in particular the list of courses I taught in the past with some statistics. 5 Supervision I like to work with students on topics where I bring the techniques (typically adaptive analysis in TCS and crowd sourcing in LMS) and they (or a co-advisor) bring the problems from a field I am not familiar with. I require students who wish to work with me to write their own proposal after we find an intersection between our interests: the idea is that this is their project, and that they must be the ones convinced that it can be done, so that they are more motivated to resolve problems on the paths to success than if the success is based on my own conviction that the project is doable. During the project, we have a weekly meeting time to assess the progress made and to re-evaluate the objectives of the project if necessary. I require the students to start their report at the begining of the internship and to submit updates in pdf regularly during the project. 6 Experience Period Title Institution Country 2023-now Associate Professor Universidad de ConcepciÃ³n Chile 2008-2023 Assistant Professor Universidad de Chile Chile 2004-2008 Assistant Professor University of Waterloo Canada 2002-2004 PostDoctoral Fellow University of British Columbia Canada 1998-2002 Ph.D. in Computer Science UniversitÃ© d'Orsay France 1997-1998 M.Sc.

(Maitrise) in Mathematics UniversitÃ© de Rouen France 7 Vita I was born in France, I worked 6 years in Canada, I currently live in Chile. I studied Mathematics, I established some expertise in Theoretical Computer Science (analyzing algorithms and data structures beyond their worst case complexity), and have been lately working on designing and studying new ways to learn and to guide learning, of both humans and non-humans: https://teachingislearning.cl (students create and evaluate educational material for other students); https://repositorium.cl (where various tools assists learning guides to design, share and reuse educational material); https://incalab.cl (where computer science students program computer interfaces for Other Animals Than Humans (OATHs)). I live with Lorenzo and Tina, two monk parakeets, and with Morticia, Boule and Gris, three chicken. We have learned various things from each other. I would like to (teach myself how to) design, build and study permanent cultures, including the culture of Other Animals Than Human (OATHs) in such designs. I list below some alternate, older \"vita\", some redacted in the 1st person and some in the 3rd person: chairs might find those of use to introduce me when I am to give a presentation. 7.1 Short vita, 1st person I was born in France, in June 1976. I received a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics in 1997 in Rouen, a Master degree in 1998 and a Philosophy Doctorate in 2002, both in Computer Science at the University of Orsay. I worked as a posdoctoral fellow at the University of British Columbia until 2004, as an assistant professor at the Cheriton School of Computer Science of the University of Waterloo until 2008 and at the department of Computer Science of the University of Chile in Santiago, Chile from 2008 to 2023. I am currently working as an associate professor in the Department of Ingenieria Informatica en Ciencias de la ComputaciÃ³n (DIICC) of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of ConcepciÃ³n in Concepcion, Chile.
