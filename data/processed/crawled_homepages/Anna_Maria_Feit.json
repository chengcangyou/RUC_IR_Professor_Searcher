Specifically, we develop computational methods to enable the design of intelligent interfaces that make optimal use of people’s abilities, skills, and experiences. Our goal is for interfaces to seamlessly integrate with our real world, as they adapt to a person’s environment, preferences, or cognitive capacities in a way that is predictable and adjustable by end-users.
