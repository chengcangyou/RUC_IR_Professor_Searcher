My research interest is mainly in geometrical computer vision particularly in inferring 3D information from images. I am also interested in general applications in video analytics and image processing. I like audio processing too. I obtained my Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University in 1999. My thesis topic was on reconstructing 3D large scenes from 2D images. My bachelor and master degree education was obtained from National University of Singapore, in 1992 and 1988 respectively. I was with the defence R&D for the Ministry of Defence of Singapore for many years before joining NUS. I also served a year in Media Development Authority as a Program Director in the Interactive Digital Media R&D Programme Office Prior to joining NUS, I was running the Signal Processing Lab, DSO National Laboratories Singapore. I am currently serving as the Vice Dean (Lifelong Education) of NUS School of Computing.
