Taylor Street, CDRLC, Room 5454, Chicago, IL 60607 email: stavros at uic.eduI am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago.I am looking for PhD students! If you are interested in (algorithmic) databases/data mining, computational geometry, or a combination of them please send me an email and consider applying to UIC.Prior to joining UIC, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Chicago and I was member of the ChiData group in the Department of Computer Science working with Sanjay Krishnan. I received my PhD in Computer Science from Duke University in 2020, where I was fortunate to have Pankaj K. Agarwal as my advisor.My main research interest is in the design of efficient algorithms for problems in databases, data mining, and computational geometry. My focus over the last years has been on developing i) algorithms with theoretical guarantees for practical problems, ii) indexes with small size that answer data queries efficiently, and iii) systems to check the efficiency and efficacy of my algorithms in practice. An important aspect of my research has been on combining geometric optimization with query processing. I am interested in Top-k queries, clustering, algorithmic fairness but I am also open to explore interesting new areas!If you want to know more about my work, please take a look at my papers.Here is my CV.I am fortunate to advise some highly talented and hard-working students.Google SitesReport abusePage detailsPage updated Google SitesReport abuse",
