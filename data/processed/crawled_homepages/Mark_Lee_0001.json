His research interests are focussed on Natural Language Processing. He is specifically interested in Sentiment Analysis of text, the automatic identification and understanding of metaphor and the effects of pragmatic inference in dialogue processing. More recently he has been investigating the extraction of constraints from text to build formal models for reasoning. His research has been funded by the Home Office, RCUK, European Union and various industries. For more information, please see Mark's personal homepage. Staff detailsMedia information Mark graduated from Sussex University with a BA (hons) in Computing and Artificial Intelligence and then completed a MSc in System Design at the University of Manchester before completing a PhD in Natural Language Processing at the University of Sheffield. He joined the University of Birmingham as a Research fellow in 1998 and became a lecturer in 2000. Natural Language Processing Professor Lee's research interests are focussed on the computational processing of natural language text. He has specific interest in: Sentiment Analysis Semantics/Pragmatics of natural language, especially figurative language Medical Informatics involving Natural Language Processing NLP like many other areas of AI has been transformed by the application of deep neural models and the use of such models to capture rich semantic information. His current interests are 1) in the theoretical understanding of what kinds of linguistic information can be captured, and 2) developing practical applications using these models, notably in healthcare and psychology.
