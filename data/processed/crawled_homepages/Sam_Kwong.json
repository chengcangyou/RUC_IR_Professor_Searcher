Before joining the City University of Hong Kong (CityU), he was a Diagnostic Engineer with Control Data Canada. He was responsible for designing diagnostic software to detect the manufacturing faults of the VLSI chips in the Cyber 430 machine. He later joined Bell-Northern Research as a Member of the Scientific Staff working on the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) project. Kwong is currently Chair Professor at the CityU Department of Computer Science, where he previously served as Department Head and Professor from 2012 to 2018. Prof Kwong joined CityU as a Department of Electronic Engineering lecturer in 1989. Prof. Kwong is the associate editor of leading IEEE transaction journals, including IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, and IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics. Kwong is actively engaged in knowledge exchange between academia and industry. In 1996, he was responsible for designing the first handheld GSM mobile phone consultancy project at the City University of Hong Kong, one of the largest. He has filed over 20 US patents, of which 17 have been granted.Kwong has a prolific research record. He has co-authored three research books, eight book chapters, and over 300 technical papers. According to Google Scholar, his works have been cited more than 27,000 times with an h-index of 73. He has been the distinguished lecturer of IEEE SMCS since 2018 and delivers two DL lectures yearly to promote IEEE SMC Society and cutting-edge cybernetics technology. He also frequently delivers keynote speeches in IEEE supported conferences. In 2014, he was elevated to IEEE Fellow for his contributions to optimization techniques in cybernetics and video coding.Kwong’s involvement in the multiple facets of IEEE has been extensive and committed throughout the years. For IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society (SMCS), he serves as Hong Kong SMCS Chapter Chairman, Board Member, Conference Coordinator, Membership Coordinator and Member of the Long Range Planning and Finance Committee, Vice President of Conferences and Meetings, Vice President of Cybernetics. He led the IEEE SMC Hong Kong Chapter to win the Best Chapter Award in 2011 and was awarded the Outstanding Contribution Award for his contributions to SMC 2015. He was the President-Elect of the IEEE SMC Society in 2021. Currently, he serves as the President of the IEEE SMC Society. He is an IEEE fellow and listed as a Highly cited researcher according to Clarivate 2022 highly cited researcher report.
