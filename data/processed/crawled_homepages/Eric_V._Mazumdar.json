I obtained my Ph.D in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley, co-advised by Michael Jordan and Shankar Sastry. My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and economics. I am broadly interested in developing the tools and understanding necessary to confidently deploy machine learning algorithms into societal systems. This requires understanding the theoretical underpinnings of learning algorithms in uncertain, dynamic environments where they interact with strategic agents--- including people and other algorithms. Practically, I apply my work to problems in intelligent infrastructure, online markets, e-commerce, and the delivery of healthcare. I am the recipient of a NSF Career Award aimed at studying the strategic interactions that arise in Societal-Scale Systems as well as a Research Fellowship for Learning in Games from the Simons Institute for Theoretical Computer Science. My work is supported by NSF, DARPA, and Amazon research grants. Prior to Berkeley, I received an SB in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) , where I had the opportunity to work with in the Laboratory for Multiscale Regenerative Technologies as well as in the MIT Computational Biology Group in CSAIL. You can contact me by email at: olastnameoatocaltechodotoedu I keep office hours during academic quarters in my office (ANB 216). I am available during this time for discussions with any students/postdocs who would like to meet. Emailing ahead of time to is preferred in case I am traveling.
