EUROGRAPHICS is the leading computer graphics conference in Europe. About I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science at New Jersey Institute of Technology, NJ, USA. My research in computer graphics focuses on geometric modeling, geometry processing, and digital fabrication combined with modern machine learning to create algorithmic solutions for digital content generation. Before joining NJIT, I was an Assistant Professor at the Institute of Discrete Mathematics and Geometry at Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien), where I also led the Computational Fabrication group at the Center for Geometry and Computational Design (GCD). From 2023 to 2025, I was a Visiting Professor at the Warsaw University of Technology and a Group Leader at IDEAS in Warsaw, Poland. Earlier in my career, I worked as a researcher at the VRVis Research Center for Virtual Reality and Visualization (VRVis) in Vienna, as a postdoctoral scholar at Arizona State University (ASU), as a postdoctoral associate in the Computer Graphics Group at TU Wien, and as a visiting research scientist at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). I received my MSc in Media Systems Science in 2007 from Bauhaus University Weimar in Germany and my PhD in Computer Science in 2010 from Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien) in Austria.

Topics My group conducts research at the intersection of applied geometry, computer graphics, and computational fabrication. We investigate problems in geometric modeling, geometry processing, shape modeling, physically-based modeling, and computational fabrication. Our work encompasses computational processing of geometry, development of efficient algorithms for shape optimization, computational shape analysis and synthesis, computational design of layouts and spatial structures, and, last but not least, interaction with the user. Our research aims to provide solutions for the generation of geometric models suitable for digital manufacturing. The goal is to help humans, particularly designers, specialists, enthusiasts, and inexperienced users, to create digital content in an intuitive and automated manner.
