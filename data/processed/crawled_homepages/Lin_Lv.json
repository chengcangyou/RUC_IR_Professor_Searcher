China Zip Code: 266237 Email: llu AT sdu.edu.cn or lulin.linda AT gmail.com [Bio] [Research Interests] [Publications] [Grants] [Activities] [Teaching] [Students] [Links] [Gallery] Bio Lin Lu is a professor at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University (SDU), and a member of the Interdisciplinary Research Center (IRC). She received a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from The University of Hong Kong in 2011. From 2007 to 2009, she visited the French National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology (INRIA) for one year. She received B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in the School of Computer Science and Technology at Shandong University in 2002 and 2005, respectively. Her research primarily revolves around computer graphics, with a particular focus on geometric computation in digital fabrication. She has published more than 80 research papers (including one highly cited ESI), one monograph, and more than 40 authorized patents. She served as the program co-chair for conferences such as GMP 2020, ICVRV 2021, and CSIAM GDC 2024. See more details in the Chinese version.
