My research focuses on mathematical properties of privacy, security and safety metrics and their applications. This includes: Quantitative analysis of attack trees and fault trees Category-theoretic and algebraic generalization of attack/fault tree metrics Information-theoretic approaches to (differential) privacy Optimizing tradeoffs between different metrics Analyzing and optimizing these metrics under uncertainty In the past I have also done research on comparative Indo-European linguistics, especially Albanian, and arithmetic algebraic geometry. My PhD thesis was on moduli spaces of abelian varieties. For contact details see here. Education Publications Miscellaneous I am one of the organizers of SENSEI, a yearly workshop on Safety-Security interactions (2024, 2023, 2022) Every year, I create problems for the Dutch Linguistics Olympiad. Here is a collection of the problems I created for the first round, and here is an article about the linguistics olympiad aimed at high school teachers.",
