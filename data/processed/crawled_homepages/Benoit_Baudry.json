I hold a research chair from the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP) and I am a Principal Investigator for the CHAINS project supported by SSF. I was the director of the CASTOR software research center from 2018 to 2022. My research focuses on software diversity and software testing to build reliable, web-based software applications. I perform experimental research based on the execution of large open source software systems. Experiments support sound science and close collaboration with software industry. Until August 2017 I was a research scientist at INRIA in Rennes, France, where I led the DiverSE research group.
