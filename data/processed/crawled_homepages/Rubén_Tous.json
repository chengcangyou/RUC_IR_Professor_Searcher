From 2022 he leads BIMAI, the Barcelona Image and Artificial Intelligence Lab. Previously he was scientific advisor at Adsmurai, associate researcher at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), lecturer and researcher at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF) and programmer at Cap Gemini Ernst&Young. He has published two books and more than 70 research papers. He is co-editor of several MPEG and JPEG standards and has been Co-Chairman of the JPEG's Metadata Group. He has been involved in 15 competitive funded research projects, including two European Networks of Excellence and one European Integrated Project. His current research interests revolve around artificial intelligence (AI), generative models, computer vision and computer graphics. He is also an independent artist and programmer (founder of the Liminal Labs studio), creator of the Lester rotoscope animation editor, games like Low Lands or apps like Napkinbox, and former electric guitar player at Bad Cover.
