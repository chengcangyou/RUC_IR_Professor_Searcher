I am also affiliated with the LinkLab, a multi-disciplinary research center for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). My research interests are at the intersection of computer systems dependability and data science. I am particularly interested in combined model and data-driven resilience assessment and design of embedded and cyber-physical systems, with a focus on safety and security validation and monitoring in medical devices and systems, surgical robots, and autonomous systems. I am a recipient of the NSF CAREER Award in 2022 and the William C. Carter Ph.D. Dissertation Award in Dependability in 2017. Before joining UVA, I was a research staff member at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Illinois, where I worked in the DEPEND group within the Coordinated Science Laboratory. I obtained my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Computer Engineering from the University of Tehran.
