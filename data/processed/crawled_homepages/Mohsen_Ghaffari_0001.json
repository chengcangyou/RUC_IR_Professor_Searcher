My research is in theoretical computer science, with a focus on distributed and parallel algorithms. Before joining MIT's faculty, I was fortunate to be on the CS faculty of ETH Zurich (tenured in 2022), and I received my PhD from MIT in 2016. PhD positions: If you're interested in working with me and my team and have a strong algorithmic background, please submit an application to our PhD program and mention my name. Unfortunately, I am not able to answer individual emails.
