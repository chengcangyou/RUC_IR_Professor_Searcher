The recent trend of large high-frame-rate screens, stunning visual effects, and physics-based animations has placed unprecedented pressure on the VSync-based rendering architecture, leading to higher frame drops and longer rendering latency.This paper proposes Decoupled Vertical Synchronization (D-VSync), which decouples execution and displaying in the rendering service. D-VSync allows frames to be rendered a number of VSync periods before being physically displayed on the screen. The key insight behind D-VSync to resolve the limitation of VSync is that, the decoupling enables sporadic long frames to utilize the computational power saved by common short frames, therefore providing a larger time window to tolerate workload fluctuations. Evaluation results of 75 common OS use cases and apps on OpenHarmony (Mate 40 Pro, Mate 60 Pro), 25 popular apps on Android (Google Pixel 5), and simulations of 15 mobile games show that compared to VSync, D-VSync on average reduces frame drops by 72.7%, user-perceptible stutters by 72.3%, and rendering latency by 31.1%, with only 0.13%-0.37% more power consumption. D-VSync has been integrated into HarmonyOS NEXT. @inproceedings{10.1145/3669940.3707235, author = {Wu, Yuanpei and Du, Dong and Xu, Chao and Xia, Yubin and Fu, Ming and Zang, Binyu and Chen, Haibo}, title = {D-VSync: Decoupled Rendering and Displaying for Smartphone Graphics}, year = {2025}, isbn = {9798400706981}, publisher = {Association for Computing Machinery}, address = {New York, NY, USA}, url = {https://doi.org/10.1145/3669940.3707235}, doi = {10.1145/3669940.3707235}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 30th ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems, Volume 1}, pages = {326–341}, numpages = {16}, keywords = {graphics system, operating system, rendering service, vertical synchronization}, location = {Rotterdam, Netherlands}, series = {ASPLOS '25} } SoCC On-demand and Parallel Checkpoint/Restore for GPU Applications Yanning Yang, Dong Du (#), Haitao Song, and 1 more author In Proceedings of the 2024 ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing 2024 Abs Bib Leveraging serverless computing for cloud-based machine learning services is on the rise, promising cost-efficiency and flexibility are crucial for ML applications relying on high-performance GPUs and substantial memory. However, despite modern serverless platforms handling diverse devices like GPUs seamlessly on a pay-as-you-go basis, a longstanding challenge remains: startup latency, a well-studied issue when serverless is CPU-centric. For example, initializing GPU apps with minor GPU models, like MobileNet, demands several seconds. For more intricate models such as GPT-2, startup latency can escalate to around 10 seconds, vastly overshadowing the short computation time for GPU-base",
