Short bio: I am an IACR Fellow I am a professor at Bar Ilan University From September 2022 to October 2024 I worked at Aptos Labs From 2019 to 2022 I was the director of the BIU Center for Research in Applied Cryptography and Cyber Security From 2017 to 2022, I was an affiliate member of the VMware Research Group During the 2011/2 academic year I was on sabbatical at Google Research. I previously worked at the University of Haifa, at HP Labs in Haifa and in Princeton, and at STAR Labs, Intertrust Technologies. Before that I was a Ph.D. student of Moni Naor at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Research highlights I coauthored results which demonstrated that secure multi-party computation (MPC) can go beyond theoretical exploration and be used for implementing actual systems. These results include an early system that used secure computation for running privacy preserving auctions (1999); the Fairplay system, which was the first system that enabled non-cryptographers to use generic secure computation (2004); the first design and implementation of secure computation of the AES cipher (2009); and many other results on improving the generality and efficiency of secure computation. I also made many contributions to efficient Private Set Intersection – PSI, and focused on applying MPC for privacy preserving analytics of very large data. In addition to research on MPC, I often do research on other aspects of cyber security. In a paper from 2002 we suggested to selectively combine CAPTCHAs in the user-authentication process, as an additional measure against dictionary attacks. (At the time of the publication of this work, CAPTCHAs were already known and were typically used for ensuring that only human users can receive specific services, but they were not used for protecting login attempts.) The solution that we proposed, which was new at the time, is now a common practice of almost all web services. Our work on zero-knowledge proofs for solutions of Sudoku puzzles is widely used to demonstrate the concept of zero-knowledge proofs. Our work on file deduplication in 2010 and 2011 demonstrated the insecurity of deduplication in cloud storage. Following our work on the security of the random number generators of the Linux (in 2006), and of Windows (in 2007) changes were applied to both systems to overcome the vulnerabilities that were discovered by us. A set of works on network security showed how different network fields, such as IP ID, and the flow label in IPv6, enable to run a cryptanlysis of internal operating system functions in both Windows and Linux/Android, and even remotely break KASLR security. As a result, both Microsoft and Linux twice applied patches that were pushed to all customers. Videos Some Youtube videos, including a recent talk on Distributed randomness using weighted VRFs, and old popular talks on Oblivious RAM - ORAM, ZK for Sudoku, Sigma protocols, and Private Set Intersection - PSI.
