In my research I build the computational tools needed to study and simulate these systems at scale; develop better ways to understand them using advanced analytical techniques; and work on relating them to practical sensing and engineering. I write about various topics in science, computing, research practice, and books, and develop software in (mainly) Python and Lisp.
