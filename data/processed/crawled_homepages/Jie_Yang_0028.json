I co-lead the Kappa research line on Crowd Computing & Human-Centered AI and manage GENIUS, the ICAI lab researching Generative AI development and usage in large organizations. Before, I was a machine learning scientist at Alexa Shopping, Amazon Research, based in Seattle, and a senior researcher at the eXascale Infolab, University of Fribourg - Switzerland. I received my PhD from TU Delft in 2017, MSc from TU Eindhoven in 2013, and BEng from Zhejiang University in 2011. During my MSc program, I also spent some time at Philips Research. I develop human-centered computing for trustworthy machine learning, especially for natural language processing. The underlying assumption is that to create AI systems that properly serve people, it is crucial to involve human stakeholders of the systems across their entire lifecycles. My research contributes a new set of human-in-the-loop methods and tools that leverage human conceptual and perceptual abilities for understanding machine decisions and for guiding the decisions to better align with human values. With such efforts, my utmost goal is to transform machine learning into an engineering discipline that gives humans full control of AI such that it can be reliably and safely used in various contexts. My research methodology is both empirical and theoretical, with primary activities characterized by the design, implementation, and analysis of human studies, computational algorithms, and human-in-the-loop systems. I particularly value the collaboration with scientists from other disciplines and experts from application domains, together with whom and my research team develop usable tools to make real-world impacts.
