Stout How to reach me Student Research Projects Research Teaching Tutorials, Consulting Past lives Affiliations Professor, Computer Science and Engineering, and Climate and Space Science and Engineering (curtesy appointment), University of Michigan. Research Interests, Projects, Publications Student Research Projects Here are some research projects for students interested in working with me. Here are a few quirky problems. Research My students, collaborators, and I most often work in parallel computing, using supercomputers for computational science, algorithms for abstract models, implementations and abstract models for some aspects of machine learning, and points inbetween. We also work serial algorithms; adaptive clinical trials and active learning; and random other things. The computational science work has involved small projects, such as ground water remediation, atmospheric modeling, and statistical imputation, and large multidisciplinary projects on frameworks for earth systems modeling and space environment modeling. Publications These were needed so that I didn't Perish. Here is an annotated list and my vita. Teaching, Students Some research projects for students, and some questions my students are working on, or have done in the past. Some of these problems were generated by the students and were far from my expertise. However, if you're good, have some initiative, and have an interesting problem, I can help you pursue it. I can ask many questions -- you need to figure out the answers and/or tell me what the questions should be. Some of my students. Classes taught recently: Algorithms (EECS 586), Parallel Computing (EECS 587), Theory of Computation (EECS 376), Discrete Mathematics (EECS 203) NOTE: EECS 587 is now designated as CSE 587, and EECS 586 is CSE 586. This is new as of 2024 and is causing some confusion among students trying to register Tutorials, Consulting Parallel Computing Tutorials Taught at U.S. Patent Office (USTPO), Ford Motor, NASA, and various supercomputing and parallel computing conferences. Here's an overview of the tutorial. Tutorials on Adaptive Clinical Trial Design Emphasizing their application to phase I, phase I/II, and ethical clinical trials. Here is a description of our research in adaptive sampling. Consulting I do consulting in parallel computing, supercomputing, adaptive clinical trials, and algorithms. I've consulted for or been supported by IBM, GlaxoSmithKline, Ford Motor, DARPA, NSA, NSF, NASA, DOE, DoD, ..., and my students have been supported by many of these institutions as well as Microsoft, Google, Intel, AT&T, JP Morgan, etc. I've also been an expert witness, on the winning side, and assisted with patent cases.
