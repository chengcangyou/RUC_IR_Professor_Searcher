Prior to that, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Hong Kong. He received his PhD degree from Department of Computer Science in the University of Hong Kong (HKU) in 2021, advised by Prof. Reynold Cheng. He once was a visiting student in the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in 2019, working with Prof. Xuemin Lin. Till now, he has published more than 40 papers in the areas of database and data mining, including one of four Best of SIGMOD2020 (a world flagship conference in database areas, 4/458), and most of them were published in top-tier conferences and journals (e.g., SIGMOD, PVLDB, and TODS). He was awarded the ACM SIGMOD Research Highlight Award 2021. He has served as PC members and reviewers for several top conferences and journals (e.g., VLDB, KDD, WWW, CIKM, TKDE, and VLDBJ). News I am looking for highly self-motivated PhD/MPhil students, PostDocs, and research assistants. If you are interested in working with me, please feel free to drop me an email. Please check the position info. Interests His research interests mainly focus on large-scale data management and data mining: Graph data analytics: dense subgraph discovery/search, (shortest) path query, motif analysis and graphlet counting, graph learning. AI/LLM+DB: text2sql, dataset search, vector search, table reconstruction. Traffic data mining: trajectory outlier detection, traffic trajectory search.
