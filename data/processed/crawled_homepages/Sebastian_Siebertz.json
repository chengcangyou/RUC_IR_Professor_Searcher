From October 2016 until September 2018, I was a Marie SkÅodowska-Curie Fellow (supported by the National Science Centre of Poland and the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie SkÅodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 665778) at the Institute of Informatics, Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics of the University of Warsaw. I obtained my Ph.D. in September 2015 from Technische UniversitÃ¤t Berlin, supervised by Prof. Dr. Stephan Kreutzer. My research interests include parameterized complexity, (algorithmic) graph structure theory and applications of logic to computer science.
