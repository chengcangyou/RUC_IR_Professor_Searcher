He did his BS and MS in Dept. of Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea in 1990 and 1992, respectively. He received his Ph. D in Computer Science from University of Minnesota in 1997. He worked for Intel Corp. as Server Performance Analyst till 1999. From 1999 till 2019, he was with Dept. of Computer Science, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea. He was a dept. head and a director of Center for File and Storage Systems Technology (CFSR) at Hanyang University. He moved to KAIST after 20 years of tenure at Hanyang University. He was awarded a number of prestigious and highly selective government grants including National Research Lab grant (2007 – 2012) and  Basic Research Lab grant ( 2017 – 2020). He was a PI of a number of nation wide government funded project consortium including “Developing high performance SSD controller” (2010-2015, consortium of five universities and three companies, KEIT) and “Developing the OS technologies for large scale NVRAM”(2012 – 2017, consortium of five universities and four companies, KEIT). He was awarded “Outstanding Researcher Award”, Hanyang University(2016) and “Gaheon Outstanding Research Award” from Korean Institute of Information Scientists and Engineers (KIISE)(2017). Funded by Samsung Electronics, he developed Namsan Filesystem. With Namsan Filesystem, he was awarded  “Best Academy-Industry Collaboration Practice in Samsung Electronics” in 2006. Namsan Filesystem was deployed in the commercial TV products. His work on IO stack optimization in Android platform identified the root cause of the IO inefficiencies in the Android smartphones (USENIX ATC 2013, best paper award). His work on IO stack design on the Flash Storage proposes a new way of designing the filesystem, block layer and device formware for the Flash storage (USENIX FAST 2018, best paper award). He is known for his work on the Android IO stack optimization, filesystem and block layer design for SSD and NVRAM. His research interests include Operating System, Distributed System, Storage System and Software support for byte-addressable NVRAM.
