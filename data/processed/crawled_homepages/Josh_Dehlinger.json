Prior to joining Towson University, Dr. Dehlinger was a Research Associate in the Charles L. Brown Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Virginia. He received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Iowa State University, under the advisement of Dr. Robyn Lutz, in 2007 and a B.S. in Management of Computer Systems from the University of Wisconsin â Whitewater in 2002. Dr. Dehlinger has taught courses in Software Engineering; Software Testing and Maintenance; Software Quality Assurance; Design and Implementation of Programming Languages; Mobile Application Development; and currently coordinates the Department of Computer and Information Scienceâs Internship program. His teaching interests include software engineering, programming languages, software testing, software safety and mobile application development. Research: Dr. Dehlingerâs main research interests include software safety/reliability, software reuse, software product line engineering, agent-oriented software engineering and requirements engineering. He has published research papers in ACM Transactions of Software Engineering and Methodology, the Automated Software Engineering Journal and the Journal of Software and Systems; he has also published/presented research papers at the IEEE High-Assurance Systems Engineering Conference, the IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering, the IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering, the International Conference on Software Reuse, the IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and the ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education. Dr. Dehlinger also has experience developing research tools and security tools for novice users. He has been the primary developer of SSVChecker, an Eclipse plug-in incorporating the results of several existing static analysis security vulnerability tools into an easy-to-use development environment lessening the expertise needed for source code security audits; and PLFaultCAT, a software product-line fault tree analysis tool enabling reusable safety analysis software engineering artifacts of safety-critical product lines.
