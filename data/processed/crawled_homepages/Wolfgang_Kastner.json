Office Hours nach Vereinbarung The Automation Systems Group (ASG) as part of the Institute of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Informatics, focuses on research in various topics related to distributed automation systems. Particular focus is put on factory automation, smart grids, home and building automation and their integration into the Internet/Web of Things (IoT/WoT). In addition, program analysis for real-time programs, formal methods for control systems and security and safety in automation are investigated. Current research topics at the group range from the comprehensive integration of heterogeneous (building) automation systems to smart home environments and applications. Within building automation, focus is put on the analysis and use of open standards, such as BACnet, KNX, LonWorks, IEEE 802.15.4, ZigBee, or 6LoWPAN, and automation systems integration based on management level approaches (Web Services and Service oriented Architectures resting upon e.g. OBIX, OPC UA, BACnet/WS). In this context, information modeling approaches with respect to machine-readable semantics and abstraction from heterogeneous technologies in the field and automation levels are developed. Applications of these integration and modeling efforts are, for example, better utilization of building automation for enhanced energy efficient operation in smart homes and smart buildings. In parallel, research and development efforts tackle cyber physical production systems, smart grids and the area of ‘Industrial Internet’.Wolfgang Kastner is the head of the Automation Systems Group at the Technische Universität Wien. His research specializes in the development of control networks and distributed automation systems with a specific focus on industrial, home and building automation systems, and smart grids, including aspects of safety and security. He is actively involved in the development of approaches and techniques for secure and reliable cyber-physical production systems, smart buildings, and smart grids, and their integration into the Internet of Things. He has contributed as a program committee member to numerous conferences and workshops, and founded the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society Technical Committee for Building Automation, Control and Management (IEEE-IES TC BACM).
