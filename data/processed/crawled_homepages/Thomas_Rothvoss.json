Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering University of Washington, Seattle Diploma at TU Dortmund (2006); PhD at EPFL (2009); PostDoc at EPFL (2010); PostDoc at MIT (2011-2013) I am part of the UW CS theory group and the Optimization group. Research I work in the intersection of theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics. In particular, currently I am interested in approximation algorithms, discrepancy theory and related questions in high dimensional convex geometry. Here is some recent work: Lattices. In [Reis, R. 2023] we prove that the volume-based lower bound to the covering radius for any lattice w.r.t. any convex body is within a O(log^3 n)  factor of the real covering radius. This implies that integer programs with n variables can be solved in time (log n)^O(n). Convex geometry. Schechtman posed the question whether the vector balancing constant of any d-dimensional zonotope is O(d^1/2). In [Heck, Reis, R 2022] we prove a bound of O(d^1/2 * log log log d) matching the conjectured bound up to a miniscule triple log factor. Approximation algorithms. For many problems, the naive linear programming relaxation is too weak to find good approximations. The Sherali-Adams / Lasserre lift then provides a systematic strengthening. For example in [Davies et al. FOCS 2020] we can use this method to obtain a O(log^2 n)-approximation for scheduling with precedence constraints and communication delays. Discrepancy theory. In the geometric setting of discrepancy theory, one has a concrete symmetric convex body K and asks for a minimal scaling of s > 0, so that the body sK contains a vector with {-1,+1} entries. In [Reis, R. SODA 2020], we considered the body K arising from balancing matrices w.r.t. the operator norm and prove that it must have high mean width. Then this implies a new algorithm to find linear-size spectral sparsifiers in graphs.
