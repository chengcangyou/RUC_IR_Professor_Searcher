I work in the areas of programming languages and software engineering, and I am interested in developing tools and techniques to make large-scale software more reliable, performant, secure, and maintainable. A list of my publications is here; also see DBLP and my Google Scholar page. Previously, I worked on applying PL technologies at Uber. I was the primary developer of NullAway, a tool to help eliminate Java null pointer errors with low build-time overhead. Before Uber, I worked at IBM Research and at Samsung Research America. Even before that, I received my PhD from the University of California, Berkeley. I am actively recruiting PhD students! Check out the RIPLE page to see the wide variety of exciting work in programming languages and software engineering happening at UC Riverside. Here is a keynote I gave at SOAP 2024 on some of my recent work: If you have a strong CS background and are excited about building tools to make software better and software development easier, please apply and get in touch!
