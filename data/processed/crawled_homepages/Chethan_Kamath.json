SHORT-TERM VISITS Simons Institute - Summer 2015 FACT Center - Summer 2017, hosted by Alon Rosen Charles University, Prague - October 2017, 2019, July 2022, hosted by Pavel HubÃ¡Äek [+] PUBLICATIONS Impossibility of VDFs in the ROM: The Complete Picture with Hamza Abusalah, Karen Azari, Erkan Tairi and Maximilian von Consbruch Preprint, 2025 [+] Synopsis [↗] Paper Problem: Can Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) be constructed in the Random-Oracle Model) (ROM? Result: Prior works [MSW20,GRY25] ruled out ROM-based computationally-unique VDFs with public setup. We complete the picture set forth by these works by ruling out ROM-based computationally-unique VDFs even with expensive private setup. On Verifiable Delay Functions from Time-Lock Puzzles with Hamza Abusalah, Karen Azari, Dario Fiore and Erkan Tairi Preprint, 2025 [+] Synopsis [↗] Paper Problem: Time-Lock Puzzle (TLP) and Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) are two central objects in timed cryptography. Constructions of TLP and VDF out there show superficial similarities: e.g., Pietrzak's and Wesolowski's constructions of VDF are essentially the Rivest-Shamir-Wagner TLP made publicly-verifiable. This begs the natural question: can one object be constructed from the other in a black-box manner? Result: The problem turns out highly non-trivial! In this work, we are able to construct a one-time VDF from TLP, but using the heavy hammer of indistinguishability obfuscation. Securely Instantiating 'Half Gates' Garbling in the Standard Model with Anasuya Acharya, Karen Azari, Mirza Ahad Baig and Dennis Hofheinz PKC 2025 [+] Synopsis [↗] Paper [↓] Slides by Anu Problem: The problem statement is related to that in [24]. Even though we showed that Half Gates cannot be adaptively secure in the plain model, can it be shown selective secure there? Prior results show selective security in idealised model, and this boils down constructing so-called \"circular and correlation-robust\" (CCR) hash function. Result: In this work, we show how to instantiate CCR hash function in the plain model using indistinguishability obfucation and injective one-way functions. On the Adaptive Security of Free-XOR-based Garbling Schemes in the Plain Model with Anasuya Acharya and Karen Azari Eurocrypt 2025 [+] Synopsis [↗] Paper [↓] Slides by Karen [↗] Talk by Karen Problem: A common optimisation applied to Yao's garbling scheme is the so-called FreeXOR technique, which allows skipping the garbling table for XOR gates. While selective security of FreeXOR-based schemes is well-studied (e.g., here) in the plain model (i.e., no idealised assumptions), not much is known about its adaptive security (where the adversary gets to see a garbled circuit before choosing its input). Result: Building on [18], we show barriers against adaptive security of FreeXOR based schemes in the plain model. In particular, we show it is not possible to lift selective security of several popular schemes (such as Two Halves garbling) to adaptive security while avoiding an exponential loss in security. Batch Proofs are Statistically Hiding with Nir Bitansky, Omer Paneth, Ron Rothblum and Prashant Nalini Vasudevan STOC 2024 [+] Synopsis [↗] Paper [↓] Slides [↗] Talk by Prashant Problem: Given \\(t\\) instances of SAT, the trivial way for an efficient prover to convince a verifier that all \\(t\\) instances are satisfiable is to send all the \\(t\\) satisfying assignments. Is it possible to do better in terms of communication? This is the problem of batch verification for \\(\\mathbf{NP}\\). Result: We show (among other results) that this is unlikely by proving that such an interactive protocol can be used to construct a protocol that is (statistically) hides information about the assignments, which is believed to be unlikely. (Verifiable) Delay Functions from Lucas Sequences with Charlotte Hoffmann, Pavel HubÃ¡Äek and TomÃ¡Å¡ KrÅÃ¡k TCC 2023 [+] Synopsis [↗] Paper [↓] Slides by TomÃ¡Å¡ [↗] Talk by TomÃ¡Å¡ Problem: A delay function is, loosely speaking, a function whose output cannot be computed faster even given parallelism. A verifiable delay function (VDF) is a delay function whose output can be \"publicly certified\" so that it can be verified by any party. Can we construct VDFs from weaker assumptions that those currently known? Result: We design (V)DFs assuming hardness of computing Lucas sequences in RSA group. Furthermore, we conjecture that this assumption is a weaker than the Rivest-Shamir-Wagner assumption, on which several current VDF candidates (Pietrzak's and Wesolowski's) are based on. Certifying Giant Nonprimes with Charlotte Hoffman, Pavel HubÃ¡Äek and Krzysztof Pietrzak PKC 2023 [+] Synopsis [↗] Paper [↓] Slides by Charlotte [↗] Talk by Charlotte Problem: GIMPS and PrimeGrid are large-scale volunteer projects dedicated to searching giant prime numbers of special forms like Mersenne and Proth primes. The numbers in the current search-space are millions of digits large and a participating volunteer needs to run resource-consuming primality tests. Once a candidate prime \\(N\\) has been found, the only way for another party to independently verify the primality of \\(N\\) used to be by repeating the expensive primality test. Can we do better? Result: We propose a practical mechanism for certifying the non-primality of Proth numbers. That is, a volunteer can â parallel to running the primality test for \\(N\\) â generate an efficiently verifiable proof at a little extra cost certifying that \\(N\\) is not prime. The proof is obtained by applying the Fiat-Shamir heuristic to our interactive protocol, which has statistical soundness. PPAD is as Hard as LWE and Iterated Squaring with Nir Bitansky, Arka Rai Choudhuri, Justin Holmgren, Alex Lombardi, Omer Paneth and Ron Rothblum TCC 2022 [+] Synopsis [↗] Paper [↓] Slides [↗] Talk Problem: In [11,12], we showed hardness of the class \\(\\mathbf{PPAD}\\) in the random-oracle model (additionally assuming worst-case hardness of \\(\\#\\)SAT). Follow-up works [JKKZ20,LV20] weakened the assumptions, but still rely on non-standard cryptographic assumptions. Is it possible to show \\(\\mathbf{PPAD}\\)-hardness from polynomial hardness of standard cryptographic assumptions? Result: We use the recent results of Holmgren, Lombardi and Rothblum [HLR21] to derandomise the proof of exponentiation protocol of Block et al. [BHR+21], which yields hardness in \\(\\mathbf{PPAD}\\) from polynomial hardness of iterated squaring (in any group) and learning with errors. Furthermore, we strengthen this to show hardness of \\(\\mathbf{UEOPL}\\subseteq\\mathbf{PPAD}\\), which is one of the lowest sub-classes of \\(\\mathbf{TFNP}\\). Practical Statistically-Sound Proofs of Exponentiation in Any Group with Charlotte Hoffman, Pavel HubÃ¡Äek, Karen Klein and Krzysztof Pietrzak Crypto 2022 [+] Synopsis [↗] Paper [↓] Slides by Charlotte [↗] Talk by Charlotte Problem: For a group \\(\\mathbb{G}\\), a proof of exponentiation allows a prover to convince a verifier that \\(y=x^{q^T}\\) for \\((y,x,q,T)\\in\\mathbb{G}^2\\times\\mathbb{N}^2\\). The existing constructions are either impractical [BHK+12] or guarantee weak soundness [Pie19,Wes20]. Can we have the best of both worlds? Result: Building upon [BHK+12], we show that this is indeed possible for `structured' \\(q\\). Moreover, we show that for applications, such structured \\(q\\) suffices. Limits on the Adaptive Security of Yaoâs Garbling with Karen Klein, Krzysztof Pietrzak and Daniel Wichs Crypto 2021 [+] Synopsis [↗] Paper [↓] Slides by Karen [↗] Talk by Karen Problem: Can the upper bounds for loss in security of Yao's garbling shown in [7,18] improved? Result: We show that this is not possible using black-box reductions by building upon the result in [16]. As in [16], we use pebbling lower bounds and oracle separations. On Treewidth, Separators and Yaoâs Garbling with Karen Klein and Krzysztof Pietrzak TCC 2021 [+] Synopsis [↗] Paper [↓] Slides [↗] Talk Problem: In the 80s, Yao proposed an elegant way to securely evaluate functions using garbled circuits. Is his garbling scheme fully secure? Result: Although security in a simulation-based model is known to be unattainable [AIKW13], we show that it is secure in the -- next-best -- indistinguishability-based model for some circuit classes. To this end, we use tools from algorithmic graph theory (e.g., treewidth) and circuit complexity On the Cost of Adaptivity in Security Games on Graphs with Karen Klein, Krzysztof Pietrzak and Michael Walter TCC 2021 [+] Synopsis [↗] Paper [↓] Slides by Karen [↗] Talk by Karen Problem: Are the upper bounds for loss in security established in [7,10] optimal? Result: We show that for certain cryptographic primitives whose security model involves the adversary constructing a dynamic graph -- like, e.g., constrained PRF and group key agreement -- this is indeed the case when restricted to 'oblivious' reductions. In particular, we use pebbling lower bounds and oracle separations to show fine-grained lo",
