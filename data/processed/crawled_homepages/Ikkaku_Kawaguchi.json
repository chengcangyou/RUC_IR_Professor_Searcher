He received BE, ME, and Ph.D in engineering from University of Tsukuba under the supervision of Prof. Hideaki Kuzuoka in 2008, 2010 and 2017 respectively. He also received M.E in Kansei science from University of Tsukuba in 2017. From 2010 to 2014, he worked for Panasonic Mobile Communications Co., Ltd.  Research InterestsWe aim to understands human characteristics and uses that knowledge to design systems that achieve advanced interactions. Especially, We are interested in \"Nonverbal Information\" which used in human-to-human communication, and design systems that achieve smooth communication by transmitting them. We are also studying real-world-oriented interfaces that use human physical behavior as an interface.KEYWORDHuman Computer Interaction (HCI) Human Robot Interaction (HRI)Non-Verbal InformationReal World Oriented InterfaceProjectsCommunication RobotResearch on communication robots utilizing non-verbal informationReal-world-oriented interfaceResearch on Real-world-oriented Systems using human physical action as interfacePublications & AwardsTRIOS contactRoom 3F804, Building F, Third area,University of Tsukuba,  Tennoudai 1-1-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8573, Japankawaguchi[at]cs.tsukuba.ac.jpGoogle SitesReport abuseGoogle SitesReport abuse",
