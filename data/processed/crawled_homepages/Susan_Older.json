Smith College of Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University Contact Information Office: CST 4-131 Phone: 315-443-4679 (but you may find email more effective) Mailing address: EECS Department, CST 4-206, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY 13244 Research and Scholarship My areas of scholarship include programming-language semantics, logics of programs, formal methods, and information-assurance and computer-science education. I am particularly interested in the use of mathematics and logic to reason about complex program behavior, such as security and access control (my current work) or fairness and concurrency (my Ph.D. work at Carnegie Mellon University, long long ago). This theme threads through both my scholarly work and the courses that I teach. Educational Activities I am the program director for the Certificate of Advanced Study in Systems Assurance (CASSA). Current and Recent Courses Fall 2013: CIS 275: Intro to Discrete Mathematics CIS/CSE 774: Principles of Distributed Access Control Spring 2013: CIS 252 Introduction to Computer Science CIS 352 Programming Languages: Theory & Practice Last modified: Tue Jan 14 09:50:08 EST 2020 Susan Older / sbolder AT syr.edu",
