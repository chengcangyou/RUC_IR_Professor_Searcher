My primary research interests are modelling tools and formalisms for stochastic timed and hybrid systems (in particular Modest) and their applications in various fields. I advocate reproducibility in Computer Science research, via artifact evaluation initiatives, tool competitions, and standardised benchmark sets. I was previously a postdoc in the Formal Methods and Tools group at the University of Twente and the Dependable Systems and Software group at Saarland University, where I also completed my Ph.D. in computer science with a thesis On the Analysis of Stochastic Timed Systems in 2015.
