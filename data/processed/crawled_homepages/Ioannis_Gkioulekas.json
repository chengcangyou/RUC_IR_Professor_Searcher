Ioannis Gkioulekas - The Robotics Institute - CMU Skip to content Ioannis Gkioulekas Associate Professor Home Department: RI Office: 225 Elliot Dunlap Smith Hall Personal Homepage Administrative Assistant: Brian Hutchison Lab: Computational Imaging at CMU Statement Research Publications Students/Affiliates I work broadly in computer vision and computer graphics, but I focus on computational imaging: this is the joint design of optics, electronics, and computation to create imaging systems with unprecedented capabilities. Some examples include: imaging systems that can see around corners or through skin; passive 3D sensing systems with extreme resolution; ultrafast programmable lenses; imaging systems that adapt to their environments. Technical keywords that often show up in my research include: non-line-of-sight imaging, single-photon imaging, LiDAR, SONAR, interferometry, speckle, acousto-optics, physics-based rendering, differentiable rendering, Monte Carlo simulation, probabilistic modeling.
