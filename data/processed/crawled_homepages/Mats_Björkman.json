He received his MSc in Computer Science in 1986 from Uppsala University, and his PhD in Computer Systems in 1993 also from Uppsala University. Previously, Mats has worked as a researcher at the Swedish Institute of Computer Science (SICS) in Stockholm, Sweden, and at the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona.Mats Björkmans current research interests include computer network performance and predictability issues, and communication for embedded systems (sometimes called Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) or Internet of Things (IoT). One current focus is methods and methodology for delay prediction, another current focus is reliability issues (safety, security) for wireless networks. Application areas include industrial automation and health applications.
