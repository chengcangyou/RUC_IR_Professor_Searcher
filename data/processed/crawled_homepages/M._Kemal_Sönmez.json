Why quantitative and systems biology? Daniel M. Zuckerman, Ph.D., QSB Program Director The transformation of modern biomedicine into a set of increasingly quantitative and interconnected fields provides the driving force for the Program in Quantitative and Systems Biology (QSB) as a point of convergence for multiple OHSU units focused on the study of complex (patho)physiological systems across length and time scales. A systems understanding is essential for identification of emergent pathways in numerous arenas of bioscience: neuroscience, cardiovascular systems, metabolism, and oncology, to name just a few. The program aims to synergize research and education across OHSU, and with partner institutions, in the development and application of quantitative and systems approaches to a wide range of basic and translational biomedical problems. Learn more about the QSB program People are the heart of the QSB Program. Numerous faculty from across OHSU disciplines participate. See the full list of QSB faculty The program will be organizing events covering a range of topics on an approximately quarterly basis. Visit our events page We have gathered information from multiple education programs into a list of QSB-related courses to serve as a clearinghouse for OHSU-wide information. Discover courses and programs related to QSB The program provides annual financial awards to OHSU members based on proposals to advance the QSB community. Learn more about QSB financial awards News and announcements Applications coming due for QSB Awards of up to $10,000.  Submit by December 15, 2022! Learn how to apply for QSB awards Congratulations to the recipients of the first round of QSB awards!  Two proposals have been funded: Growing “systems virology” at OHSU through programmable RNA targeting - Dr. Lamya Benameur (Mentor: Prof. Arpiar Saunders) A one-day symposium - Pacific Northwest (PacNoW) Quantitative Biology - Profs.
