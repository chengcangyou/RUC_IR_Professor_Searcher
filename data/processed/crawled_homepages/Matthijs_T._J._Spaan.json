My recent research focus has been on developing reinforcement-learning algorithms for safe and robust decisions, such that we can make AI more reliable. Before, I was an Associate Professor in the Algorithmics group. Prior to joining TU Delft, I was a senior research scientist at the Institute for Systems and Robotics, Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisbon, Portugal. I have received a PhD degree in Computer Science (2006) and an MSc degree in Artificial Intelligence (2002), both from the University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
