I have led or been involved in projects originating from industry-academia collaborations on software quality evaluation, business process modeling, and system/software requirements elicitation. I have specific experience in supervising model-based assessment and improvement of software processes. My current research interests include internal and external software quality, software development methodologies, software measurement, process maturity, and process mining. I worked as an adjunct faculty for Software Management program of Informatics Institute of Middle East Technical University, in Ankara, from 2002 to 2006. I was a visiting researcher from 2013 to 2015 in Department of Industrial Engineering and Innovation Sciences of Eindhoven University of Technology where I worked on business process management maturity and its application to healthcare. During my academic affiliations, I have supervised 30+ graduate students in their M.Sc. and Ph.D. studies, outputs of which have been published in various journals and conference proceedings. I currently work as Full Professor at Computer Engineering Department of Hacettepe University.
