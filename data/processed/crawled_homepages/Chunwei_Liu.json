His research interests span compound AI systems, database systems, cloud/edge computing, and database benchmarking. He focuses on optimizing data systems for both conventional data analytics and emerging AI-powered pipelines. Chunwei develops privacy-preserving workload generation techniques for evaluating cloud database systems, collaborating with major cloud vendors such as Microsoft, Amazon, Intel, Meta, and Google. Additionally, he explores novel data compression methods for data systems and implements adaptive compression selection in both conventional and resource-constrained databases and machine learning systems. Furthermore, he is engaged in high-dimensional data analysis, with a particular emphasis on time series applications. He was a Postdoctoral Associate in DSG at MIT CSAIL. He got his Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Chicago, where he worked in the ChiData group. Chunwei has several Ph.D. positions available for the upcoming fall.
