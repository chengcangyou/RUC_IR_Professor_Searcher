Hi, I'm Sung-Eui Yoon(ì¤ ì±ì) and professor at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Sci. and Tech.) Currently, I am leading Scalable Graphics, Vision, & Robotics (SGVR Lab.) at KAIST. My research interests span scalable graphics, vision, robotics, and AI problems. I received my Ph.D. degree from Dept. of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill under the advisory of Dr. Dinesh Manocha and did post. doc at Lawrence Livermore National Lab. I also received my B.S. and M.S. degree from Dept. of Computer Science, Seoul National University. Here is my academic lineage. Fortunately, I received Outstanding Planning Paper Award at ICRA 23, Outstanding Navigation Award Finalist at ICRA 22, Excellent class at KAIST, 20, Next-Generation Scientist Award (in the category IT category), 2019, Technical Innovation, KAIST, 2018, Best Paper Honorable Mention at PG 18, etc. I am married, and have one daughter and one son (pictures). Job opening I am actively looking for self-motivated graduate students and post docs. If you are interested in my research areas, please feel free to contact me. Check out the current postdoc opening.
