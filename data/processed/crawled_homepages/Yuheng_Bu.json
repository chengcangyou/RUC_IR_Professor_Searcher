Before joining the UC Santa Barbara, I was an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of Florida. Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral research associate at the Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE) and Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I received my Ph.D. in 2019 from the Coordinated Science Laboratory and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Earlier, I earned my B.S. degree (with honors) in Department of Electronic Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2014. Research My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning, information theory and signal processing. I leverage tools from information theory and signal processing to develop theoretically justified learning algorithms for applications including watermarking for generative AI, fair machine learning, uncertainty quantification, and model compression. More broadly, the primary goal of my research is to lay information-theoretic foundations for trustworthy learning algorithms, particularly with generalization, fairness, and robustness guarantees. To Prospective Students For all students interested in our group: please fill out this Google Form. I will carefully review submissions, though I may not be able to respond to every email individually. PhD candidates: I am recruiting students for Fall 2026. I seek self-motivated students with strong backgrounds in machine learning, statistics, and information theory. You should be comfortable reading and writing proofs and learning challenging new mathematical concepts; in short, mathematical maturity is essential. Selected Publications Y. Liu, Y. Song, H. Ci, Y.
