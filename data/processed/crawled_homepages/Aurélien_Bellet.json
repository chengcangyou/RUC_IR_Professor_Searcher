Jan 20 1 paper accepted to AISTATS The Relative Gaussian Mechanism and its Application to Private Gradient Descent pdf (AISTATS 2024). I am a senior researcher (directeur de recherche) at Inria, France. I am currently part of the PreMeDICaL Team (Precision Medicine by Data Integration and Causal Learning), an Inria/Inserm research group based in sunny Montpellier. I am also an associate member of the Magnet Team (MAchine learninG in information NETworks) based in Lille. Prior to joining Inria, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Southern California (working with Fei Sha) and then at Télécom Paris (working with Stéphan Clémençon). I obtained my Ph.D. from the University of Saint-Etienne in 2012 under the supervision of Marc Sebban and Amaury Habrard. You can find more information in my CV or my LinkedIn profile. You can also follow me on Mastodon. My main line of research is in the theory and algorithms of machine learning. I am particularly interested in designing large-scale learning algorithms that provably achieve good trade-offs between statistical performance and other key criteria such as computational complexity, communication, privacy and fairness. My current research focus includes: distributed / federated / decentralized learning algorithms privacy-preserving machine learning representation learning and distance metric learning optimization for machine learning graph-based methods statistical learning theory fairness in machine learning applications to NLP, speech recognition and health Useful resources: metric learning book | metric learning survey | metric learning tutorial | metric learning software | federated learning seminar CC BY 3.0 | Design: HTML5 UP",
