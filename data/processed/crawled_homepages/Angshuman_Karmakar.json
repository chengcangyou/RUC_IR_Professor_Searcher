I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer science and engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, India. My research interest lies mostly on Post-Quantum Cryptography(PQC) and Computation On Encrypted Data (COED) which are currently shaping the landscape of cryptography and computer security. My work spans a wide spectrum of these fields such as developing theoretical instruments for efficient scheme design, designing algorithms for efficient implementation, discovering side-channel, fault, and microarchitectural attacks, and proposing countermeasures. I have a vast collaboration network and I work with researchers and engineers from all over the world looking for answers to these extremely interesting and hard questions. I received the Erasmus Mundus fellowship for my doctoral studies at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven(KU Leuven), Belgium. I got my Ph.D. working under Prof. Ingrid Verbauwhede on the design and implementation aspects of post-quantum cryptography in the COSIC research group. I then received the prestigious FWO(Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek â Vlaanderen) fellowship for my post-doctoral study at KU Leuven. I am currently looking for motivated graduate students and postdocs to work with me on the problems mentioned above. Contact me if you are interested in exploring this exciting world of cryptography and computer security with me.
