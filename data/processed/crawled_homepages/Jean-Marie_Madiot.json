Before that, between August 2015 and December 2016, I was a postdoc in Princeton University; I worked with Andrew Appel in the Verified Software Toolchain project, focusing on verified reasoning on concurrent C programs. Between March and August 2015, I was an invited researcher in Microsoft Research Cambridge, UK, working with Nick Benton on program logics. I defended my PhD on concurrency theory on March 31st 2015 in Lyon, France. Pop science talk about proofs and programs I gave at Institut Henri PoincarÃ© for Maths en mouvements: \"Des programmes sans bugs grÃ¢ce aux mathÃ©matiques formelles ?\" Formalizing 100 theorems: as of November 2022, 79% completed in Rocq (Coq) Contact jean-marie.madiot (at) inria.fr +33 1 80 49 41 89 Jean-Marie Madiot INRIA Paris 48 rue Barrault CS 61534 75647 PARIS CEDEX France Office BJ27 Publications A separation logic for heap space under garbage collection (at POPL 2022) with FranÃ§ois Pottier Modular coinduction up-to for higher-order languages via first-order transition systems (in LMCS, 2021) with Damien Pous and Davide Sangiorgi Name-passing calculi: from fusions to preorders and types (in Information and Computation, 2016) with Daniel Hirschkoff and Davide Sangiorgi A behavioural theory for a Ï-calculus with preorders (in Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming, 2015) with Daniel Hirschkoff and Xian Xu A behavioural theory for a Ï-calculus with preorders (at FSEN 2015, best paper award) with Daniel Hirschkoff and Xian Xu Symmetries and Dualities in Name-Passing Process Calculi (in Computing with New Resources, 2014) with Daniel Hirschkoff and Davide Sangiorgi Bisimulations up-to: beyond first-order transition systems (at CONCUR 2014) with Damien Pous and Davide Sangiorgi Name-passing calculi: from fusions to preorders and types (at LICS 2013) with Daniel Hirschkoff and Davide Sangiorgi Duality and i/o-types in the Ï-calculus (at CONCUR 2012) with Daniel Hirschkoff and Davide Sangiorgi PhD I have a PhD in computer science from ENS Lyon and the University of Bologna, my advisors were Daniel Hirschkoff and Davide Sangiorgi. I conducted an investigation of types and duality in process calculi, and I provided bisimulation techniques for a variety of core higher-order languages (functional, imperative, and concurrent).
