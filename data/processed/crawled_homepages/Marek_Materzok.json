One of them, register transfer level (RTL), requires specifying each and every component in the designed circuit. This gives the designer full control, but burdens the designer with many trivial details. The other, the high-level synthesis (HLS) method, allows the designer to abstract the details of hardware away and focus on the problem being solved. This method however cannot be used for a class of hardware design problems because the circuit's clock is also abstracted away. We present YieldFSM, a hardware description language that uses the generator abstraction to represent clock-level timing in a digital circuit. It represents a middle ground between the RTL and HLS approaches: the abstraction level is higher than in RTL, but thanks to explicit information about clock-level timing, it can be used in applications where RTL is traditionally used. We also present the YieldFSM compiler, which uses methods developed by the functional programming community ś including continuation-passsing style translation and defunctionalization ś to translate YieldFSM programs to Mealy machines. It is implemented using Template Haskell and the Clash functional hardware description language. We show that this approach leads to short and conceptually simple hardware descriptions. CCS Concepts: • Hardware → Hardware description languages and compilation; • Software and its engineering → Domain specific languages; Control structures.Download Easyprove: a tool for teaching precise reasoningArXiv, 2015Teaching precise mathematical reasoning can be very hard.

It is very easy for a student to make a subtle mistake in a proof which invalidates it, but it is often hard for the teacher to pinpoint and explain the problem in the (often chaotically written) student&#39;s proof. We present Easyprove, an interactive proof assistant aimed at first year computer science students and high school students, intended as a supplementary tool for teaching logical reasoning. The system is a Web application with a natural, mouse-oriented user interface.Download Certified Desugaring of Javascript Programs using Coq Experience ReportJavaScript is a programming language originally developed for client-side scripting in Web browse... more JavaScript is a programming language originally developed for client-side scripting in Web browsers; its use evolved from simple scripts to complex Web applications. It has also found use in mobile applications, server-side network programming, and databases. A number of semantics were developed for the JavaScript language. We are specifically interested in two of them: JSCert and JS. In order to increase our confidence that the two semantics correctly model JavaScript, we try to relate them formally using Coq. The size and complexity of the two semantics makes this a complex problem with many obstacles to be overcome.Download DigitalJSProceedings of the 8th Computer Science Education Research Conference on ZZZ Proving termination of evaluation for System F with control operatorsby Malgorzata Biernacka and Marek MaterzokElectronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science, 2013We present new proofs of termination of evaluation in reduction semantics (i.e., a small-step ope... more We present new proofs of termination of evaluation in reduction semantics (i.e., a small-step operational semantics with explicit representation of evaluation contexts) for System F with control operators. We introduce a modified version of Girard's proof method based on reducibility candidates, where the reducibility predicates are defined on values and on evaluation contexts as prescribed by the reduction semantics format. We address both abortive control operators (callcc) and delimitedcontrol operators (shift and reset) for which we introduce novel polymorphic type systems, and we consider both the call-by-value and call-by-name evaluation strategies.Download Easyprove: a tool for teaching precise reasoningTeaching precise mathematical reasoning can be very hard.

For each of the calculi we present a set of axioms that we prove sound and complete with respect to the corresponding CPS translation.arrow_back_iosarrow_forward_iosDownload A Dynamic Interpretation of the CPS HierarchyLecture Notes in Computer Science, 2012The CPS hierarchy of control operators shifti/reseti of Danvy and Fil- inski is a natural general... more The CPS hierarchy of control operators shifti/reseti of Danvy and Fil- inski is a natural generalization of the shift and reset static control operators that allow for abstracting delimited control in a structured and CPS-guided manner.

We exploit this generalization by considering the control operators known as shift0 and reset0 that can access arbitrary contexts in the metacontext.
