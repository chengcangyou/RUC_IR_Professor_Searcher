A central theme of my work is building methods with rigorous guarantees that can be applied to engineering and scientific problems motivated by real-world applications. I am particularly interested in generative modeling for high-dimensional and spatio-temporal data, including flow-based and optimal transport–inspired approaches, as well as their applications in robust learning and simulation. My research also covers sequential data analysis and change-point detection, distributionally robust optimization, and statistical inference for machine learning models. These directions aim to bridge theory and practice by advancing foundational methods while addressing pressing challenges in areas such as power systems, public safety, and healthcare.

Articles covering my research at Inside Higher Ed, at GT In pursuit of better data forecasting,\" \"Driving data science innovation as Coca-Cola Foundation Chair\", and \"Finding Clarity in the Noise: A New Way to Recover Hidden Signals at the Nanoscale.\" In 2022, I am humbled and honored to receive the prestigious INFORMS Donald P. Gaver, Jr. Early Career Award for Excellence in Operations Research, which is awarded to one recipient across INFORMS annually. Citation: \"For outstanding research contributions at the interface of operations research, statistics, machine learning and optimization; for successfully applying her research talent to applications of societal importance; and for contributions to the education and mentoring of students at all levels.\" Here is my acceptance speech and picture at INFORMS Award Ceremony, Oct. 2022 with (a subset) of my (current and former) students. In 2024, I am honored and humbled to receive the CWS Woodroofe Award, presented at the Joint Statistical Meeting (JSM) 2024 (a picture at the award ceremony).
