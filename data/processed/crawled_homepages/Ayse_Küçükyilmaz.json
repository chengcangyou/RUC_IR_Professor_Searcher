Her research interests include haptics, physical HRI, assistive robotics, and machine learning. Previously, she was a senior lecturer and a member of the Lincoln Centre for Autonomous Systems (L-CAS) at the School of Computer Science in University of Lincoln, UK. Between 2015 and 2017, she worked as an assistant professor at the Department of Computer Engineering at Yeditepe University. Prior to that, Ayse worked as a postdoctoral research associate at the Personal Robotics Laboratory of Imperial College London. She was a visiting researcher at the Information-Oriented Control group in Technical University of Munich in 2011. Ayse received her Ph.D. in Computational Sciences and Engineering from Koc University, Turkey in 2013, and obtained her B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Computer Engineering from Bilkent University, Turkey. She was the recipient of the Academic Excellence Award at her graduation from Koc University in 2013 and the 2016 Meritorious Service Award for her work as a reviewer for the IEEE Transactions on Haptics. She has received individual fellowships from Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions and TUBITAK.Expertise SummaryMy research focus is in haptic shared control for physical human-robot interaction (pHRI). My aim is to build adjustable autonomy paradigms to enable dynamic switching behaviours between different levels of robotic autonomy (e.g. full human control vs. full autonomy) during shared control of a physical task.Recent Publications A.
