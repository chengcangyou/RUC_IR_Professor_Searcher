I am an assistant professor at the Khoury College of Computer Science at Northeastern University. I am a member of the Cryptography and Privacy Group, the Theory Group, and the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute. Previously, I received my Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University, where I was fortunately co-advised by Abhishek Jain and Xin Li. After that I was a postdoctoral associate at MIT CSAIL, mentored by Vinod Vaikuntanathan. I received my bachelor's degree from Mathematics Department at Fudan University, and was advised by Yunlei Zhao. Program Committee: CRYPTO 2024, 2025, TCC 2023, 2024, 2025, PKC 2024, Asiacrypt 2025. Contact: zh.jin (AT) northeastern (DOT) edu, albusmath at gmail dot com. I'm looking for talented students to join my group!
