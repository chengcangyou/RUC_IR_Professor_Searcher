Interests Human-Cyber-Physical Systems Decision Support Systems Digital Twins Formal Methods Education PhD in Computer and Information Science, 2016 University of Pennsylvania MS.E in Robotics, 2010 University of Pennsylvania BS.E in Technology and Instruments in Measurement and Control, 2008 University of Electronic Science and Technology of China Experience Assistant Professor ShanghaiTech University Jul 2018 â Present Shanghai, China Director of the Human-Cyber-Physical Systems Lab Researcher Toyota InfoTechnology Center USA Jul 2017 â Jun 2018 Mountain View, California Project lead - Digital Twins for Safe Connected Cars. Research My research develops theoretical foundations for Human-Cyber-Physical Systems (HCPS) in safety-critical domains. To ensure safe and effective decision-making, two requirements must be met: (1) explicit mechanism-to-observation and decision-to-outcome causality; (2) real-time understanding of human operators' cognitive states and preferences. I propose a dual-digital-twin framework resolving these challenges: the Environment Digital Twin enables counterfactual analysis for causality establishment, while the Cognitive Digital Twin infers decision-makers’ cognitive parameters and predicts their responses to decision supports. This architecture enables AI systems to complementârather than replaceâhuman experts in medical and automotive applications, achieving safe and effective human-machine collaboration. Crucially, decisions guided by these twins ensure decision-makers operate with the correct contextual understanding, while the AI-generated support becomes inherently more intuitive, easier to accept, and ultimately more effective in guiding the human towards optimal choices.â Research Overview Projects * All Medical Automotives Uncertainty Diagnosis Formal Methods Clinical Assist System for Cardiac Ablation Iterative enumeration and update of suspected heart conditions can improve the rigorousness and efficiency of cardiac ablation.
