As such, I am a member of the Large-Scale Data and Systems Group. I am interested in all things data: analytics, transactions, systems, algorithms, data structures, processing models and everything in between. While some of my work targets \"traditional\" relational databases, my objective is to broaden the applicability of data management techniques. This means targeting new applications like visualization, games, IoT and AI as well as new platforms like compilers, GPUs or FPGAs. Before joining Imperial, I was a Postdoc at the Database group at MIT CSAIL. I spent my PhD years in the Database Architectures group at CWI in Amsterdam resulting in a PhD from the University of Amsterdam in 2015. I received my master's degree (Diplom) in computer science at Humboldt-UniversitÃ¤t zu Berlin in 2010. My Cloud",
