He received the MS and the PhD in Information Engineering from The University of Tokyo in 1999 and 2002 respectively. From 2002 to 2006, he jointed the Professional Programme for Strategic Software Project in The University Tokyo. Since March 2006, he has been a assistant professor in Creative Informatics at The University of Tokyo. His research interests include humanoids robots, real-time 3D computer vision, and recognition-action integrated system. He is a member of IEEE, Information Processing Society of Japan and the Robotics Society of Japan. [Japanese Page] Selected Papers K. Okada, S. Kagami, M. Inaba, H.
