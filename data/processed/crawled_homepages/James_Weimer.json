I am a member of the Institute for Software Integrated Systems, and the Vanderbilt Institute for Surgery and Engineering. I am the Director of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) Lab and the Medical Device Club. My research develops foundations and tools for safety guarantees and predictable performance of learning-enabled cyber-physical systems (CPS) - primarily targeting the internet-of-medical-things (IoMT) and autonomous vehicles (AVs). Specifically, my research aims to develop tools and techniques to address challenges arising from real-world data constraints, which can be caused by unmodeled variability, dataset shifts, anomalies, and sensing limitations. We seek to overcome data constraints by improving data generation through better experimental design, increased data efficiency, and novel analysis techniques. Find out more here.
