I apply data analytics techniques (mining software repositories) to study how developers use programming languages, to help gain insight into features they use and how they use them. I believe future programming languages can be better designed by leveraging data.I am also working on ARG-V and PAClab for automatically generating benchmark programs for program analysis researchers.I am a lead researcher and engineer for the Boa language and infrastructure. Boa is a virtual laboratory for data-intensive research on open-source software development. Boa provides better abstractions for easily and efficiently mining ultra-large-scale software repositories.Recent and Select PublicationsICSE: Boa: A Language and Infrastructure for Analyzing Ultra-Large-Scale Software Repositories Robert Dyer, Hoan Anh Nguyen, Hridesh Rajan, Tien N.
