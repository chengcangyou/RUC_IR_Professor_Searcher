Here is a link to my official university home page, which includes a list of publications. I am also \"studieleder\" (head of studies) for the BSc. programme in computer science at the University of Copenhagen. I'm working with automatic program analysis and transformation (in particular partial evaluation and program semi-inversion), reversible computation, compiler technology, domain-specific languages and occasionally dabble in algorithms, complexity, automata theory, fractals and graphics. In autumn 2011 Springer Verlag published my textbook Introduction to Compiler Design. This book is based on material used in the undergraduate compilers course at DIKU. An earlier version of this material (and some extra material) can be found in my self-published textbook Basics of Compiler Design, which will not be updated anymore and is only avaiable electronically through the link above. In autumn 2022 Springer Verlag published my textbook Programming Language Design and Implementation.. This book is based on material used in the course \"Programming Language Design\" at DIKU. Misprints will be listed here, as they are found. Application of CS to fun and games I have made a domain-specific language \"Troll\" for defining die-roll methods and calculating their probabilities. More information at the Troll homepage. I have also made a generator of planet maps. See more at the Planet page. Just fun and games I have made a guide for making braided Christmas hearts, like the one shown below. There are also specific instructions for a Venus-symbol heart and a recycling logo heart. A have designed a Fantasy role-playing game called Remnants of a Golden Age. It is a development of an earlier game I developed called Dark Coast. Inspired by one of my favourite games Britannia, I have made a Fantasy board game called Hy Breasil. When the study structure at DIKU was revised, I made a variant of Hare and Tortoise based on the new structure. The resulting game is Studiespillet. In Danish. Ages ago, on a challenge of designing a Chess variant on a board with exactly 39 positions, I made a very minimalistic hexagonal Chess variant.
