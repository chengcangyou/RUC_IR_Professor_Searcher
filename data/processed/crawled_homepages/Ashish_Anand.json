He did his Masters (Int-MSc, 5 years) in Mathematics and Scientific Computing from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. Thereafter, he joined Androgen Receptor Laboratory (University of Helsinki, Finland) as a visiting research student. That was the place where he got introduced to exciting biology compared to the boring school days biology. Computational challenges arising from efforts to understand biology fascinated and motivated him to continuing research in this highly interdisciplinary area. Later he joined a collaborative project of Prof Pradip Sinha and Prof K Deb (at IIT Kanpur) to understand neoplastic cancer in the model organism D. Melanagastor. He did his PhD from Nanyang Technological University on \"Computational Inteliigence Methods for Problems in Computational Biology\". In particular he worked on multi-class classification, template clustering for short time series data and imbalanced binary classification problems. And prior to joining IIT G, he was part of European Consortium, BaSySBio at Systems Biology Lab (Group Leader: Dr Benno Schwikowski) Institut Pasteur, Paris. His post-doc work was mainly concentrated on regulatory network reconstruction and pathway analysis.",
