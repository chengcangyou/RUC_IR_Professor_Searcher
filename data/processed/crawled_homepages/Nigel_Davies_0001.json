Accept optional cookies Reject optional cookies Cookie settings Professor Nigel Davies Head of Department, Distinguished Professor Research Overview My research focuses on ensuring user privacy in future pervasive environments. Recent research is focused on: the use of privacy mediators to provide users with simple mental models or privacy boundaries (joint work with CMU); privacy aware personalisation and analytics for smart environments; developing new models of user consent based on delegation (joint work with Edinburgh) and more speculative work on understanding the future security and privacy risks in future augmented memory systems (joint work with USI, Switzerland). I also lead Lancaster’s involvement in exploring the use of Blockchain technologies in novel application domains including supporting new forms of charitable giving and providing patients with control over the use of their health data. We have a long history of research in privacy for pervasive computing dating back to the highly cited (427 cites) paper “Preserving privacy in environments with location-based applications”, G Myles, A Friday, N Davies - IEEE Pervasive Computing, 2003.
