Her research group on Safety-critical engineering focuses on bridging the gap between the theoretical foundations of dependability and industrial software development practices of complex dependable systems. Additionally, Prof. Lundqvist is the Director of the RELIANT industrial research school, Chariman of the MDU recruitment committee (engineering), and member of the MDU engineering committee (teknikutskottet). She received a Ph.D. in Computer Systems from Uppsala University in 2000. Prior to coming to Mälardalen University in 2007, she served on the faculty of the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).Professor Lundqvist's research group on Safety-critical engineering focuses on bridging the theoretical foundations of dependability and industrial software development practices, with an emphasis on the technology and process aspects of complex dependable systems.
