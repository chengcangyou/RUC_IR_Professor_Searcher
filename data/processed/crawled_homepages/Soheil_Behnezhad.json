Much of my work focuses on the theoretical foundations of big data algorithms. This includes sublinear time algorithms, parallel algorithms, streaming algorithms, dynamic algorithms, and graph sparsification. Before joining Northeastern, I was a Motwani postdoc at Stanford. I got my PhD from UMD and my BSc from Sharif University. My research is supported by an NSF CAREER Award and a Google Research Award.

Vizing's theorem from 1964 states that any graph of maximum degree â admits a â+1 edge coloring. We present the first near-linear time algorithm that finds such a coloring. 46 Stochastic Matching via In-n-Out Local Computation Algorithms ( STOC '25 ) Amir Azarmehr, Soheil Behnezhad, Alma Ghafari, Ronitt Rubinfeld Summary, arXiv, blog post on property testing review We prove that a polynomial degree (in inverse of realization probability) subgraph can obtain a (1-epsilon)-approximation for stochastic mtaching, improving over the previous quasi-polynomial degree bound of [B., Derakhshan, Hajiaghayi STOC'20]. 45 Settling the Pass Complexity of Approximate Matchings in Dynamic Graph Streams ( SODA '25 ) Sepehr Assadi, Soheil Behnezhad, Christian Konrad, Kheeran Naidu, Janani Sundaresan Summary, arXiv Invited to TALG, special issue for SODA. We settle the complexity of approximate maximum matching in dynamic streams. Our upper bound improves prior logarithmic rounds exponentially to O(log log n), and the lower bound matches this. 44 Massively Parallel Minimum Spanning Tree in General Metric Spaces ( SODA '25 ) Amir Azarmehr, Soheil Behnezhad, Rajesh Jayaram, Jakub ÅÄ cki, Vahab Mirrokni, and Peilin Zhong Summary, arXiv This paper presents improved upper and lower bounds for finding the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a general metric space. 43 Fully Dynamic (â + 1) Coloring Against Adaptive Adversaries ( SODA '25 ) Soheil Behnezhad, Rajmohan Rajaraman, and Omer Wasim Summary, arXiv We present improved bounds for (â + 1) vertex coloring fully dynamic graphs against adaptive adversaries. 42 Correlation Clustering Beyond the Pivot Algorithm ( ICML '25 ) Soheil Behnezhad, Vincent Cohen-Addad Moses Charikar, Alma Ghafari, and Weiyun Ma Summary, arXiv We show that a simple post-processing of the pivot algorithm breaks the longstanding 3-approximation barrier for correlation clustering. 41 Fully Dynamic Matching and Ordered Ruzsa-SzemerÃ©di Graphs ( FOCS '24 ) Soheil Behnezhad and Alma Ghafari Summary, arXiv Invited to Highlights of Algorithms (HALG) 2025. We relate the complexity of maintaining an approximate maximum matching in a dynamic graph to an extremal combinatorics object that we call Oredered Ruzsa-Szemeredi (ORS) graphs. See also the beautiful follow-up works of [Assadi, Khanna, Kiss '25] and [Pratt '25]. 40 Bipartite Matching in Massive Graphs: A Tight Analysis of EDCS ( ICML '24 ) Amir Azarmehr, Soheil Behnezhad, and Mohammad Roghani Summary, arXiv We present a tight analysis of EDCS, which is a versatile matching sparsifier, in bipartite graphs. We show that, surprisingly, the EDCS obtains a strictly better than 2/3-approximation with certain parameters. 39 Streaming Edge Coloring with Asymptotically Optimal Colors ( ICALP '24 ) Soheil Behnezhad and Mohammad Saneian Summary, arXiv We present the first streaming algorithm that finds an O(â) edge-coloring using subquadratic space. 38 Sublinear Algorithms for TSP via Path Covers ( ICALP '24 ) Soheil Behnezhad, Mohammad Roghani, Aviad Rubinstein, and Amin Saberi Summary, arXiv We present improved sublinear time algorithms for estimating the cost of TSP in graphic and (1,2) metrics. 37 Approximating Maximum Matching Requires Almost Quadratic Time ( STOC '24 ) Soheil Behnezhad, Mohammad Roghani, and Aviad Rubinstein Summary arXiv We prove that near-quadratic in n time is needed to approximate the size of maximum matching within an additive error of Îµn. 36 Fully Dynamic Matching: (2-â2)-Approximation in Polylog Update Time ( SODA '24 ) Amir Azarmehr, Soheil Behnezhad, and Mohammad Roghani Summary, arXiv We present a (2-â2)-approximate algorithm for maximum matching in general graphs which has implications in dynamic and streaming settings. Our algorithm removes a large gap that previously existed between general and bipartite graphs. 35 Local Computation Algorithms for Maximum Matching: New Lower Bounds ( FOCS '23 ) Soheil Behnezhad, Mohammad Roghani, and Aviad Rubinstein Summary, arXiv We prove that any local computation algorithm (LCA) for computing a (1-Îµ) approximate maximum matching in graphs of maximum degree â needs to spend at least âÎ©(1/Îµ) time per query. This resolves a decade old open problem of the area. 34 Robust Communication Complexity of Matching: EDCS Achieves 5/6 Approximation ( ICALP '23 ) Amir Azarmehr and Soheil Behnezhad Summary, arXiv We study the \"robust communication complexity\" of the maximum matching problem. The edges of an adversarially chosen n-vertex graph G are partitioned randomly between Alice and Bob. Alice has to send a single message to Bob, using which Bob has to output an approximate maximum matching of G. We present a new (tight) analysis of a known protocol by Bernstein, proving that it obtains a 5/6 approximation with O(n) communication, significantly improving prior approximations. 33 Sublinear Time Algorithms and Complexity of Approximate Maximum Matching ( STOC '23 ) Soheil Behnezhad, Mohammad Roghani, and Aviad Rubinstein Summary, arXiv, blog post on property testing review In this paper, we present the first super linear in n lower bound for approximating maximum matching size. We also present improved upper bounds. 32 On Regularity Lemma and Barriers in Streaming and Dynamic Matching ( STOC '23 ) Sepehr Assadi, Soheil Behnezhad, Sanjeev Khanna, and Huan Li Summary, arXiv This paper shows that Szemeredi's celebrated regularity lemma can be used to obtain non-trivial albeit slight improvements over longstanding barriers for matchings in streaming and dynamic graphs. 31 Dynamic Algorithms for Maximum Matching Size ( SODA '23 ) Soheil Behnezhad Summary, arXiv Best Paper Award at SODA'23. Invited to TALG, special issue for SODA'23. Invited to Highlights of Algorithms (HALG) 2024. This paper improves two longstanding approximation/update-time trade-offs for maximum matching in fully dynamic graphs when the goal is to maintain just the size of the matching. 30 Beating Greedy Matching in Sublinear Time ( SODA '23 ) Soheil Behnezhad, Mohammad Roghani, Aviad Rubinstein, and Amin Saberi Summary, arXiv, blog post on property testing review We give an algorithm that (1/2+Î©(1))-approximates the size of a maximum matching in O(n1+Îµ) time. No subquadratic time algorithm for beating 1/2-approximation was known prior to our work. 29 Single-Pass Streaming Algorithms for Correlation Clustering ( SODA '23 ) Soheil Behnezhad, Moses Charikar, Weiyun Ma, and Li-Yang Tan Summary This paper presents improved algorithms for min-disagreement correlation clustering in a single pass of the streaming setting. 28 Almost 3-Approximate Correlation Clustering in Constant Rounds ( FOCS '22 ) Soheil Behnezhad, Moses Charikar, Weiyun Ma, and Li-Yang Tan Summary, arXiv We show that a (3+Îµ)-approximation of correlation clustering can be found in O(1/Îµ) rounds. This is a culminating point for the rich literature on parallel correlation clustering as the approximation matches a natural bound and the round complexity is essentially constant. 27 New Trade-Offs for Fully Dynamic Matching via Hierarchical EDCS ( SODA '22 ) Soheil Behnezhad and Sanjeev Khanna Summary, arXiv We study the maximum matching problem in fully dynamic graphs where a graph is undergoing both edge insertions and deletions, and the goal is to efficiently maintain a large matching after each edge update. This problem has received considerable attention in recent years. The known algorithms naturally exhibit a trade-off between the quality of the matching maintained (i.e., the approximation ratio) and the time needed per update. While several interesting results have been obtained, the optimal behavior of this trade-off remains largely unclear. Our main contribution is a new approach to designing fully dynamic approximate matching algorithms that",
