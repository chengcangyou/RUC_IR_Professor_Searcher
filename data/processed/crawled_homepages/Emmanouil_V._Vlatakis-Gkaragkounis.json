My research interests focus on Beyond Worst-Case Analysis of Algorithms, Theoretical Foundations of Machine Learning, Algorithmic Game Theory, Optimization, and Dynamical Systems. I received my doctorate degree in Computer Science from Columbia University, under the supervision of Prof. Mihalis Yannakakis and Prof. Rocco Servedio. Before joining UW-Madison, I was a Simons-FODSI Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, working with Prof. Michael Jordan. My research has been recognized at various top-tier conferences, and I have a passion for exploring the intricacies of theoretical computer science.
