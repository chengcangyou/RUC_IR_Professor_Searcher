I am अच्युत मणि त्रिपाठी (Achyut Mani Tripathi) , originally from Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh, India. I am an Assistant Professor (सहायक प्राध्यापक) in the Computer Science & Engineering Department ( संगणक विज्ञान एवं अभियांत्रिकी विभाग) at the Indian Institute of Technology Dharwad (IIT-Dh) (भारतीय प्रौद्योगिकी संस्थान धारवाड़) in Karnataka, India. Academics: Ph.D. Department of Computer Science & Engineering, IIT Guwahati, Assam, India. Office A1-129, Academic Block-1, IIT Dharwad Email t.achyut@iitdh.ac.in Landline Landline: 1084 (Inside), 08362309730 (Outside) Research Interests Designing Deep Architectures Image,Video and Audio Classification Deep Model Compression Knowledge Distillation, Dataset Distillation Adversarial Machine Learning Adversarial Attacks, Backdoor Attacks Multi-Modal Learning AVSC, AVSE, AVEL, AVQA, AQA, VQA Machine Unlearning Class and Instance Specific Machine Unlearning Time Series Classification, Forecasting New Highlights and Announcements ( Paper Accepted: IEEE TAI 2025)→ MalaNet: A Small World Inspired Neural Network for Automated Malaria Diagnosis (Congratulations to All Co-Authors) I am seeking highly motivated B.Tech students with exceptional coding skills and a strong mathematical foundation to join my research group. If you have a CGPA of 9.0 or higher and are eager to contribute to BTP/R&D projects in this area, please send me your detailed CV. Just so you know, BTP will not be offered until a student has completed R&D work under my supervision. BTP will be considered if the student’s performance in R&D meets expectations. I am particularly interested in students who are committed to pursuing higher studies and are willing to invest significant time in publishing research articles in top venues. Irrespective of the academic program (B.Tech, M.Tech, M.S., or Ph.D.), any student interested in joining the group must first complete a programming assignment test. Based on his or her performance in the test, a position in the group may be offered. If the results are not satisfactory, the student is advised to seek guidance from another faculty member for their R&D, BTP, MTP, M.S., or Ph.D. work. Additionally, one should only contact me for BTP/R&D if they are confident in their coding skills; let's save and respect each other's time. I am not interested in offering any Short-Term Internships, MTP, Ph.D., Online Internships, or Mini-Projects for the next few years. Please do not request a Letter of Recommendation (LOR) solely based on attending my courses. An LOR will only be provided if you have participated in R&D or BTP under my supervision and demonstrated exceptional performance in the project.
