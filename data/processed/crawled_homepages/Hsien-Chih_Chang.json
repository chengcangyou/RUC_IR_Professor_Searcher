I usually find simple objects (like polygons, curves, planar graphs, surfaces and meshes) cute and attracting. Well, actually, anything with the word \"algorithm\" or \"topology\" catches my attention. Research Projects Papers Amazing junior researchers supevised by me. Go check out their work. Jonathan Conroy: PhD researcher. Metric embedding and sketching. Reilly Browne: PhD researcher. Optimization on geometric objects. Teaching Spring 2025: COSC 39 Theory of Computation I love chickens. Look at all those chickens. Chicken chicken chickens. Repeat after me: Gallus gallus domesticus. last modified on",
