Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate working with Prof. Deepak Ganesan in the College of Information & Computer Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill, advised by Prof. Shahriar Nirjon. Prior to my Ph.D., I received B.E. in Computer Engineering from Stony Brook University. My research interest falls under the broad umbrella of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), and is driven by the goal of enhancing the sensing and computation capability of low-power, low-cost, and low-maintenance ubiquitous systems that have applications in health, public safety, automation, and beyond. In contrast to developing algorithms based on existing datasets, I look at systems in a pragmatic way, i.e., I build real systems to collect real-world data, examine their characteristics, and push the boundaries of their sensing and computation capabilities. I have fully-funded RA positions available and looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students. Send me an email along with your CV!
