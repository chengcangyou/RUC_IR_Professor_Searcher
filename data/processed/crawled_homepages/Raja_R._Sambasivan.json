I mentor an incredible group of students at the D.O.C.C. Lab. We generally focus on systems. Recently, we have been especially interested in observability techniques for cloud-based distributed systems. From November of 2016 to July of 2019, I was a Red Hat Visiting Research Scientist at Boston University. I worked on the Mass Open Cloud project with Orran Krieger, focusing on architectures for building vendor-neutral clouds and creating problem diagnosis tools for them. From May of 2013 to October of 2016, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). I worked on the XIA project with Peter Steenkiste, focusing on evolvability for inter-domain routing protocols. Our SIGCOMM paper showed that two simple mechanisms implemented within existing routing protocols would allow them to facilitate incremental deployment of future inter-domain routing protocols. These features would provide incentives for both early adopters of new protocols as well as avoid disincentives for parties uninterested in them. I completed my Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon in May 2013 and was advised by Greg Ganger. My dissertation, “Diagnosing performance changes in distributed systems by comparing request flows”, focused on creating methods to diagnose performance problems in the distributed systems society relies on for their everyday tasks. Today, these methods are commonly used in industry under the moniker “distributed tracing.” The resulting papers (HotAC, NSDI, InfoVis, SoCC) influenced these industrial efforts. In my spare time, I enjoy playing tennis, taking long walks, and exploring New England. I am “famous” for appearing in a PhDComics strip. In the strip, I ask CS PhD students to wear lab coats to work so that folks will know that we are researchers too . Don’t forget to pop on a pair of lab goggles when debugging! research opportunities Prospective PhDs: I recruit one to two PhD students per year to work on projects broadly related to systems and networking. I look for students who are curious, have strong technical skills, communicate well, and like exploring (slightly) crazy ideas. If you are interested, please apply to Tufts CS and send me an email. The application deadline is usually September 15th for Spring admission and December 15th for Fall admission. Tufts undergrads & Master’s students: My lab hosts a few undergrads & Master’s students every year. If you are interested, send me an email. It helps if you have already taken or are planning to take Cloud Computing (CS 118), Networking (CS 112), or Operating Systems (CS 111). scheduling meetings Separately from class office hours, I am available for 15-minute meetings with Tufts undergrads and Master’s students between 5 pm and 6 pm on Fridays. You may book meeting slot up to two weeks in advance. Please use this link to schedule a meeting. news Sep 25, 2025 I guess we’re branching out to databases! Check out my student Tony Astolfi’s latest arXiv paper titled “Dynamic read & write optimization with TurtleKV”. Its about a key/value store can be dynamically tuned to support fast reads or writes. Dec 23, 2024 I’m serving on the NSDI’26 Program Committee Mar 03, 2024 Received a NSF CAREER Award! Thank you to the NSF for this gracious award and to my students for making this award possible with their hard work.

Sambasivan In ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering , May 2024 Abs Bib PDF Slides Alibaba’s 2021 and 2022 microservice datasets are the only publicly available sources of request-workflow traces from a large-scale microservice deployment. They have the potential to strongly influence future research as they provide much-needed visibility into industrial microservices’ characteristics. We conduct the first systematic analyses of both datasets to help facilitate their use by the community. We find that the 2021 dataset contains numerous inconsistencies preventing accurate reconstruction of full trace topologies. The 2022 dataset also suffers from inconsistencies, but at a much lower rate. Tools that strictly follow Alibaba’s specs for constructing traces from these datasets will silently ignore these inconsistencies, misinforming researchers by creating traces of the wrong sizes and shapes. Tools that discard traces with inconsistencies will discard many traces. We present Casper, a construction method that uses redundancies in the datasets to sidestep the inconsistencies. Compared to an approach that discards traces with inconsistencies, Casper accurately reconstructs an additional 25.5% of traces in the 2021 dataset (going from 58.32% to 83.82%) and an additional 12.18% in the 2022 dataset (going from 86.42% to 98.6%). @inproceedings{Huye2024, author = {Huye, Darby and Liu, Lan and Sambasivan, Raja R.}, title = {Systemizing and mitigating topological inconsistencies in Alibaba's microservice call-graph datasets}, booktitle = {ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering}, publisher = {ACM/SPEC}, month = may, year = {2024}, doi = {https://www.doi.org/10.1145/3629526.3645043}, isbn = {979-8-4007-0444-4/24/05}, } ATC Lifting the veil on Meta’s microservice architecture: Analyses of topology and request workflows Darby Huye , Yuri Shkuro , and Raja R. Sambasivan In USENIX Annual Technical Conference , Jul 2023 Abs Bib PDF Slides The microservice architecture is a novel paradigm for building and operating distributed applications in many organizations. This paradigm changes many aspects of how distributed applications are built, managed, and operated in contrast to monolithic applications. It introduces new challenges to solve and requires changing assumptions about previously well-known ones. But, today, the characteristics of large-scale microservice architectures are invisible outside their organizations, depressing opportunities for research. Recent studies provide only partial glimpses and represent only single design points. This paper enriches our understanding of large-scale microservices by characterizing Meta’s microservice architecture. It focuses on previously unreported (or underreported) aspects important to developing and researching tools that use the microservice topology or traces of request workflows. We find that the topology is extremely heterogeneous, is in constant flux, and includes software entities that do not cleanly fit in the microservice architecture. Request work- flows are highly dynamic, but local properties can be predicted using service and endpoint names. We quantify the impact of obfuscating factors in microservice measurement and conclude with implications for tools and future-work opportunities. @inproceedings{Huye2023, author = {Huye, Darby and Shkuro, Yuri and Sambasivan, Raja R.}, title = {Lifting the veil on {M}eta's microservice architecture: {A}nalyses of topology and request workflows}, booktitle = {USENIX Annual Technical Conference}, publisher = {USENIX}, pages = {419-432}, year = {2023}, month = jul, day = {10}, isbn = {978-1-939133-35-9}, } SoCC Automating instrumentation choices for performance problems in distributed applications with VAIF Mert Toslali , Emre Ates , Alex Ellis , and 6 more authors In ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing , Nov 2021 Abs Bib PDF Slides Developers use logs to diagnose performance problems in distributed applications. However, it is difficult to know a priori where logs are needed and what information in them is needed to help diagnose problems that may occur in the future. We present the Variance-driven Automated Instrumentation Framework (VAIF), which runs alongside distributed applica- tions. In response to newly-observed performance problems, VAIF automatically searches the space of possible instrumen- tation choices to enable the logs needed to help diagnose them. To work, VAIF combines distributed tracing (an enhanced form of logging) with insights about how response-time variance can be decomposed on the critical-path portions of requests’ traces. We evaluate VAIF by using it to localize performance problems in OpenStack and HDFS. We show that VAIF can localize problems related to slow code paths, resource contention, and problematic third-party code while enabling only 3-34% of the total tracing instrumentation. @inproceedings{Toslali2021, author = {Toslali, Mert and Ates, Emre and Ellis, Alex and Zhang, Zhaoqi and Huye, Darby and Liu, Lan and Puterman, Samantha and Coskun, Ayse K. and Sambasivan, Raja R.}, title = {Automating instrumentation choices for performance problems in distributed applications with VAIF}, booktitle = {ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing}, publisher = {ACM}, pages = {}, year = {2021}, month = nov, keywords = {} } SIGCOMM Bootstrapping evolvability for inter-domain routing with D-BGP Raja R. Sambasivan , David Tran-Lam , Aditya Akella , and 1 more author In ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication (SIGCOMM) , Aug 2017 Abs Bib PDF Video Slides Video Abstract The Internet’s inter-domain routing infrastructure, provided today by BGP, is extremely rigid and does not facilitate the introduction of new inter-domain routing protocols. This rigidity has made it incredibly difficult to widely deploy critical fixes to BGP. It has also depressed ASes’; ability to sell value-added services or replace BGP entirely with a more sophisticated protocol. Even if operators undertook the significant effort needed to fix or replace BGP, it is likely the next protocol will be j",
