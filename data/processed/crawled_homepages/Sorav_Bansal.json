Running a research-based startup called CompilerAI CompilerAI is a team of PhDs in formal methods and/or compilers. We are looking to recruit people with prior research experience in these areas. Brief Bio Sorav Bansal is a professor at the CS department at IIT Delhi, and works on program superoptimization. He is currently on a long leave from IIT Delhi, and is working on superoptimization in the context of quantitative trading at Graviton Research Capital. Sorav obtained his B.Tech. from IIT Delhi, and Ph.D. from Stanford University. Summary Publications at ASPLOS (3), OOPSLA (2), PLDI, SOSP, OSDI, CGO, SAT, and APLAS. Most publications are on translation validation and superoptimization. IITD Teaching Excellence Award. Over 800K Youtube views for lecture videos. Contributed two chapters to the Indian edition of the Dragon book. Faculty Awards from Qualcomm (2022) and IBM (2013). Grants from VMWare, NetApp, Freescale, Huawei, Microsoft, and IBM.

Towards this, we have developed a black-box equivalence checker, and these papers describe some of the problems we solved in the process, and our current results. More details on the early part of this work are also available in Manjeet Dahiya's PhD thesis. If you are interested in exploring further, please check our project page. This talk video (slides) summarizes the high-level motivation and results so far. [ ASPLOS 2019 ] HawkEye: Efficient Fine-grained OS Support for Huge Pages [ slides, lightning talk ] This paper discusses simple yet effective algorithms for huge-page management in the OS kernel. The primary ideas are: access-coverage based huge-page promotion, asynchronous page pre-zeroing, exploring the notion of fairness in dealing with huge-page allocations, and the effect of using hardware performance counters to estimate the benefits of huge-page allocations. The ideas are evaluated over a wide range of workloads for several metrics. [ TPDS 2017 ] The Unicorn Runtime: Efficient distributed shared memory programming for hybrid CPU-GPU clusters How can a programmer harness the combined computing power of CPUs and GPUs in a computing cluster without dealing with all the nitty gritties of the underlying system and its optimizations? The paper presents an intuitive programming model (which is perhaps not entirely new). The contribution of the paper is in algorithms to automatically map a program written in this programming model on a cluster of CPUs and GPUs through compile-time and run-time support in a system called Unicorn. [ ASPLOS 2013 ] Efficient Virtualization on Embedded Power Architecture Platforms I quote one of our ASPLOS 2013 reviewers: ---begin quote--- I find it extremely interesting to observe how a small set of seemingly innocuous architectural differences between Power and x86 leads to completely different \"locally optimal\" BT virtualization approaches (comparing this approach with the one outlined in the Adams paper [4]). These differences are: x86 has segmentation, Power has software-loaded TLB and variable page sizes, Power has orthogonal rwx page permissions, and x86 has variable length instructions. It is almost like asking, how would the universe differ if the fine structure constant had a value of 0.00829 instead of 0.00729. Answer: a lot! For this reason, I think the paper is a very good fit for ASPLOS. Even if architects do their best to think carefully about ramifications of their choices, this paper is an eye opener into a world of, probably, unforeseen consequences. As such, like it very much. And I think it should be a must-read for current and future architects (and not just narrowly from a virtualization point of view). ---end quote--- Thank you dear (anonymous) reviewer for liking our work!
