Hawkins professor of computer science at Brown University, during  2002-2007 I was also the department chair. Before coming to Brown in 1998 I was a researcher and project manager at the IBM Almaden Research Center in California, and a professor at the Weizmann Institute in Israel. I received an undergraduate degree in mathematics and statistics and a doctorate degree in computer science from the Hebrew University  in Jerusalem, Israel. My research focuses on the design and analysis of algorithms. In particular I'm interested in randomized algorithms and probabilistic analysis of algorithms. Applications range from combinatorial and stochastic optimization to routing and communication networks, computational biology, and computational finance.
