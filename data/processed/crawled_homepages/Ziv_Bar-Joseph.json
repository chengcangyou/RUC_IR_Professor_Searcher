I am the recipient of the 2012 Overton Prize in computational biology. My primary research areas are computational Biology, Bioinformatics and Machine learning. I am heading the Systems Biology Group at the School of Computer Science at CMU. Our group develops computational methods for understanding the interactions, dynamics and conservation of complex biological systems. Our work addresses issues ranging from the experimental design level to the systems biology level. I am also interested in how shared principles between computation and biology can be used to improve our understanding of both fields. We are looking at algorithms used by nature to see if we can obtain new ideas on how to design better algrotihms for distributed computing systems while at the same time infer new insights regarding information processing in biology. I like to spend some of my spare time running. In the past I have enjoyed the Cambridge Running Club. I am also enjoying the many trails that Pittsburgh offers for long distance running. 2019-2020: We are looking for postdocs to join our group. See the Open Positions page for details.
