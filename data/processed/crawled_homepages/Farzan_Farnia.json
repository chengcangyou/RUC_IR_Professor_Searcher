Hong Kong Email: farnia AT cse.cuhk.edu.hk [Google Scholar] [LinkedIn] About Me I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Prior to joining CUHK, I was a postdoctoral research associate at the Laboratory for Information & Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, from 2019-2021. I received my M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University where I was a graduate research assistant at the Information Systems Laboratory advised by David Tse. I also received my B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics from Sharif University of Technology. My research interests lie in learning and information sciences with a particular focus on multi-learner learning frameworks where I study the convergence, equilibrium, and robustness properties of multi-learner learning algorithms.
