I'm an assistant professor in the Computer Science Department and the Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences (ICES) at the University of Texas at Austin.I was a PhD student at the Columbia Computer Graphics Group and a postdoc at Harvard SEAS.Office: GDC 5.508Email: evouga@cs.utexas.edu Research: I am particularly interested inphysical simulation, particularly of thin, elastic materials like cloth, hair, and paper, as they deform and collide;geometry processing and design, using advances in our mathematical understanding of discrete geometry to better manipulate and design using coarse, discrete data; and applying ideas from these areas to solving problems in computer graphics, computational mechanics, and scientific computing.Industry applications of my research include special effects simulations in The Hobbit and Tangled, and Artec's Shapify 3D portrait service. Teaching: I teach honors Computer Graphics, and a Physical Simulation graduate elective, every spring. See the course page for more details.Prospective Students: I am not actively looking to expand my research group significantly at this time; however, I'm open to hiring additional talented graduate students whose research interests are a particularly good fit. Please e-mail me if you are interested.",
