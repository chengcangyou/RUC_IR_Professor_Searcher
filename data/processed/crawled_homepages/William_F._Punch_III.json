I greatly enjoyed my time working and teaching at MSU but time marches on and I have moved on to a new phase of life. As such I am no longer taking graduate students for research, though I am hoping to keep my hand in teaching as I enjoy it so. I will still check my email at punch@cse.msu.edu though probably less often than in the past. Thanks to all the great colleagues and amazing students I have worked with all these many years.",
