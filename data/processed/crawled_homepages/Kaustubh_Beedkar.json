My research interests are in data management and data systems, with a focus on compliant data processing that enables efficient data access and data sharing under privacy, security, and regulatory requirements. I also work on data federations for integrating and querying heterogeneous, distributed data sources, and on scalable data analytics to support advanced analysis over large and evolving datasets Prior to joining IIT Delhi, I spent close to six years at the Technische UniversitÃ¤t (TU) Berlin, where I worked as a Senior Researcher with Prof. Volker Markl in the Database Systems and Information Management (DIMA) Group and at the Berlin Institute for the Foundations of Learning and Data(BIFOLD). I did my PhD studies in Computer Science at the the Databases and Information Systems group at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics in SaarbrÃ¼cken, and at the University of Mannheim, Germany under the supervision of Prof. Rainer Gemulla.
