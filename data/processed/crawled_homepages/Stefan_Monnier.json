I see a future where all programming is done in type safe languages or in assembly supplemented with safety proofs. I am also interested in investigating what such a future means in terms of how we distribute the work between compilers, runtime systems, operating systems and computer architecture. My main focus of research until now has for this reason been at the intersection between type-safety and memory-management which, from a programming-language point of view, is the most important part of the runtime system and the operating system. Hacking Emacs I was maintainer of Emacs for quite a few years, so most of my contributions are included in there. Typer The bastard child of ML+Scheme+Coq: A programming language of the ML family, but inspired by Scheme's minimalism and syntactic structure and built on top of a pure Î»-calculus with dependent types, similar to Coq's. BuGit A distributed Issue Tracking System that builds on Git and aims to really let Issues live their own decentralized lives.

Together with fellow researchers, I instigated the QuÃ©bec Programming Languages Seminaire. Collaboration with the Logic and Computation group at McGill. Inference of class relationships in Java for UML-like models, together with Yann-GaÃ«l GuÃ©hÃ©neuc. Typing the implementation of various object oriented mechanisms, together with Chris League.

Previous occupation While doing my PhD research at Yale, I spent time organizing for GESO and hacking on Emacs (including a few elisp packages, all of which are now bundled with Emacs, except for sml-mode). My background is supposedly outlined in the Curriculum Vitae I used when looking for a job, but you might also want to check my home village's web page (as I said, it's a village, so don't expect too much). The site used to have nice pictures where (if you knew the place), you could recognize some buildings like the ones of the banks which manage the spare change of the world's tyrants (makes me wonder: does W have a swiss bank account?).",
