AboutBiographyResearcher working on problems within areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) at the Institute for People-Centred AI (PAI) and School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering. As a research lead, I manage Human-Machine Interaction theme @ PAI, and the NLP subgroup within the Nature Inspired Computing and Engineering group (NICE) @ Computer Science Research Centre. I also lead the teaching on the NLP module offered to undergraduate (COM3029) and postgraduate students (COMM061). My research focuses on developing scalable and safe human-machine interaction using foundation models. Guided by the principles of Responsible and Inclusive AI, my work emphasises cross-lingual and multimodal learning to address challenges like online toxicity, misinformation, and digital accessibility for low-resource languages. All our research outcomes- code, data, and models, are publicly available on the SurreyNLP GitHub and HuggingFace.My prior roles include a Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Centre for Translation Studies, a joint PhD from IIT Bombay and Monash University, and Research Engineer at the CFILT Lab.

Whilst the primary aim of the project was to create a dataset for a low-resource language pair, we plan to use this dataset to investigate different zero-shot, few-shot prompting strategies, including chain-of-thought, and leveraging reinforcement learning towards a unified explainable QE-APE framework.PI: Archchana SindhujanCo-I: Prof Constantin OrăsanRelated publicationsPrompt-based Explainable Quality Estimation for English-Malayalam--- Expand research projects SupervisionPostgraduate research supervisionPostdocHadeel Saadany [2023-2024; Lightweight Contextual Embeddings for Product Search (w/ eBay Inc., USA)]GraduatedShenbin Qian (CTS, FABS; Supervisor: Prof Constantin Orăsan, Dr Félix do Carmo)Primary Supervision (ongoing)Archchana Sindhujan (PAI, FEPS; Co-supervisor: Prof Constantin Orăsan)Fatemeh Nazarieh (NICE, FEPS; Co-supervisor: Dr Muhammad Rana, Dr Zhenhua Feng)Girish Koushik (NICE, FEPS; Co-supervisor: Prof Helen Treharne)Xinran Liu (NICE, FEPS; Co-supervisor: Prof Wenwu Wang, Dr Zhenhua Feng)Co-supervision (ongoing)Swapnil Bhosale (PAI, FEPS; Supervisor: Dr Xiatian Zhu)Aisha Saeid (NICE, FEPS; Supervisor: Prof Ferrante Neri)Olutope Adebiyi (LLL, FABS; Supervisor: Dr Doris Dippold)Jordan Painter (CTS, FABS; Supervisor: Prof Sabine Braun) Expand TeachingI lead the teaching on Natural Language Processing (NLP) module which is an optional for final year undergraduate students on the BSc Computer Science programme (COM3029; FHEQ Level 6), and MSc Data Science and MSc Artificial Intelligence programmes (COMM061; FHEQ Level 7).Within additional learning hours, every semester I introduce an aspect of skill development or learning in AI along with the module. In 2023/24, student were encouraged to read papers on multimodal information processing in AI, try out different coding implementations, helping them complete the coursework using innovative approaches.

In this study, we investigate segment-level QE methods comparing encoder-based models such as MonoTransQuest, CometKiwi, and xCOMET with various decoder-based methods (Tower+, ALOPE, and other instruction-fine-tuned language models). Our work primarily focused on utilizing eight low-resource language pairs, involving both English on the source side and the target side of the translation. Results indicate that while fine-tuned encoder-based models remain strong performers across most low-resource language pairs, decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) show clear improvements when adapted through instruction tuning. Importantly, the ALOPE framework further enhances LLM performance beyond standard fine-tuning, demonstrating its effectiveness in narrowing the gap with encoder-based approaches and highlighting its potential as a viable strategy for low-resource QE. In addition, our experiments demonstrates that with adaptation techniques such as LoRA (Low Rank Adapters) and quantization, decoder-based QE models can be trained with competitive GPU memory efficiency, though they generally require substantially more disk space than encoder-based models. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of encoder-based models for low-resource QE and suggest that advances in cross-lingual modeling will be key to improving LLM-based QE in the future.Girish A.
