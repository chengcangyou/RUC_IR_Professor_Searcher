Winter 2026: COMP 409 Concurrent Programming. Research Interests I am interested in several research areas. If you are student with some interest in one or other of these topics, check out the \"Prospective\" tab and contact me. Modern computer gamesI am interested in various topics related to formalizing and understanding different aspects of games. Much of the recent work has focused on level analysis and design concerns, especially in the context of practical and effective game AI, but also on approaches to procedural content generation, and game narrative as well. You can find publications on the publication tab, student theses on the students tab, and more general information on the sometimes-working GR@M website. Compilers and LanguagesMuch of my research work has focused on compiler analysis and optimization, especially in the context of concurrent computing. I have a current interest in optimization of web-based computation (such as via WebAssembly), exploiting concurrency in general, as well as a more theoretical interest in memory consistency, especially as a pertains to compiler optimization.You can find publications on the publication tab, student theses on the students tab, and more general information on the aging Sable Research Group website. Publications I mainly target conferences, rather than journals. I do not have convenient links to all publications, particularly the older ones. If you are interested in an article, feel free to email me. Also note that other than a few older ones I have not included technical reports in this list.
