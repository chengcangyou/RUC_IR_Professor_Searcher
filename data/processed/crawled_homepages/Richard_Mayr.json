PhD in Computer Science at TU-Munich, Germany, 1998 and Habilitation at University of Freiburg, Germany, 2002. Since then I have worked in many different countries. Short CV My Erdös number is 3. Find your number at MathSciNet . Open positions PhD Studentships I am looking for PhD students with a strong background in mathematics and/or theoretical computer science. Current research topics include Game Theory, Markov Decision Processes, Efficient Algorithms, Logic and Automata Theory. See our general website for information on how to apply (and funding options, etc.), and contact me if you do. Apart from the standard PhD program for students who already hold an MSc, there are also combined 4-year MSc/PhD programs (EPSRC-funded Doctoral Training Centers; CDTs). Students undertake an initial MSc by Research year, followed by three years of PhD study. See details on CDTs. Research Interests Game theory. Non-algorithmic problems: Strategy complexity in infinite-state stochastic games and Markov decision processes. Algorithmic game theory: Decidability and computational complexity of algorithmic questions about finite games and about finitely described infinite-state games. Formal Verification Formal models for distributed systems: Petri nets, process algebras and automata theoretic models. Verification of systems with infinitely many states. Algorithms for the design and verification of reactive and distributed systems. Decidability and complexity of model checking problems. Decidability and complexity of bisimulation equivalence and other semantic equivalences. Logic Automata Theory Term rewriting. My habilitation thesis: ``On Verification Problems for Systems with Infinite State Spaces''. , (September 2002). My PhD thesis: ``Decidability and Complexity of Model Checking Problems for Infinite-State Systems''. , (April 1998). Publications (see also the listing at the DBLP server ) Publications in refereed journals and conference proceedings Technical reports, theses and other texts. Book chapters Software Tools Some practical tools for solving computationally hard problems in automata theory, in particular language inclusion, equivalence and universality, and minimization of non-deterministic automata.
