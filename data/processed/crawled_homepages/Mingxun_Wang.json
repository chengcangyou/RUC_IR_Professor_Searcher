Our goal is organize and create tools to explore the chemical world around us. We are a computational lab but operate in a highly collaborate way with a world-wide network of wet-lab scientists. These collaborations drive the computational challenges that we tackle to ensure we build tools together and for the community. Checkout the research areas we are involved in, the computational tools we've developed, and the team that make it all possible. We are always on the lookout for talented and motivated students so if that's you please consider joining us!
