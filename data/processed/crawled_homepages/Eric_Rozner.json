My interests lie in computer systems, with an emphasis on datacenter network management, wireless communication, and mobile computing. Previously, I was a Master Inventor and a Research Staff Member in the Austin Research Laboratory (ARL) within IBM Research, and also a Senior Member of the Technical Staff at AT&T Labs - Research. I received my PhD from the University of Texas at Austin and my BS from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My students and I form the CU Boulder Interconnected Systems and Optimized Networks (BISON) Lab. We are part of the Networking and Security Research (NSR) group as well as the Computer Systems group at Colorado. Note: I am curently on leave at Google.
