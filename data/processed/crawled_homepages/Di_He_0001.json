He was previously a senior researcher at the Machine Learning Group, Microsoft Research Asia. He obtained his bachelor, master and Ph.D. degrees from Peking University, advised by Liwei Wang.Di’s main research focuses on generative models (e.g., large language models) and AI4Science. The primary goal of his work is to develop efficient algorithms that can capture accurate and robust features from data through deep neural networks. To achieve this goal, Di focuses on providing a deeper understanding of different neural network architectures for different practical scenarios and their optimization processes. Di won the ICLR 2023 Outstanding Paper Award and ICLR 2024 Outstanding Paper Honorable Mention. He has been serving on the PCs and Senior PCs of the top machine learning and artificial intelligence conferences, such as ICML, NIPS, ICLR.Publications (Full List)Kai Yang, Jan Ackermann, Zhenyu He, Guhao Feng, Bohang Zhang, Yunzhen Feng, Qiwei Ye, Di He, Liwei Wang, “Do Efficient Transformers Really Save Computation?”, ICML 2024Mingqing Xiao, Yixin Zhu, Di He, Zhouchen Lin, “Temporal Spiking Neural Networks with Synaptic Delay for Graph Reasoning”, ICML 2024Tianlang Chen, Shengjie Luo, Di He, Shuxin Zheng, Tie-Yan Liu, Liwei Wang, “GeoMFormer: A General Architecture for Geometric Molecular Representation Learning”, ICML 2024Zhenyu He, Guhao Feng, Shengjie Luo, Kai Yang, Liwei Wang, Jingjing Xu, Zhi Zhang, Hongxia Yang, Di He, “Two Stones Hit One Bird: Bilevel Positional Encoding for Better Length Extrapolation”, ICML 2024Zhenyu He, Zexuan Zhong, Tianle Cai, Jason D.
