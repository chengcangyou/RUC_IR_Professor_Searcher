Curriculum Vitae Google Scholar DBLP Welcome to Jieung Kim's Page I am Jieung Kim, an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science, College of Computing at Yonsei University, South Korea. I am interested in designing secure-guaranteed systems using multiple formal techniques. Before I joined Yonsei University, I was an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Engineering, College of Software and Convergence at Inha University, South Korea. Before that, I was a research (software) engineer - privacy & security at Cerebra (Personal AI), Google Research and Machine Learning Model Optimization Team, Core ML, Google. Even before that, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at FLINT group in Yale with Professor Zhong Shao, and also achieved my Ph.D. degree from the same university (Yale) at 2019. I received my Master's degree at KAIST with the advise from Professor Sukyoung Ryu, and received my Bachelor's degree from Sungkyunkwan University. I am actively looking for students (undergraduate and graduate) who are interested in all techniques and researches (testing, fuzzing, abstract interpretation, static analysis, formal verification) related to software (distributed systems, operating systems, and block chain) and neural network reliability, programming language related researches, system software securities, and machine learning model optimization framework techniques. 소프트웨어 (운영체제, 분산 시스템, 블록체인)및 인공 신경망 신뢰성 관련 모든 방법론 및 연구들 (테스팅, 퍼징, 요약 해석, 정적 분석, 정형 검증), 프로그래밍 언어 관련 연구, 시스템 소프트웨어 보안, 머신러닝 최적화 프레임워크 등에 관심이 있는 학부생 대학원생 분들은 연락 주세요.
