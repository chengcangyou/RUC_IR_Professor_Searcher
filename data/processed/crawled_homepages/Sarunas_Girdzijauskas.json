I lead the Graph Analytics and Network Learning group (GALE) at the SCS division. I got my PhD from Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in 2009. I was appointed as a Docent in Computer Science at KTH in 2016. My research focuses on Information Network Analytics, Decentralized Machine Learning, Data Mining, distributed systems & P2P overlays, and Blockchain technologies. I was the coordinator of H2020 Marie Curie European Training Network \"RAIS\" (2018-2023) as well as the coordinator of Marie Curie ITN \"iSocial\" (2012-2017). I was also Activity Leader of a number of EIT Digital Innovation Activities (in 2014, 2016, and 2017). From 2016 to 2019 I was running the annual EIT Digital Summer School on Big Data Analytics. From 2019 to 2022, I was the Program Director for the doctoral program \"Information and Communication Technology\" at EECS. Currently, I serve as a Deputy Director of Third-Cycle Education (FA) at EECS. I have supervised/examined more than 60 master theses at KTH.
