Research My research interests lie at the intersection of the computer security, privacy, and distributed systems fields. I am particularly interested in the design and analysis of systems that can be used to facilitate secure interactions across multiple security domains while still preserving each individual's privacy and autonomy. My work also investigates individuals' perceptions of privacy in the context of IoT and sensor-based systems, and the design of sensing systems that balance functionality and the privacy needs of users. My research has been supported by the NSF and DARPA, and I am an NSF CAREER award recipient.

If you are interested in applying to our graduate program, you can find more information here. Unfortunately, I am not always able to respond to e-mail from prospective students, and I apologize in advance. If you have already been admitted to our CS graduate program and are interested in pursuing a research project with me, please stop by my office or send me e-mail.
