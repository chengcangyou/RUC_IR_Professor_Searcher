Gül ÇalikliAssociate Professor (Senior Lecturer) in Software Engineering at the School of Computing Follow University of Glasgow Email ResearchGate Twitter LinkedIn Google Scholar ORCIDI am a Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) in Software Engineering at the School of Computing Science, University of Glasgow, UK. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from Boğaziçi University, Istanbul. Before joining the University of Glasgow, I was a senior researcher at the Department of Informatics, University of Zurich (UZH), Switzerland. Further details about my professional appointments can be found in my CV. My research field is empirical software engineering with a focus on human aspects (cognitive and social psychology) accompanied by Data Analytics and Machine Learning. My vision is to enhance software practitioners’ decision-making to improve software quality by developing (1) tools and techniques based on cognitive psychology; and (2) ML systems (e.g., LLMs) with human in the loop that can be regarded as a joint cognitive system.INTERESTED IN DOING A Ph.D.? I am looking for self-motivated students with strong programming skills (e.g., Java, Python, C++, etc.) and background in statistical analysis and Machine Learning (e.g., Deep Learning, NLP, LLMs). Industrial or open-source software development experience is desirable. You can read about the Ph.D. Application Process and Scholarships here. Usual application deadline is 31st January every year. Feel free to contact me with your CV, academic transcript and publications (if any) ideally 1-2 months before the Ph.D. application deadline, if you are interested.NewsSeptember 2025: I've have been invited to serve on the Editorial Board as an Associate Editor for the ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM).
