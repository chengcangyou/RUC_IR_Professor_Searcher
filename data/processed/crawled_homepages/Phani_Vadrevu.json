I work as an Assistant Professor in the Division of Computer Science and Engineering at the Louisiana State University (LSU). I am also a faculty member of the Center for Computation and Technology (CCT) at LSU. Previously, I enjoyed working as a Canizaro-Livingston Endowed Assistant Professor in Cybersecurity at the University of New Orleans. Prior to that, I was lucky to have completed my Ph.D. from University of Georgia under the supervision of an incredible advisor, Dr. Roberto Perdisci!I am intrigued by all areas of applied security. My current research interests lie in web security and privacy with a particular focus on measuring and dismantling social engineering attacks. I am also very interested in tackling web/internet security problems from HCI and social computing perspectives. I often tend to apply machine learning techniques to solve system security problems.",
