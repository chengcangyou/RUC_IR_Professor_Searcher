Hi, I'm an Assistant Professor at Yonsei University in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, where I co-lead the Human-Data Interaction Lab. My research focuses on addressing key challenges in responsible AI, such as model failure, bias, and safety. I take a human-centered approach, often through interactive data visualization, to help practitioners explore data and analyze model behavior. For example, our interactive tools have been extensively used at Google for model evaluation and featured at Google I/O. Before joining Yonsei, I was a Senior Research Scientist at Google DeepMind in the People + AI Research (PAIR) team and an Assistant Professor at Oregon State University. I received my Ph.D. from Georgia Tech, advised by Polo Chau, along with a Dissertation Award. Areas of expertise: Data Visualization, Responsible AI, Human-Computer Interaction Research Interests AI systems are inherently imperfect. They fail unexpectedly, reflect biases, or raise safety concerns. We believe these issues are best addressed by enabling people to actively engage with the data behind these systems. To support this, our research group develops methods and tools that help people make sense of and analyze such data, drawing on methods from data visualization, human-computer interaction, and responsible AI. We're particularly interested in (but not limited to): Evaluation of LLMs: Identifying categories of prompts where models fail, analyzing their behavior, and comparing models. Interactive Data Visualization: Exploring large-scale datasets (e.g., text, images, videos) to uncover insights. Red Teaming and Bias Analysis: Assessing bias, fairness, and safety risks with human-in-the-loop methods. Debugging AI Agents: Visualizing AI systems to explain their unexpected behavior. Note for Prospective Students We're actively looking for graduate students and undergraduate interns. If you're interested, please email me your CV, transcript, and a one-page statement explaining why you'd like to work with us and what relevant experience you have. If there's a potential fit, I'll get back to you within a week regarding next steps.
