Welcome, welcome! You have stumbled upon a web page of an assistant professor in Computer Science and a Canada Research Chair (Tier 2) at the University of Victoria in Victoria, B.C., Canada 🇨🇦. Note: I am currently looking for new PhD and MSc students to join my lab in Fall 2025. All positions will be funded. Go here for more details about UVic. If you are interested in computational biology, compilers, programming languages and algorithm design and do not mind moving to Victoria, please send me an email. All prospective candidates must have a strong background in Python and C/C++. All inquiry emails must contain the string \"Lab 0xTCG\" to be considered. Note: Due to the volume of applications, I will not respond to all received applications (and even if I respond, it will be in late November/early December). If you do not hear back from me by December 15, I suggest applying elsewhere. Please do not send reminder emails. In the past, he was a postdoctoral associate in the Computation and Biology Group at the MIT CSAIL 🇺🇸, under the supervision of prof. Bonnie Berger. Before that, he was a Ph.D. student and a Vanier Scholar in the Computational Biology Lab at Simon Fraser University 🇨🇦 under the supervision of prof. S. Cenk Şahinalp. He completed his undergraduate studies in the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences at the University of Sarajevo 🇧🇦. He originally comes from a beautiful Sarajevo, the capital city of Bosnia and Herzegovina 🇧🇦. Curriculum Vitae My research interests include bioinformatics (with particular emphasis on computational genomics), programming languages, and secure computing. Major projects include Aldy, Codon, Seq, BISER, SCALCE and so on. You can check the papers I co-authored on Google Scholar. If you're interested in more details, please drop me an email.
