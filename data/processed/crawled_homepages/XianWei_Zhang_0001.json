I'm Xianwei, now an Associate Professor (2020 - ) in the School of Computer Science & Engineering at Sun Yat-sen University, where I conduct research on computer architecture and systems towards high-performance and intelligent computing. During 2017-2020, I worked at AMD Inc. (Research & RTG) on architectural and software designs of compute-optimized GPUs. Previously, I completed my Ph.D. (2017) in the Computer Science Department at University of Pittsburgh, and obtained Bachelor's (2011) degree in Software Engineering from Northwestern Polytechnical University.

Check out Yat Compiler! > Research Topics: GPU, Compiling, High-performance Computing, Intelligent Computing, Computer System Grants: National Key R&D Program, NSFC Program, Tencent®/Huawei®/Phytium® Funds My research interests lie broadly on hardware and software co-designs to enhance the performance, efficiency, scalability and usability of computing systems. A particular emphasis is on GPU/heterogeneous computing system design, covering architecture, compilers, runtime, and containers, with a focus on critical aspects such as latency, bandwidth, and portability. I currently lead the arcSYSu (ARChitecture and SYStem Upscaling @ SYSU) research team, which is proudly part of the Interdisciplinary Research Center (xRC), directed by Prof. Yutong Lu and Prof. Nong Xiao. At arcSYSu, I am fortunate to work with a talented team of graduate and undergraduate researchers/interns on cutting-edge research in computing systems. [⭐️ Hiring!] Welcome to join us!
