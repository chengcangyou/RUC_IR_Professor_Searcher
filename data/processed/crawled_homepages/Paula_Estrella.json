I joined FaMAF after finishing my PhD thesis at the School of Translation and Interpretation of the University of Geneva. I was part of the ISSCO/TIM reasearch group and during my thesis I was working on context-based evaluation of machine translation systems, in particular on the Framework for the Evaluation of Machine Translation (FEMTI). Before that, I did my studies here at FaMAF and my masters thesis consisted of the implementation of an statistical machine translation system for websites using freely available tools.",
