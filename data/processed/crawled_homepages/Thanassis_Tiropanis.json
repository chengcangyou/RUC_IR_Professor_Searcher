He is enterprise champion for ECS and impact champion for computer science. He is also affiliated with the Institute for Life Sciences and the Southampton Marine and Maritime Institute at the University. His expertise is in decentralised data architectures, distributed linked data infrastructures, semantic technologies with application in education, and the study of the evolution and impact of the Web and the Internet as socio-technical artefacts. He has over 25 years of research and teaching experience through posts at University College London (UCL), the Athens Information Technology (AIT) institute, and the University of Southampton. He was Visiting Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science, National University of Singapore in 2017-2019. He is a fellow and a chartered IT professional with the BCS, a senior member of IEEE, a fellow of the Higher Education academy in the UK, a member of the ACM and a member of the Technical Chamber of Greece.

He is also interested in sociotechnical approaches to the identification and elimination of bias in datasets and inaccessible algorithms making use of crowdsourcing approaches, and in federated learning in decentralised infrastructures for the identification of cybersecurity threats.
