He is also the CTO of Noiseless Imaging, a company specialized in noise-removal, restoration, and enhancement technology for the imaging industry.His research interests include mathematical and statistical methods for signal processing, functional and harmonic analysis, and computational modeling of the human visual system. His work focuses on adaptive algorithms for the restoration and enhancement of digital images, on noise modeling for imaging devices, and on the optimal design of statistical transformations for the stabilization, normalization, and analysis of random data. He is a Fellow of the IEEE for his contributions to image restoration and noise modeling.He was the Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Transactions on Image Processing from 2021 to 2023. He previously served as a Senior Area Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging and as an Associate Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, the SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences, and the IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging.He is a member of the IEEE TAB/PSPB Products & Services Committee and of the IEEE SPS Technical Directions Board.Homepage PublicationsGoogle Scholar ProfileSelected publicationsPublications Own linksHomepagePublicationsGoogle Scholar Profile",
