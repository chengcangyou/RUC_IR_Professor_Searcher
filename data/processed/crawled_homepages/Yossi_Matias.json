Most notably, my InfoLab projects deal with effective processing of massive data sets. They include the following: Leonardo: sketches and synopses τ-synopses: a system for run-time management of remote synopses Profiler: on-the-fly run-time code profiling Memento: program reversals based on list traversal synopses IPCompress: effective compression in packet networks Sensible Sensing: adaptive probing and communication in sensor networks Hosted Projects Planet Lab @ TAU IAG - Israel Academic Grid Program Committees SIGMOD 2006 - The 2006 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data SIGMOD 2006 (Industrial track) - The 2006 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data - Industrial Track KDD 2006 - The Twelth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining NGITS 2006 - The 6th workshop on Next Generation Information Technologies and Systems KDDS 2005 - The Second International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery from Data Streams FSTTCS 2005 - The 25th Foundations of Software Technology and Theoretical Computer Science Conference KDD 2005 - The Eleventh ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining WWW 2005 - The 14th International World Wide Web Conference ICDT 2005 - Tenth international Conference on Database Theory ICDE 2005 - Twenty First International Conference on Data Engineering XSym 2004 - The Second XML Symposium PODS 2004 - Twenty first ACM Symposium on Principles of Database Systems JPDPS 2003 - JPDPS - Grid Computing SIGMOD 2003 - The 2003 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data Previous conferences Steering Committee IAG - Israel Academic Grid Other activities Internet privacy and spam control Projects @ Bell Labs (old) LPWA: The Lucent Personalized Web Assistant - internet privacy and spam control AQUA: Approximate Query Answering DIGEST: Database Incorporating Guaranteed Estimation Techniques COMPAS: Computational Models for Parallel Systems Courses & Seminars Research seminar: advanced topics on algorithms for massive data sets - data synopses and streaming data (Spring 04) Computer Structure (Fall 03) Workshop on Data Synopses & Planet Lab (Fall 03) Research seminar: advanced topics on algorithms for massive data sets - data synopses and streaming data (Fall 03) : Data Structures (Spring 03) Algorithms for Massive Data Sets (Spring 03) Research seminar: advanced topics on algorithms for massive data sets - data synopses and streaming data (Spring 03) Seminar: Efficient processing of Massive Data Sets (Spring 03) Workshop on Data Synopses (Fall 02) Research seminar: advanced topics on algorithms for massive data sets - data synopses and streaming data (Fall 02) Seminar: Efficient processing of Massive Data Sets (Spring 02) Data Structures (Spring 02) Computer Structure (Spring Workshop in Computer Science (Spring 00) Data Structures (Fall 99/00) Seminar: Data representation and retrieval (Fall 99/00) Parallel Algorithms (Spring 99) Workshop in Computer Science (Spring 99) Seminar: Data representation and retrieval (Fall 98/99) Data Structures (Fall 98/99) Data Structures (Fall 97/98) Seminar: Data structures and algorithms for massive data sets (Spring 98) See also my Stanford home page,",
