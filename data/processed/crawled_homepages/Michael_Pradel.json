Bio I'm a faculty member at the CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security and a full professor in the Computer Science Department of the University of Stuttgart. I'm also faculty member in the International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) for Intelligent Systems (IS) and a member in the Stuttgart ELLIS Unit. Previously, I was an assistant professor at TU Darmstadt, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, and a lecturer and postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zurich, where I completed my Ph.D. on program analyses for automatic and precise error detection. In 2019, I spent a sabbatical at Facebook, Menlo Park. I studied computer science at TU Dresden and engineering at Ecole Centrale Paris, and I visited EPFL for my master thesis. My work has been recognized through the Ernst-Denert Software Engineering Award, an Emmy Noether grant (1.3 million Euro) by the DFG, an ERC Starting Grant (1.5 million Euro), best/distinguished paper awards at FSE (3x), ISSTA, ASE, ASPLOS, and MSR, and by being named an ACM Distinguished Member. Please follow these links for my research, publications, and teaching activities.
