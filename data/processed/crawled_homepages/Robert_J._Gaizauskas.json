Following two years teaching Logic as a temporary lecturer at Carleton he obtained a Diploma in Information Processing from Algonquin College, Ottawa, in 1981.He then worked for several software companies in Ottawa, including Domus Software, Nabu Technologies, and Fulcrum Technologies (now part of Hummingbird), before moving to the U.K. in 1985, thanks to a Canadian SSHRC Doctoral Fellowship and British Council ORS award, to study for a DPhil in the School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences (now the Department of Informatics) at the University of Sussex.He received his MA in Cognitive Studies in 1986 and was awarded his DPhil in 1992. During 1989 he lectured in Artificial Intelligence at Sussex. From 1990 to 1993 he worked as a Research Associate at the University of Sussex.In 1993 he became a Lecturer in the Natural Language Processing Group of the Department of Computer Science, Sheffield University, became a Reader in Computer Science in the same group in 1999, and a Professor in 2002. Research interests Rob's research interests are in natural language processing, specifically in information extraction from natural language texts, software architectures for natural language processing and evaluation of language processing systems.
