I am also affiliated with the department of Engineering and Public Policy in the College of Engineering; am a core faculty member of CyLab, our university-wide security and privacy institute; and have a courtesy appointment in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department. With Ariel Zetlin-Jones and Elaine Shi, I co-direct the Secure Blockchain Initiative, a cross-disciplinary, university-wide initiative to try to go beyond the hype and research technical, economic, and regulatory aspects of cryptocurrencies and derived proposals. I am a 2017 CSIS fellow, and a 2019 Carnegie Institute of Technology Dean Early Career fellow. I received a DiplÃ´me d’IngÃ©nieur (1999) from Ãcole Centrale de Lille, a Master’s (2000) and a Ph.D. (2003) in Computer Science from the University of Virginia. In the final year (2002â2003) of my Ph.D., I was working at Nortel Networks. I then spent two wonderful years (2003â2005) as a postdoctoral fellow in the School of Information at UC Berkeley, before joining Carnegie Mellon in July 2005. I was a faculty-in-residence for three years (2005â2008) at CyLab Japan, the research and education center CMU used to have in KÅbe, which remains one of my favorite cities. After coming back to the US, I served as Associate Director of the Information Networking Institute from 2008 through 2013, as a research faculty (Assistant Research Professor) in Electrical and Computer Engineering from 2013 through 2016, as a research faculty (Associate Research Professor) in my current departments from 2016 through 2019, and subsequently as a tenured Associate Professor from 2019 through 2022. I was the director of the Societal Computing Ph.D. program from 2019 through 2024, in which I remain very active. I am (very sporadically) on Twitter as @nc2y; on Mastodon as ioc.exchange/@nc2y; and on BlueSky as @nc2y.bsky.social. I have (far too) many interests outside of work, which primarily involve engaging in some sort of outdoor activity, away from any computing device (although a good GPS is always useful, given my legendary sense of direction). I am more than happy to discuss them at great lengths in person. Research overview My research interest is in computer and information systems security. Most of my work is at the boundary of systems, networking and policy research. While a good portion of my research activities could be qualified as applied research, I try as much as possible to rely on strong theoretical foundations in my work. In addition, most of my recent work is informed by empirical data measurements (of users, networks, economic transactions, …), so that the term \"security analytics\" is an appropriate short qualifier. More specifically, the different inter-related research threads in which I am currently involved are: [in brackets, some of the venues where we published on the subject] Online crime modeling: Current security attacks are more often than not financially motivated. We postulate that, by getting a more precise picture of the economic interactions between the different actors involved, we can better understand how to disrupt or thwart these attacks. This line of work is very applied, and combines economic modeling, network measurements, and public policy research. [USENIX Sec'24, USENIX Sec'22, WWW'21, KDD'19, USENIX Sec'18, PETS'18, IMC'17, USENIX Sec'15, CCS'14, ESORICS'14, EC'13, WWW'13, CCS'11, USENIX Sec'11, CCS'10, …] Cryptocurrencies and (decentralized) finance: For all the hype about “blockchain solutions,” the most successful use case for this technology remains the original use case, popularized by Bitcoin: cryptocurrencies. In a short few years, cryptocurrencies have become an important player in financial markets, and novel platforms (e.g., “decentralized finance,” or DeFi) have emerged. We have been one of the first groups to look at this from a measurement standpoint, trying to make sense of the overall ecosystem, and understand which lessons we can learn from it that would also apply to traditional finance. [USENIX Sec'25, SIGMETRICS'25, WWW'24, CHI'24, AFT'23, WWW'23, WWW'21, JEP'15, FC'13, …] Usability and security: Making systems more secure has generally been at odds with what humans are good at; for instance, longer passwords are near-impossible to memorize, complex security policies are ignored and therefore useless, and so forth. This has resulted in large security meltdowns. Rather than treating human factors as a constraint in secure system design, we try to exploit what people are skilled at to make systems more secure. For instance, humans can very quickly recognize patterns, make inferences from incomplete information, and respond positively to proper messaging. Our work in that space finds applications in authentication applications, smart password meters, mobile payment systems, automated teller machines, cryptocurrency wallets, to name a few. Software highlights include our open-source Carnegie Mellon password meter, and our neural network-based password cracker. For this work, we won the 2020 Allen Newell Award for research excellence, and the 2023 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy “test-of-time” award for our Oakland'12 paper. [USENIX Sec'25, CCS'20, CHI'19, CHI'18, CHI'17, USENIX Sec'16, CHI'16, USENIX Sec'15, PETS'15, CHI'15, CHI'14, CCS'13, USENIX Sec'12, SOUPS'12, Oakland'12, CHI'11, FC'11, SOUPS'08, CHI'08, …] Continuous worldwide monitoring of online censorship: This line of work aims to continuously understand how governments attempt to control the information their users see, either by blocking access or by injecting specific content to affect public discourse. In particular, on the blocking side, we are very interested in examples of covert censorship, in which the censor silently terminates user connections, as opposed to overt censorship, where the censor explicitly tells users they are attempting to access restricted contents when blocking them. (The latter might be justifiable; the former usually is not, and gives interesting clues on some of the geopolitical dynamics at play.) Measuring interference at scale is incredibly challenging: country policies vary widely, censored pages change all the time, discriminating between random errors and actual malice is hard, and attempting to minimize human involvement to limit actual risk to people is tricky. We partner with ICLab at the University of Massachusetts and the Open Technology Fund in this multi-disciplinary endeavor, that spans computer networking and security, language processing, and even geopolitics. [USENIX Sec'24, PETS'24, WWW'21, Oakland'20, IMC'18, PETS'17] Predictive security analytics: Wouldn’t it be nice if we could foresee security issues before they actually harm users or infrastructure operators? We have shown this might be possible. We have developed systems to proactively detect exposure to attacks, both at the server and at the user levels. This work combines large-scale measurements with machine learning, and is closely related to our work on online crime modeling. [CCS'18, USENIX Sec'14] Security economics: We keep hearing about security attacks and breaches, despite the fact that most security problems have relatively low-cost solutions (e.g., patching, stronger access control, audits). I am interested in 1) understanding why, from an economic standpoint, people and corporations are seemingly either not investing enough in security, or investing in the wrong things, and 2) finding out if there are economic remedies or incentive compatible algorithms, that we, as a society, can use to improve this sad state of affairs. Behavioral economics, game theory as well as system design play a significant role in this cross-disciplinary work. [AAAI'15, IJCAI'13, CSF'11, ESORICS'10, FC'10, EC'08, WWW'08, …] The College of Engineering and the School of Computer Science have both produced slick videos (Engineering, Computer Science) in which I give high-level overviews of what my group is working on. Cross-cutting several of these projects, I have been one of the co-PIs of the Security Behavior Observatory, a longitudinal, in situ user behavior measurement panel. The project is currently not funded anymore, but we are still extensively using this goldmine of data. Our lab has been a contributor to the DHS IMPACT Cybersecurity data portal.
