However, vendor lock-in makes the migration of applications and data across clouds an expensive proposition.The lock-in is especially serious when considering the newtechnology trend of combining cloud with mobile devices.In this paper, we present a domain-specific language (DSL)that is purposely created for generating hybrid applicationsspanning across mobile devices as well as computing clouds.We propose a model-driven development process that makesuse of a DSL to provide sufficient programming abstractionsover both cloud and mobile features. We describe the underlying domain modeling strategy as well as the details ofour language and the tools supporting our approach.

In this paper, we present a Plug-and-Play extension to BLOOMS, which allows to flexibly replace or complement the use of Wikipedia by other online or offline resources, including domain-specific ontologies or taxonomies. By making use of automated translation services and of Wikipedia in languages other than English, it makes it possible to… Show more BLOOMS (Jain et al, ISWC2010) is an ontology alignment system which, in its core, utilizes the Wikipedia category hierarchy for establishing alignments.
