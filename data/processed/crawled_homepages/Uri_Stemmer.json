Recently emerging from the theoretical computer science literature, differential privacy is now in initial stages of implementation and use in various academic, industry, and government settings. Look at your phone for example. Do you think that the manufacturer is \"listening\"? Do you care? Over the last year, big corporations like Google, Apple, and Microsoft have been utilizing differentially private algorithms in order to collect high-quality aggregate information from their users, while guaranteeing their users that no individual-specific information is even being collected.
