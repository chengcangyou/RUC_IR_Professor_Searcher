A micro-architect does all the heavy lifting to squeeze out the best performance out of applications running on computing systems. Biswa is interested in microarchitecture ideas for improving performance and security of modern processors. Biswa is one of the recipients of Qualcomm India Faculty Award 2022, Google India Research Award 2022, Prof. Krithi Ramamritam Award for creative research 2023, Qualcomm Faculty Award 2024, Shridhar Shukla Chair Professor in Digital Trust (2025-2028), USENIX SECURITY 2025 Distinguished Artifact Award, and Class of 1973 Faculty Award for research excellence 2025. Finally, Biswa likes demystifying microarchitecture mysteries in his architecture classes through memes and videos :) Research: Interests, Mission, and Philosophy Research interests: As a mortal I am passionate about CPUs/GPUs for better latency/bandwidth and a bit(not even a byte) of security. Research mission (responsibility): To ensure India's presence on the global map of computer architecture research with top quality publications at the flagship research forums . Research Philosophy: Motivated by this quote on Cricket \"Play Life like a Cricket match. Donât try to hit hard in every situation, Just keep rotating, moving, and then look for that one Delivery and hit it as hard as you can.\" Replace \"life\" with \"research\", \"delivery\" with \"idea\", and \"hit as hard as you can\" with \"the impact\". If you want to do top-quality research aligned with our research mission and philosophy, and you know what it takes to do the same then welcome;looking forward to doing research with you. Gratitude Thanks to all the gurus who taught me the value of hardwork, failure, and inculcated the habit of striving for excellence. Thanks to students@IITK/IITB for some of the best \"teaching/learning\" moments. Thanks to Intel labs, Qualcomm, NXP, and Google Research for all the \"financial\" support.
