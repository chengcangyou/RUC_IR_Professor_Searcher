Gyori is the Sy and Laurie Sternberg Interdisciplinary Associate Professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences and the College of Engineering at Northeastern University, based in Boston. Gyori’s research combines computational modeling, machine learning, natural language processing, and human–machine interaction to improve our understanding of complex human biology, opening doors to advances in healthcare. His interest in the interdisciplinary field of computational systems biology stems from his fascination with mathematical and computational models of natural systems. During his tenure as director of machine-assisted modeling and analysis at Harvard Medical School’s Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology, Gyori was the principal investigator on multiple DARPA-funded research grants; he also led a research team focused on AI-based approaches to modeling and managing biological processes and other complex systems. Throughout, Gyori has sought to create computational frameworks that combine high-throughput data with the biological mechanisms that govern health. In doing so, he has earned DARPA’s Young Faculty, Director’s Fellowship, and Riser Awards, and has published in Molecular Systems Biology, Cell Systems, and Scientific Data, among other journals. Since joining Khoury College in 2023, Gyori has taught data science courses and led several research projects focused on AI approaches to complex systems modeling, biomedical data integration, and accelerating vaccine development with funding from DARPA, DTRA, and the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative. He is an advocate for open science and open-source scientific software, and has mentored a team of scientific software developers and researchers.
