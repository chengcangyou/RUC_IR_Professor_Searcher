Paper titled \"Unsupervised Learning of Neuro-symbolic Rules for Generalizable Context-aware Planning in Object Arrangement Tasks\" appeared in the International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2024. Project web page is: here. Invited talk at the Indo-German Workshop on Frontiers of Robot Learning (FRL 2024) at IIT Bombay (website). Serving as Area Chair for Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL) 2024. Arxiv pre-print available for work on few-shot learning of spatial inductive concepts (paper). This works paves way to teach robots high-level concepts via curriculum training allow a robot to understand, plan and execute instructions that involve making an assembly of objects. This is joint work with Namasivayam Kalithasan, Sachit Sachdeva Himanshu Gaurav Singh Divyanshu Aggarwal, Gurarmaan Singh Panjeta, Vishal Bindal, Arnav Tuli, and Parag Singla. Arxiv pre-print available for work on enabling robots to perform physical reasoning tasks (website). Such tasks are hard for pure RL to learn. Our approach combines physics-informed networks to model individual physical skills with model-based RL to plan in continuous spaces under delayed reward settings. This is joint work with Mudit Agarwal, Abhinav Barnawal, Shreshth Tuli and Souvik Chakraborty. New work on acquiring object models via active physical interaction. The Arxiv paper is here. This work shows how a robot can build a radiance field model (visual and geometric) by actively interacting with an object. Deciding the next action is by estimating model uncertainty as the robot is interacting with an object. Joint work with Saptarshi Dasgupta, Akshat Gupta and Shreshth Tuli. Three papers accepted in the International Conference on Computers Helping People with Special Needs (ICCHP) 2024. We report work on embodied AI device for aiding a visually challenged person in correct use of a sensor-mounted cane (LNCS track). The second work presents a novel system to aid 3D shape perception for a blind student (OAC Track). Further, we address accessibility challenges in enabling blind students to code introduction to programming exercises (for a COL100 course I co-taught last year). Our contribution is in enabling access to error/debug messages that appear in the terminal window as well as visual cues (like making patterns) for them to write correct code. This work appears in the innovation track in ICCHP. Four workshop papers accepted at ICRA 2024. These papers report emerging work on zero-shot scene graph generation for robot plan execution, unsupervised 3D scene graph generation for outdoor manipulation, active learning of NeRF-based object models and robot instruction following with temporal reasoning. Paper titled \"GoalNet: Inferring Conjunctive Goal Predicates from Human Plan Demonstrations for Robot Instruction Following\" to appear in AAAI 2024. The arxiv version is here. This work is motivated with the problem of teaching robots a generalized representation for what a task essentially means. We present a method that allows a robot to observe human demonstrations and infer the essential relationships that must be true for a task to be considered complete. Work on development of intelligent robotic team mate to aid security persons showcased at IInventive 2024 at IIT Hyderabad (article). We demonstrate a high-level autonomy task that allows a mobile manipulator to take in a high-level instruction and perform a multi-step interaction task under partial world knowledge.
