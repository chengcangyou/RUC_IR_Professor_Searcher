I am an associate professor in the computer science and engineering department at the University of South Carolina (USC). My research involves advancing the state-of-the-art in AI/ML by developing novel algorithms and methods for solving some outstanding problems in: - Sustainable AI [funded by NSF]: We have several ongoing projects on sustainable AI, including ML Inference Pipeline Adaptation, to find the right tradeoff between High Accuracy, Cost-Efficiency, and Sustainability. We also develop design strategies and patterns that developers can use to build sustainability into their system as an explicit goal. - Autonomous Systems and Robotics [funded by NASA]: e.g. (i) Our work on Autonomy for space lander missions to the Ocean Worlds, such as Europa and Enceladus. Our project, RASPBERRY-SI, in collaboration with CMU, UArk, the University of York, as well as testbed providers: NASA JPL (physical testbed, called OWLAT) and NASA Ames (virtual testbed, called OceanWATERS). (ii) our recent project on developing a framework for designing Modular Autonomy on ROS (MARS). - Causal Reasoning [funded by NSF and Google]: e.g., (i) Our work on causal reasoning for performance debugging and optimizations in computer systems (Distributed, Hardware-Software, ML Pipelines), in collaboration with Christian Kaestner (CMU) and Baishakhi Ray (Columbia). (ii) As a former visiting researcher at Google, I worked on causal representation learning, enhancing the explainability of learned representation in deep neural networks via causal features for large-scale systems that rely on such representations for automated decision-making. - Sciences and Engineering [looking for funding!]: e.g., (i) Our collaborative work on causal learning for cancer research in collaboration with Phillip Buckhaults (USC's College of Pharmacy) and optimal vaccine promotion for COVID-19 in collaboration with Gregory Trevors (USC's College of Education). (ii) Our collaborative work on deep learning for symbolic mathematics in collaboration with Kallol Roy (University of Estonia). I am particularly interested in the theoretical foundations of Causal Representation Learning, Adversarial ML, AutoML, and Transfer Learning. In addition to theory, I am excited about Sustainable AI, ML for Systems, and Systems for ML. Before joining the faculty at the University of South Carolina, I was a postdoc in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University (USA), working with Christian Kaestner, and, before that, I was a postdoc in the Department of Computing at Imperial College London (UK). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Dublin City University (Ireland), and my advisor was Claus Pahl. I received an M.S. degree (research-based) in Systems Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology (Iran) in 2006, and my advisor was Saeed Mansour. I also received a B.S. in Math & Computer Science from the Amirkabir University of Technology (Iran) in 2003. Important Links Update [deadline: 2025/05/30]: I am hiring a postdoctoral researcher in Systems (ML for Systems and Systems for ML), Robotics, or Causal AI in my group at the University of South Carolina. There are excellent opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration, including with colleagues in the Department of Mathematics working on data science, AI foundations, optimization, and graph theory. Applicants must have a Ph.D. (or have submitted their dissertation) by the start date and must be U.S. citizens, nationals, or permanent residents due to funding restrictions. If you are interested, please contact me. As of January 2023, I do not plan to hire new Ph.D. students until further notice and I am so sorry that I may not be able to answer prospective student emails asking for available positions at AISys. You are always welcome to apply for a master’s or Ph.D. degree at the department. If you are selected for such a graduate program in our department, you will have the opportunity to apply for an assistantship (teaching or research) to help cover your stipend and tuition, either at the department (teaching) or within specific laboratories directed by our faculties (research). Depending on common research interests, you will also have the opportunity to reach out to our faculties to find the best match for mentoring. With Vijay Chidambaram, Romain Jacob, Neeraja J. Yadwadkar, and Ivo Jimenez, we co-founded JSys—a new diamond open-access journal for the systems community. I also co-chair two areas at JSys: Computer Architecture (with Devashree Tripathy) and Configuration Management (with Tianyin Xu). Please consider submitting your research work to JSys!

News 11/17/25 I am honored to be selected as one of the ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing 2025's distinguished reviewers. Thank you, SoCC'25! 01/15/25 I’m thrilled and humbled to share that I’ve been recommended for tenure and promotion to the rank of Associate Professor at the University of South Carolina! This achievement is not mine alone—it reflects the unwavering support, love, and encouragement I’ve received from my family, friends, mentors, colleagues, and students. My family’s strength and belief in me have been my foundation throughout this journey, and I couldn’t have reached this milestone without them. I’m deeply grateful for this opportunity to continue teaching, learning, and growing in my role. Here’s to the next chapter of pushing boundaries and exploring new possibilities together! 05/07/24 Saeid Ghafouri wrote a blog post about his amazing project at AISys, in particular, about how he has done extensive experiments using Chameleon cloud resources: Optimizing Production ML Inference for Accuracy and Cost Efficiency. 04/15/24 IPA: Inference Pipeline Adaptation to Achieve High Accuracy and Cost-Efficiency, has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Systems Research (JSys)!
