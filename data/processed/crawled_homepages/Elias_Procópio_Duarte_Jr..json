Use a k-core! [journal] [pdf] [bibtex] Understand the Impact of Network Neutrality on Innovation: [journal] [pdf] [bibtex] Research Interests Research interests include Computer Networks and Distributed Systems, in particular their Dependability and Algorithms -- in this webpage you can find a few research highlights. Here is my DBLP page and my Google Scholar page. I have been currently working on the dependability of programmable/virtualized networks, Internet-based distributed systems, resilient routing, and distributed intelligence. Other topics of current interest include network neutrality, reachability and stability. Here is a list of funded research projects; here is a list of research awards received, here are the teaching awards, and here are the publications.
