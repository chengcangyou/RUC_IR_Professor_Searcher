My research interests include fault-tolerant distributed systems, designing systems for RDMA networks, and privacy and security in distributed systems. You can read more about my current research projects on the research page. I received my PhD in Computer Science from Cornell University in 2020, where I worked with Professor Ken Birman. Previously, I attended Brown University, where I graduated in 2013 with an Sc.B. with Honors in Computer Science. You can download my complete CV here, if you want to see the details of anything summarized on this website. Pronouncing my name: My last name is pronounced “TRE-muhl,” with the accent on the first syllable, not “tre-MEL.” I think this mistake is common because the name looks French, and in French the accent would indeed be on the second syllable, but it’s actually a German name.
