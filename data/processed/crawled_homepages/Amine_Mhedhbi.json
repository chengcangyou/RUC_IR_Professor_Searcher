I am an associate academic member of Mila (Québec AI Institute) and IVADO (Data Valorisation Institute). I hold an FRQ-IVADO research chair in multimodal data engineering. I also serve as a technical advisor to some companies.My research spans all aspects of data and information management and overlaps with the research communities: VLDB, ACM SIGMOD, IEEE TCDE, and CIDR. I focus on analytical and AI-driven data system architectures, e.g., Flock and previously GraphflowDB and its successor Kùzu.Earlier, I started the applied research team at Distyl AI helping to drive some of their earliest solutions for F500 enterprise workflows. Prior to that, I received my PhD from the School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. I also completed two research internships at Microsoft Research.NewsShow older newsSep 2025Awarded the FRQ-IVADO research chair in multimodal data engineering.
