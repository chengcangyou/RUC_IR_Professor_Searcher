I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Rice University, where I direct the Robotics and Physical Interactions Lab (RobotΠ Lab). I am broadly interested in robotic systems that can physically interact with other robots, people, and the world. By developing algorithms in optimization, planning, learning, estimation, and control, my research is focused on efficient, robust, and generalizable manipulation systems, addressing problems that range from small scale grasping and in-hand manipulation, to large scale dual-arm manipulation, mobile manipulation, and multi-robot manipulation. Before joining Rice CS, I finished my postdoc at Yale University, completed my Ph.D./M.Sc. at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, and received my B.Eng. from Xi'an Jiaotong University. News 2025-10-08 We are proud to announce ManipulationNet to benchmark YOUR robot, at YOUR place, and at ANY time! 2025-06-15 We have 5 papers accepted for publication in IEEE/RSJ IROS. Check out the preprints here! We look forward to presenting our research and discussing with colleagues in Hangzhou! 2025-05-09 We are organizing the Workshop on Benchmarking via Competitions in Robotic Grasping and Manipulation - 2nd edition at IEEE/RSJ IROS 2025 in Hangzhou, China, on October 20. We look forward to seeing everyone in the workshop! 2025-03-14 We are organizing the 10th Robotic Grasping and Manipulation Competition (RGMC) at IEEE-RAS ICRA 2025 in Atlanta, USA, on May 19-22. Dr. Hang is the lead organizer of the In-Hand Manipulation Competition (Sub-Track 2) within the Essential Skill Track. We look forward to seeing everyone in the competition! 2024-11-19 Kaiyu Hang awarded ASME Rising Star of Mechanical Engineering and presented his work at the award ceremony in the 2024 International Mechanical Engineering Congress & Exposition (ASME IMECE), Portland, Oregon, USA. 2023-06-29 Kaiyu Hang has won a National Science Foundation CAREER Award to develop robots that can physically interact with the world through compliance- and motion-based manipulation funnels.
