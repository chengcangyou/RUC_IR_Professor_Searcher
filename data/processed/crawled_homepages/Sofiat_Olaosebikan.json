I completed my PhD (awarded July 2020) in Computing Science from the University of Glasgow, under the supervision of Prof David Manlove. My work leveraged graph-theoretic tools and optimisation techniques to aid the design of efficient algorithms for matching problems. My thesis is entitled The Student-Project Allocation Problem: Structure and Algorithms. Prior to this, I obtained an MSc in Mathematical Sciences from the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) in 2015, and a BSc in Mathematics from the University of Ibadan in 2012. My journey from being a major in mathematics to becoming a researcher in computing science is fuelled by my passion for problem solving and programming. My ongoing work focusses on the design of efficient algorithms for open problems in matching theory. I have published my research findings in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and I have presented my work at several international conferences. In 2023, I was endorsed as an Exceptional Promise under the UK Global Talent by the Royal Academy of Engineering. On the outreach side, I am founder and lead of Computer Science Academy Africa (CSA Africa) - an initiative aimed at empowering young Africans with computing skills. So far, my team and I have received funding of over £120,000, which has enabled us train over 500 participants via our Python programming workshops in Nigeria (2018 and 2022), Rwanda (2019), and online (2021). In recognition of the transformational change engineered by this initiative, I was named as a University of Glasgow Future World Changer in 2018. In addition, I was selected as one of the Highly Commended Finalist, Top 50 Women in Engineering 2022: Inventors and Innovators - awarded by the Womens' Engineering Society. Research interests I am motivated by research problems arising from practical applications. Within the School, I am a member of the Formal Analysis, Theory and Algorithms (FATA) research group. My interests include: algorithms design using graph theory; stable matchings; combinatorial optimisation; computational complexity; algorithm engineering; experimentation. In addition to my research on matching problems, I have worked with researchers in the School of Engineering at the University of Glasgow, on the design of efficient algorithms for future wireless communications. Moreover, I am also currently working on bridging the gap between reinforcement learning and matching theory.Research groupsFormal Analysis, Theory & Algorithms Publications List by: Type | Date Jump to: 2026 | 2022 | 2020 | 2018Number of items: 8.2026 Ayegba, Peace, Olaosebikan, Sofiat ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8003-7887 and Manlove, David ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6754-7308 (2026) Structural aspects of the Student Project Allocation problem.
