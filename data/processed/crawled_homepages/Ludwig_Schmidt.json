Allen School for Computer Science & Engineering Research focus Datasets, machine learning, reliable methods Education Ph.D. Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2018 M.S. Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2013 B.A. Computer Science, University of Cambridge, 2011 Ludwig Schmidt joins the Allen School from his roles as postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley and visiting research scientist in the robotics team at Toyota Research. His research interests revolve around the empirical and theoretical foundations of machine learning, often with a focus on reliable methods, datasets and evaluation paradigms. Schmidt’s research has led to more robust classification algorithms and new datasets and principles to probe the generalization capabilities of neural networks. Schmidt is the recipient of a Google Ph.D. Fellowship, a Microsoft Simons Fellowship, a Best Paper Award from the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), and a Sprowls Dissertation Award from MIT.",
