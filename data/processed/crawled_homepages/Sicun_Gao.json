I focus on topics that can benefit from the combinatorial perspectives of automated reasoning but are posed in numerical or statistical forms. The end goal is to build useful forms of automation and autonomy that are fundamentally reliable yet aggressively optimized. Colloquially, I spend much time dealing with the curse of dimensionality and finding needles in haystacks.
