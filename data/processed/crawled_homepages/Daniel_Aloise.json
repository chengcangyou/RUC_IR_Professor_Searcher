I did my Ph.D. advised by Pierre Hansen on exact methods for the minimum sum-of-squares problem (aka k-means clustering). I have also been a professor at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, since 2009. My research interests include data mining, machine learning, optimization, mathematical programming and how these disciplines interact to tackle problems in our Big Data era. I have published in leading operations research and data mining journals including Machine Learning, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, European Journal of Operational Research, Mathematical Programming and Journal of Global Optimization.

By combining processes for analyzing highly targeted data and real-time decision-making, their mathematical model-based tools will help organizations improve performance, by creating highly customized outputs and taking into account the environments, needs and individual behaviors of their clients or users. The applications that result will foster new business models that are based on accurate depictions of user behaviors and expectations, combined with competitorsâ responses. The many sectors that could benefit include transportation management, energy, health care and manufacturing, as well as supply chain management and logistics. Since 2005 Group For Research In Decision Analysis GERAD is a multi university research center founded in 1979. It involves some seventy experts from a mix of disciplines: quantitative methods for management, operations researchers, computer scientists, mathematicians and mathematical engineers, from HEC MontrÃ©al, Polytechnique MontrÃ©al, McGill University and UniversitÃ© du QuÃ©bec Ã  MontrÃ©al.",
