Recruiting PhD students supported by TA/RA! Please send your resume to pwu7@uh.edu Bio: I'm currently an associate professor in CS@UH. I joined CS@UH in 2018 as an asssitant professor. I was a post-doctoral research associate in Innovative Computing Laboratory (ICL), University of Tennessee led by Prof. Jack Dongarra. Earlier I did my Ph.D. in computer science at University of California Riverside advised by Prof. Zizhong Chen. Even earlier I did my B.S. in mathematics at Univesisty of Science and Technology of China (USTC).
