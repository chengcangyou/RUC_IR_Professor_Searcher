My research has spanned program analysis; semantics; verification and model-checking; security; logic; complexity; and algorithms.Together with Mike Hicks and Leo Lampropoulos, I direct the laboratory for Programming Languages at the University of Maryland (PLUM). Previously, I’ve worked with the Programming Research Laboratory (PRL) at Northeastern University.I currently serve as the faculty advisor to Technica, the largest hackathon for underrepresented genders in the world, and as an Advisory Board member for the SIGPLAN Long-Term Mentoring Committee (SIGPLAN-M), an international long-term mentoring program for programming languages researchers.I co-authored the book Realm of Racket with Matthias Felleisen and undergraduates from Northeastern University, which introduces programming interactive video games.NewsNew paper: A Formal Model of Checked C to appear at CSF'22.I'm serving on the PLDI 2022 Program Committee.I'm serving on the Advisory Board of the SIGPLAN Long-Term Mentoring Committee (SIGPLAN-M).New paper: RbSyn: Type- and Effect-Guided Program Synthesis to appear at PLDI'21.New paper: Corpse Reviver: Sound and Efficient Gradual Typing via Contract Verification to appear at POPL'21.Abstracting Abstract Machines, which appeared at ICFP 2010, has won The ICFP Most Influential Paper award at ICFP 2020.I'm speaking at The Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop @ ICFP 2020.I'm lecturing at The Cornell, Maryland, Max Planck Pre-doctoral Research School 2020.I'm serving as a faculty advisor to Technica, the world's largest all-women and non-binary hackathon.New paper: Size-Change Termination as a Contract to appear at PLDI'19.New paper: Type-Level Computations for Ruby Libraries to appear at PLDI'19.I received a 2019 NSF CAREER Award for Gradual Verification: From Scripting to Proving.Gradual Liquid Type Inference won a Distinguished Paper award at OOPSLA 2018!I'm teaching a new Terps Young Scholar course in Summer 2019: Make Your Own Video Games: An Introduction to Programming and Computing.I'm co-organizing PLMW @ ICFP, the Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop, co-located with ICFP 2019 in Berlin, Germany.I'm serving on the OOPSLA 2019 Review Committee.New paper: Gradual Liquid Type Inference to appear at OOPSLA'18 in Boston.New paper: Theorem Proving for All to appear at Haskell 2018 in St. Louis, MO.I served on the thesis committee Quentin StiÃ©venart's dissertation, Scalable Designs for Abstract Interpretation of Concurrent Programs: Application to Actors and Shared-Memory Multi-Threading.I'm co-organizing PLMW @ ICFP, the Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop, co-located with ICFP 2018 in St. Louis, MO.I'm serving on the Selection Committee for the Student Research Competition at both PLDI and ICFP 2018.My post-doc, Thomas Gilray, will be joining the faculty of the Computer Science department at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.New paper: Soft Contract Verification for Higher-order Stateful Programs published at POPL'18 in Los Angeles, USA.",
