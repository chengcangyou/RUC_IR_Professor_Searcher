Topics include how computer use affects social and work relationships and the uses of computers in society. These will be reviewed in the context of risks, privacy and intrusion, computer crime, intellectual property, and professional decision-making. Students analyze scenarios that allow them to view ethical decision-making as a crucial part of understanding the world of computing.

CIS 464: Computer Game Design Science, technology, and art involved in the creation of computer games. A variety of software technologies relevant to games including programming languages, scripting languages, networks, simulation engines, and multimedia design systems are discussed along with underlying scientific concepts from computer science and related fields including simulation and modeling, graphics, artificial intelligence, real-time processing, and game theory. The art and design principles for developing usable and engaging games including software engineering, human computer interaction, thematic structure, graphic design, choreography, music and sound effects, and game aesthetics are introduced and compared. CIS 498: Senior Software Eng Proj I Part I of two-semester sequence of team development of a software product for a specific customer. This capstone project utilizes and integrates knowledge and skills acquired through study of software engineering. Provides hands-on experience with large-scale problem from conception to implementation of the solution. Is conducted in a framework of well-defined low-ceremony software process. The lecture covers software engineering models, quality management, risk management, and provides introduction to software processes. Technical, logistical, and social issues associated with software development are addressed.
