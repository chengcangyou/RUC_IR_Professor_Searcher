My research interests are broadly in systems and networking, with a recent focus on improving large-scale machine learning (generative and predictive, cloud and edge) and video platforms in terms of performance, resource efficiency, affordability, and/or ease of use. My research has been recognized with a Sloan Research Fellowship, the SIGCOMM Rising Star Award, an NSF CAREER Award, multiple industry faculty research awards, and an IRTF Applied Networking Research Prize. Prior to joining Princeton, I was an Assistant Professor at UCLA from 2019-2021. Even earlier, I received a Ph.D. from MIT in 2018, and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University in 2012. Students If you are interested in working with me, please apply to the Princeton CS graduate program, and mention my name in your application. If you are already at Princeton, please send me an email and we can find a time to meet.
