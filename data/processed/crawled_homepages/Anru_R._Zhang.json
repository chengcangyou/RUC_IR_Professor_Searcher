I was an assistant professor of statistics at UW-Madison before joining Duke. I received my Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 2015 (advised by T. Tony Cai) and my Bachelor's degree in mathematics from Peking University in 2010. I serve as Associate Chair for Research at the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics at Duke; Associate Editor for the Annals of Statistics; Associate Editor for Journal of the American Statistical Association (Applications & Case Studies); Associate Editor for Journal of the American Statistical Association (Theory & Methodology); Associate Editor for Statistica Sinica; Associate Editor for Statistics and Its Interface; Area Chair for 2023, 2024 International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR); Some key words of my research: tensor learning, generative models, high-dimensional statistics, electronic health records, healthcare, microbiome studies, ... You can find a list of our group's publications from the tab above, on arXiv, or on Google Scholar. I won the COPSS Emerging Leader Award (2024), IMS Tweedie Award (2022), as featured in IMS News, the ASA Gottfried E. Noether Junior Award (2021), as featured here, the NSF CAREER Award (2020), and the AMIA Data Science Outstanding Paper Award (2023) (News). At Duke, I have been recognized as the Eugene Anson Stead, Jr. M.D. Associate Professor. For prospective Ph.D. students: Please apply to the Ph.D. programs in Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, Computer Science, Electrical & Computer Engineering, or CBB Program. Prospective Ph.D. students interested to work with me can mention this on their applications. Applying to multiple programs at Duke increases your chance and is allowed. Our group is actively looking for motivated members to work on (1) methodology and theory in machine learning and statistics and/or (2) applications in AI Health. News [10/2025] Our paper Why Do Transformers Fail to Forecast Time Series In-Context? was selected as oral presentation (3 out of 68 submissions) for What Can('t) Transformers Do? @ NeurIPS 2025. [4/2025] My former PhD advisee, Yuetian Luo, has accepted an offer to become a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the Department of Statistics, Rutgers University. Congratulations! [2/2025] The former visiting student in our group, Jingyang Li, has accepted a position as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics & Data Science at the School of Management, Fudan University, starting in January 2026.
