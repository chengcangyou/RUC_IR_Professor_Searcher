If you are interested please send me an email along with your CV and references (if available). About I am a faculty member in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. I am interested in various aspects of foundations of computer science with an emphasis on cryptography. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Cornell Tech, hosted by Prof. Rafael Pass and Prof. Elaine Shi. Priori to that, I completed my Ph.D. at the Weizmann Institute of Science, where I was fortunate to have Prof. Moni Naor as my advisor. I received my M.Sc. from the Weizmann Institute under the guidance of Prof. Ran Raz. Students & Postdocs Youlong Ding (M.Sc, January '24 -- ) Shay Gadot (M.Sc, Oct.
