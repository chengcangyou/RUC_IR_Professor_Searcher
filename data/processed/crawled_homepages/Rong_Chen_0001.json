I earned my Bachelor's (2000), Master's (2004), and Ph.D (2011) degrees (Advisor: Prof. Binyu Zang) in computer science, all from Fudan University. My research interests include operating systems, distributed systems, and hardware-software co-design, with a current focus on building high-performance, scalable, and working systems for emerging AI-powered applications, from cloud to edge. My work has been recognized by Best Paper Awards from EuroSys (2024 and 2015), APSys (2017), and ICPP (2007), as well as the Huawei OlympusMons Pioneer Award (2020). I am both an ACM Distinguished Member and a CCF Distinguished Member. I am currently seeking self-motivated students with good backgrounds in systems-related areas. Please send me an email if you are interested in working with me.
