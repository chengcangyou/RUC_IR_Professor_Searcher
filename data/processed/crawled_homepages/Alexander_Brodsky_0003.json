He received his B.Math in computer science from the University of Waterloo, Canada in 1997 and his M.Sc. in computer science from the University of British Columbia, Canada in 1999. Between 2003 and 2005 he was a post-doctoral fellow at the Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, where he investigated the implementation of various shared memory objects in synchronous and asynchronous systems. Between 2005 and 2009 he was an assistant professor at the University of Winnipeg. He is presently an instructor in the Faculty of Computer Science at Dalhousie University.
