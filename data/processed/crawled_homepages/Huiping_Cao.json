Box 30001 1290 Frenger Mall SH 123 Las Cruces, NM 88003-8001 I obtained my Ph.D. from Department of Computer Science, The University of Hong Kong (HKU) in 2007, and my master's and bachelor degrees from School of Information, Renmin University of China (RUC) in 2002 and 1999 respectively. My research interests are in the general areas of data mining, big data, and applied machine learning. In particular, I am interested in creating effective and efficient computational methodologies for the discovery of useful knowledge from complex data (e.g., sequences and graphs) through pre-defined mining requests or ad-hoc queries. My full curriculum vitae can be found here. Research interests Data mining: knowledge discover from complex data including time series (e.g., spatiotemporal data, sensor data) and graph-structured data (e.g., social networks, transportation networks) Applied machine learning: probabilistic graphical models, deep neural networks, recommender systems Data engineering: graph search, data integration Application domains: smart grids, high performance computing, agriculture, environmental sciences Students The student information in our group can be found from here.
