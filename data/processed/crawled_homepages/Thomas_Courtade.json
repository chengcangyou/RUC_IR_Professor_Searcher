Before joining Berkeley in January 2014, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the NSF Center for Science of Information, and spent much of that time at Stanford University. I received my Ph.D. from UCLA in 2012. My research interests are in the area of information theory, broadly defined. In particular, my research efforts over the past few years have included topics in core Shannon theory (e.g., capacity and rate-distortion theorems), computational biology (e.g., algorithms for DNA assembly and compression of sequencing data), and I have recently been exploring connections between information measures, functional analysis and probability theory (e.g., information inequalities and statistical limit theorems). My research is supported by NSF, a NSF CAREER award, a Hellman Fellowship, and the Fonds France-Berkeley fund. I am faculty coordinator of the BLISS Seminar Series.

Nevertheless, if you have a strong quantitative background and think your interests are compatible with mine, please feel free to contact me. Add .berkeley.edu to any incomplete email address.
