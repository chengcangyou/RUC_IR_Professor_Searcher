In those areas I have contributed to methodologies (i.e., steps to follow to create a solution system from requirements to implementation); models for agent systems (i.e., how to represent solutions) and agent programing languages (i.e., how to implement solutions). I strongly believe in research translation to practical applications. I have collaborated with a wide range of government agencies and industrial partners to solve real-world problems in domains such as energy management, logistics, human-AI interaction and more.
