I received my Ph.D. degree in computer science from SJTU in 2020, advised by Prof. Haibo Chen. My research mainly focuses on building runtime systems for various scenarios, such as AI systems, cloud services, and mobile devices. Currently, I am also interested in building systems for new scenarios like AI-for-Science and mobile agents. I am looking for self-motivated students interested in building high-performance and reliable runtime systems.
