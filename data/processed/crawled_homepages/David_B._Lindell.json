Lindell I’m an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto, a faculty affiliate at the Vector Institute, a faculty fellow at AXL, and a founding member of the Toronto Computational Imaging Group. My research focuses on physically based intelligent sensing: a paradigm that combines physically based models, signal processing, and artificial intelligence to break the limits of current sensing systems and re-think how we reconstruct the world from captured visual information. Along these lines I’ve worked on techniques to image around corners and through scattering media as well as machine learning algorithms to represent, reconstruct, and generate the appearance and geometry of 3D scenes. My work is relevant to a broad range of applications in computational imaging, computer graphics, computer vision, and remote sensing. news Jun 14, 2024 Neural Inverse Rendering from Propagating Light received the best student paper award at CVPR 2025!
