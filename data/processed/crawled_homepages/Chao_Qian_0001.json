After finishing my PhD, I became an associate researcher in the School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, until 2019, when I returned to Nanjing University as an associate professor in the School of Artificial Intelligence. In 2024, I became a full professor. I visited the University of the Basque Country (Spain) and the University of Birmingham (UK). I am also a member of LAMDA Group. [Research Interest] [Recent News] [Publications] [Awards] [Students] [Professional Activities] [Teaching] [Short Bio] [ä¸­æç®å] Research Interest My research interests include artificial intelligence, evolutionary computation and machine learning. Now I am working on Theoretical analysis of evolutionary algorithms Designing safe evolutionary algorithms, i.e., evolutionary algorithms with provable approximation guarantee Designing efficient black-box optimization algorithms, e.g., Bayesian optimization, evolutionary strategies, quality-diversity, evolutionary gradient optimization, and cooperative coevolution algorithms Learning to optimize, e.g., learning to configure, generate and select black-box optimzition algorithms, offline optimization, and neural combinatorial optimization Evolutionary learning, particularly evolutionary reinforcement learning, deep learning, and ensemble learning Applications to solve complex real-world optimziation problems in industry (e.g., electronic design automation) and science (e.g., geoscience) Recent News I gave a keynote talk \"Evolutionary Learning: From Theory to Practice\" [Slides] [ä¸­æç] at the 16th Spanish Congress on Metaheuristics, Evolutionary and Bioinspired Algorithms (MAEB 2025) I have been invited to be a Program Co-Chair of the 22nd Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI 2025) I have been invited to be an Editorial Board member of Artificial Intelligence I have been invited to be an Editorial Board member of Evolutionary Computation I have been invited to be an Associate Editor of IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation I have been invited to be an Associate Editor of IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine I have been invited to give an Early Career Spotlight Talk \"Towards Theoretically Grounded Evolutionary Learning\" at IJCAI 2022 I gave an invited talk \"Why Do We Need Theoretical Research of Evolutionary Algorithms?\" at ECOLE 2023 [Slides] I gave a tutorial \"Pareto Optimization for Subset Selection: Theories and Practical Algorithms\" at ACM GECCO 2025 and IEEE CEC 2025 I was invited to attend the Dagstuhl Seminar \"Theory of Randomized Optimization Heuristics\" Our works on chip placement have won 21st Annual Humies (Human Competitive Results) Bronze Awards (presented at ACM GECCO 2024, Melbourne, Australia), and a Best Paper Award of DATE 2025 (Lyon, France) Our AI4Science work \"Reducing the Uncertainty in Estimating Soil Microbial Derived Carbon Storage\" has published at Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), which was selected as one of the top ten scientific and technological advancements in China's ecological environment in 2024 (å ¥é2024å¹´åº¦ä¸­å½çæç¯å¢åå¤§ç§æè¿å±ï¼ Our works on offline black-box optimization were reported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (ææè¢«å½å®¶èªç¶ç§å­¦åºéå§æ¥é) Publications Book Zhi-Hua Zhou, Yang Yu, and Chao Qian.
