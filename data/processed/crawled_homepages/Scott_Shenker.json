Scott spent his academic youth studying theoretical physics but soon gave up chaos theory for computer science. Continuing to display a remarkably short attention span, his research over the years has wandered from performance modeling and networking to game theory and economics. Unable to focus on any single topic, his current research projects include various topics in networking, system design, and privacy mechanisms. However, despite all these distractions and many decades of therapy, he has never overcome his obsession with Internet architecture. Unable to hold a steady job, he currently splits his time between the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) and the UC Berkeley Computer Science Division. He is indebted to his many collaborators for inspiring him intellectually while patiently enduring his terrible sense of humor and his tyrannical approach to collaborative writing.
