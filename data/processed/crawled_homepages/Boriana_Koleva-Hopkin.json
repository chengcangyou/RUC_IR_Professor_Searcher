Families and mobile devices in museums: designing for integrated experiences Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage. View all publications Current ResearchDr Koleva's main research area is the field of Human Computer Interaction with a particular emphasis on mixed reality interfaces. She has been developing the technique of mixed reality boundaries-a new way of joining together physical and virtual spaces, and more specifically extending the usability of this technology by developing a framework of properties that can be associated with boundaries. Dr Koleva has worked with artists to explore how mixed reality technology can be used to support new forms of interactive art, for example with the Blast Theory performance group on the BAFTA nominated event installation Desert Rain and with Ken Feingold on the installation Sance Box No.1. Dr Koleva is currently involved in developing new mixed reality technologies for public settings (such as museums and schools) and for domestic environments. She is also interested in developing conceptual frameworks and software toolkits to help us better understand and construct mixed reality environments.
