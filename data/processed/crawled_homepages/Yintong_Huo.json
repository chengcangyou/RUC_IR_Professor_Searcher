Hiring🔥: I am hiring fully-funded Ph.D. students (starting from 26Fall), RAs, and visiting students (e.g., CSC-funded). Prospective students please refer to Openings🔥. Established in 2000, SMU now ranks No. 2 globally in Software Engineering in CSRanking (2020-2025). I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in Computer Science at Singapore Management University (SMU). Prior to that, I received my PhD degree at the Computer Science and Engineering Department of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) advised by Prof. Michael R. Lyu. I received my Bachelor's degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. My research focuses on intelligent software engineering, which empowers AI models (LLMs) for software development, testing, and operations. 🌍 Two projects to outline my current research interests: AIOps (LogPAI): An open-source AI platform for automated log analysis [LogHub] | [LogHub-2.0] Multimodal LLM for SE (WebPAI): A multimodal intelligence project on automatic webpage development [DCGen] | [Interaction2Code] | [DesignBench] NEWS 🆕🔥 We release WebPAI: the first multimodal intelligence project on UI code generation, involving static page generation and dynamic page generation! Feel free to share (contribute) your thoughts on this project :) [Recent Services] Invited to serve on PC committee for ASE'25, ICSE'26, FSE'26, ISSTA'26, ICPE'26, AIWare'25. Look forward to great submissions! [2025/10] 🏆 I received the Google Academic Research Award 2025! [2025/10] 🆚 The larger, the better? We study how does the size of LLMs affect their capability in logging, accepted by TOSEM! [2025/09] 🌴 One paper about UI code editing is accepted by AIWare'25. This achievement comes after a productive three-month summer collaboration with SMU senior student Dang. I look forward to future contributions from talented SMU students :) [2025/08] ✨ The first paper about generating code for dynamic webpage from a prototype is accepted by ASE'25 (113/1,190, 9.5%). See you in Seoul🇰🇷 [2025/08] 🤖 The first paper about in-depth agent framework analysis with a three-tier failure taxonomy is accepted by ASE'25-NIER. This work was completed while Ruofan was my (junior undergrad) summer student. Congratulations to Ruofan! [2025/06] 🎆 One paper about configuration logging for improving system diagnosability has been directly accepted by ICSE'26 (60/660, 9%). [2025/04] 🎆 One paper about logging quality assurance has been accepted by TOSEM'25. [2025/04] ✨ One paper about UI code generation (Divide-and-Conquer: Generating UI Code from Screenshots) has been accepted by FSE'25 Research Track. [2025/04] I will attend ICSE 2025 in Ottawa, Canada, FSE 2025 in Trondheim, Norway, and NII Shonan Meeting in Japan (No. 222). If you will be at either of these events and would like to connect, please reach out. [2025/03] 🏆 Hornored to receive ICSE'25 Distinguished Reviewer Award. [2025/01] I'm starting my new career at SMU! [2024/10] One paper is accepted by TSE'24. [2024/09] 🏆 Honored to receive the ISSRE'24 Distinguished Reviewer Award (one of the 4 reviewers this year) Miscellaneous I believe in slow science. I like hiking, playing squash, and taking photographs in my spare time.",
