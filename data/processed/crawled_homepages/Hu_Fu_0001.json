The institute is part of the School of Computing and Artificial Intelligence. I received my PhD from the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University, under the supervision of Professor Robert Kleinberg . I was then a postdoc at Microsoft Research, New England Lab, and later at Caltech, Computing and Mathematical Sciences. I was assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science of the University of British Columbia from 2016 to 2020. My research takes a computational perspecitve on problems arising from economic contexts. I am also interested in theoretical computer science in general. Services (Selected) I was a PC co-chair of WINE'21 with Michal Feldman (chair) and Inbal Talgam-Cohen (co-chair). I was a workshop co-chair for EC 2019-2021 (first with Scott Kominers and then with Annie Liang). I was a co-editor, with Reshef Meir, for the EC 19 Special Issue of ACM Transaction of Economics and Computation (TEAC). I was the editor-in-chief of the SIGecom exchanges from 2016 to 2019. (Matt Weinberg was a co-editor in 2018-2019.) I was a co-organizer of the First Workshop on Algorithmic Game Theory and Data Science.
