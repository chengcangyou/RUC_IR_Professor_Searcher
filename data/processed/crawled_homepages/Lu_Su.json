I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science, and M.S. in Statistics, both from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, in 2013 and 2012, respectively. I was a member of the Cyber Physical Computing Group led by my Ph.D. advisor, Prof. Tarek F. Abdelzaher. Before starting my Ph.D. study, I received M.E. and B.E. from the School of Computer Science and Technology at Harbin Institute of Technology in China. I have also worked at IBM T. J. Watson Research Center and National Center for Supercomputing Applications. I am a member of ACM and IEEE. Research Interests I am broadly interested in the general areas of Internet of things, cyber-physical systems, mobile computing, wireless and sensor networks, crowd and social sensing systems, big data and cloud computing, security and privacy, data mining and machine learning, and renewable energy.
