Within AMASS, a large EU-ECSEL funded project, she played various roles: technical manager at the global level, work package leader, task leader, and land coordinator. She was also the leader of the dependability-related work packages in the EU-Artemis funded SafeCer and CONCERTO projects. She has been visiting researcher at Scania AB, via the SSF-SM14-0013 grant. She has been member of several program committees related to dependability such as SAFECOMP, ISSRE, EDCC, COMPSAC, LADC, RSSRail, ICSRS, AdaEurope, QUORS, WoSoCER, SASSUR, ReSACI, ISSA, ASCS, DeCPS. She has also been member of program committees related to reuse such as ICSR and VaMoS.She got a M.Sc. in Computer Engineering and a II-level Master in IT, both from Politecnico di Milano (Italy). She got her PhD in Computer Science from the University of Luxembourg (Luxembourg). Barbara Gallina' research interests focus on various aspects of dependable (software) systems engineering and certification. More specifically, she is interested in developing languages, methods, and processes for: 1) modelling, analysis, justification and certification of complex (computer-based) systems, 2) systematic reuse of certification artifacts (product, process, assurance case-related evidence), 3) multi-concern assurance, 4) continuous certification via tool integration, 5) compliance management 6) certification-related evidence engineering (immediate, direct, and indirect) 7) safety culture.
