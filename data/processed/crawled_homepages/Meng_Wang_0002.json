  "content": "About Meng Wang About / Research / Publications / Team / Contact / Old News About Me Dr. Meng Wang is a Professor in the School of Computer Science, with research interests in programming languages and software engineering. He heads the Programming Languages Research Group at Bristol and is a member of IFIP Working Group 2.1 on Algorithmic Languages and Calculi. He is also the lead of Core computer science (programming languages, algorithms and complexity, cryptography, high performance computing, and trustworthy systems) with line management responsibilities for all academics in these areas. Previously, he was a lecturer at University of Kent, and an assistant professor at Chalmers University of Technology. He completed his DPhil (known as PhD elsewhere) at University of Oxford, and before that he studied at National University of Singapore. Research Interest The central theme of his research is to apply theoretical rigour to practical programming, with the aim of improving the correctness and robustness of software systems. In particular, he focuses on designing languages and tools for software development and testing.
