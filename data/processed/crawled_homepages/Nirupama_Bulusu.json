My research program is highly interdisciplinary and collaborative. Please see papers and talks for more details. I currently work on: Block-Supply Chain: A New Anti-Counterfeiting Supply Chain using NFC and Blockchain (see GameSec '18 and CryBlock '18) Infrastructure-based Indoor Positioning Systems (see Percom '19) Networked UAVs (see DroNet '21) Digital City Testbed Center My past work includes: Mobile crowdsourcing applied to environmental sensing and urban planning (e.g. noise pollution mapping) commerce (e.g. monitoring consumer price dispersion) and personalized healthcare and wellness. Trustworthy Mobile Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science Vision: Towards Trustworthy Participatory Sensing Privacy-preserving Crowdsensing with Integrity Guarantees (SecureComm '11) and Secure Tasking and Aggregation Protocol (ACM TECS '14). Applied machine learning for the Internet of Things (IoT) tracking freshwater plumes in the Columbia River Estuary monitoring invasive cane-toad populations in Australia anticipating client movements and forecasting client demand in retail environments and airports. Network localization Distributed Smart Camera Networks (e.g.3D camera network localization) Ultra Low Power Wireless Sensor Networks network optimization data dissemination protocols distributed data compression medium access control data modeling and code consistency maintenance protocols (e.g. DHV, available as part of TinyOS). In the Public Eye In collaboration with the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry, my group created an interactive educational demonstration on sensor networks for elementary school students, which you can read about here.
