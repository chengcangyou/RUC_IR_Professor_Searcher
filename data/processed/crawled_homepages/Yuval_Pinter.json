Feb 2012. Photo by Yuval Pinter (CC-BY-SA 3.0) A Note The people of Israel are still reeling from the horrendous Hamas attack on October 7, 2023. I am no exception. The living hostages are now back, and we are all relieved to see them home, but the healing process is long. I am first and foremost an Israeli. My family and I were not personally harmed but we were all targets. We are still targets. This is a difficult situation to grasp but it is, nevertheless, the truth. If you are an Israeli colleague or student reading this, know that you are not alone in the community. If you are a colleague and expressed your care or support, I want to express my gratitude from here as well. If you're still looking for the words, just say anything and it would be appreciated. We will continue to be strong, steadfast, and resolute. ×¢× ××©×¨×× ××. About I'm Yuval Pinter (×××× ×¤×× ××¨, approximated English pronunciation /yoo-VAHL PIN-ter/), a Senior Lecturer in the Faculty of Computer and Information Science's Institute for Applied AI Research at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU), heading the MeLeL lab working on natural language processing (NLP), and a founding member of BGU's School of Brain sciences and Cognition. Between 2023 and 2025, I was also a Visiting Academic at the Amazon Personalization science team. News: ð£ I gave a keynote at the 2025 (inaugural!) edition of the Tokenization Workshop at Vancouver, co-located with ICML. I also participated in the panel later in the day, where I got the chance to expand on my vision for what the focus of tokenization and token-free research needs to be. The keynote video is here and the panel video is here. News: ð£ I gave a talk at the 2025 edition of the HumanCLAIM workshop at GÃ¶ttingen, slides available upon request. News: ð Our lab's paper, MonoCoder: Domain-Specific Code Language Model for HPC Codes and Tasks, received an outstanding paper award at IEEE HPEC! ð News: ð Our lab's paper, Greed is All You Need: An Evaluation of Tokenizer Inference Methods, received both an outstanding paper award and a senior area chair award at ACL 2024! ð I completed my Computer Science PhD from the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by Prof. Jacob Eisenstein and supported by a Bloomberg Data Science PhD Fellowship. Before moving to the States, I worked as a Research Engineer at Yahoo Labs and as a Computational Linguist at Ginger Software, and before that I got my BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics and my MA in Linguistics at Tel Aviv University as an Adi Lautman Interdisciplinary Program for Outstanding Students scholar. A full-ish CV (from August 2024) is available here. And here is my affiliation color timeline for the 2000s: My interests within NLP are broad. They include lexical semantics, vector representation of text, morphology, interpretability, syntactic parsing, language use in different social settings, user-generated content, machine learning approaches to NLP, application of NLP in information retrieval and code understanding, and more. I am proud to be a member of BGU's Eitan program steering committee, searching for our next generation of interdisciplinarians.

If you want to get my attention for an advisor role, or special consideration in academic matters, it would help to demonstrate a similar mindset and/or some familiarity with the work that I have been doing. In any event, cold emails that contain no information that does not apply to many other faculty members at the faculty are likely to remain unanswered. I am currently not admitting international Master's students.

Research My main area of current research is lexical semantics and subword representations, exploring (a) the challenges presented to text representation techniques by difficult lexical forms; (b) how subword information can be used to create better word representations and vice versa; and (c) how to evaluate algorithms for subword segmentation in an efficient manner.
