My research is in the systems area of data analytics and visualization. Recently, focusing on how to deliver data-intensive analytics and visualization to thin front-ends such as laptop, mobile phone, and Hololens. I am also interested in applied research in data science and visual analytics. My research has been funded by NSF, DOE, DOI/NPS, Intel, and NASA. The following are a few examples of our recent research. Tapestry was first published in 2017 and won best paper award at IEEE LDAV'17. It turns scientific visualization into microservices. From an architectural perspective, Tapestry breaks traditional monolithic pipelines into a novel decoupled pipeline. In result, Tapestry's efficient and transparent use of fine-grained job partitioning, parallelism, and containers, has made it easy to deliver scientific visualization to user-devices as large as the powerwalls and as small as the Hololens and smart phones. In all cases, instantaneously from cloud instances. Furthermore, Tapestry has introduced \"scale of audience\" as a new quality metric for data-intensive scientific visualization for the first time. Tapestry's github.io page contains live demos, explainer video, and github repo. An example of our applied research is the GSM Species Mapper. That work’s data science pipeline starts from Discover Life in America’s ATBI inventory, models species presence in the biodiversity hotspot of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park using HPC resources at University of Tennessee, extracts features and creates overlays, and then makes dynamic visualizations of the interactions between the species and the environment available over the Internet. The analytics of the Species Mapper are used for bio-inventory management, education, and public engagement. That project is in close collaboration with Sarah Lowe at University of Tennessee’s School of Art. Another work of ours started with anonymized records of more than 140,000 past students of University of Tennessee, and led to discoveries of how students actually progress through the university curricula. In many cases, the gaps between the reality and the assumptions made by administrators and faculty are gasping. Those analytics have fundamental implications on advising, student choices, and future curriculum design. For details of the methodology, please refer to our paper “Modeling and Visualizing Student Flow” in IEEE Transactions on Big Data. To see a live demo, please email me. If you are interested in our work on analytics that revealed inverting roles between mainstream media and social media during the last presidential election, please contact Sally McMillan, Courtney Childers, and Stuart Brotman, at University of Tennessee's School of Advertising and Public Relations and School of Journalism and Electronic Media.
