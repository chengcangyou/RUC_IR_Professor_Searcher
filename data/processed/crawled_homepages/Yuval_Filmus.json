After a short period of private tutoring, I embarked on a course of undergraduate study at the Open University of Israel, followed by graduate study at the Weizmann Institute of Science, earning my MSc degree under the supervision of Uri Feige. Six years later, at the behest of Ehud Friedgut, I moved to the University of Toronto, where I completed my PhD under the supervision of Toni Pitassi. After completing a postdoc spent mostly at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, I joined the Computer Science Department at the Technion in 2015, where I am currently an Associate Professor, holding a secondary appointment at the Math Department since 2022. I was lucky to spend several semesters abroad: one at Charles University, and two at the Simons Institute. Additionally, I have made long research trips to KTH, McGill University and TIFR. I am a recipient of the Alon Fellowship and the Krill Prize. Currently I hold grants from the ISF and ERC.
