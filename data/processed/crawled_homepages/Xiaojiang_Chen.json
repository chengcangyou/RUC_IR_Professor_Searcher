Unlike traditional approaches that treat wireless channels as mere data conduits, MetaAI transforms them into active computing elements through programmable metasurfaces, enabling concurrent data transmission and neural network processing. By leveraging the inherent linearity of both wireless propagation and neural networks, our design resolves the fundamental mismatch between sequential wireless transmission and parallel neural computation, while supporting efficient multi-sensor late-stage data fusion. We implemented MetaAI using metasurfaces at both dualband (2.4/5 GHz) and single-band (3.5 GHz) frequencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate robust performance across diverse classification tasks, achieving 82.8% average accuracy (up to 89.8%) even with a simple linear architecture. Multi-sensor fusion further improves accuracy by up to 27.06%. MetaAI represents a fundamental shift in Edge AI architecture, where wireless infrastructure becomes an integral part of the computing pipeline.

[Paper] Hydra: Attacking OFDM-base Communication System via Metasurfaces Generated Frequency Harmonics Yangfan Zhang, Yaxiong Xie, Zhihao Hui, Hao Jia, Xiaojiang Chen Mobicom’24 (CCF-A) While Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) have been shown to enhance OFDM communication performance, this paper unveils a potential security concern arising from widespread RIS deployment. Malicious actors could exploit vulnerabilities to hijack or deploy rogue RIS, transforming them from communication boosters into attackers. We present a novel attack that disrupts the critical orthogonality property of OFDM subcarriers, severely degrading communication performance. This attack is achieved by manipulating the RIS to generate frequency-shifted reflections/harmonics of the original OFDM signal. We also propose algorithms to simultaneously beamform the multiple RIS-generated frequency shifted reflections towards selected targets. Extensive experiments conducted in indoor, outdoor, 3D, and office settings demonstrate that Hydra can achieve a 90% throughput reduction in targeted attack scenarios and a 43% throughput reduction in indiscriminate attack scenarios. Furthermore, we validated the effectiveness of our attacks on both the 802.11 protocol and the 5G NR protocol.

Addressing the limitations ofexisting approaches, which struggle with the diversity ofpesticide compounds, portability issues, and environmentalsensitivity, this paper introduces Hornbill. A wireless andbattery-free electrochemical bio-tag that integrates the advantages of NFC technology with electrochemical biosensorsfor portable, precise, and touchless multi-pesticide detection.The basic idea of Hornbill is comparing the distinct electrochemical responses between a pair of biological receptorsand different pesticides to construct a unique set of featurefingerprints to make multi-pesticide sensing feasible. To incorporate this idea within small NFC tags, we reengineer theelectrochemical sensor, spanning the antenna to the voltageregulator. Additionally, to improve the system’s sensitivityand environmental robustness, we carefully design the electrodes by combining microelectrode technology and materials science. Experiments with 9 different pesticides show thatHornbill achieves a mean accuracy of 93% in different concentration environments and its sensitivity and robustnesssurpass that of commercial electrochemical sensors.

Contact lens-based IOP sensing has garnered significant attention in research. Existing research has been focusing on developing the sensor itself, so the techniques used to read sensing data only support a reading range of several centimeters, becoming the main obstacle for real-world deployment.
