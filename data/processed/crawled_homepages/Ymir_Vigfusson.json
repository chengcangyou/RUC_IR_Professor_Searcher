I have a PhD in Computer Science from Cornell University.​I am a reformed hacker making amends, a mathematician disguised as a computer scientist, a builder of systems and companies, a public speaker and educator, a private pilot and a pianist, a culturally curious Icelander, and an exoskeleton for 4 little viklings. What I SEEK I seek simple solutions to complex problems, such as:How do we make cybersecurity genuine, easy, and understandable?How do we make networked systems effortlessly perform and scale?How do we bolster disease outbreak surveillance with technology? What I HAVE DONE I have been involved in a number of research projects, which are listed in my curriculum vitae and my publications. My academic research has been gratefully supported by the NSF, CDC, RANNIS, and other funding from industry.Before starting Keystrike in 2023 (video on the right), I co-founded the penetration testing company Syndis (acquired in 2021) and the cybersecurity education company Adversary (acquired in 2020). I have had the fortune of spending time with some remarkable people, and I have enjoyed passing what I learned on to my students and various audiences.
