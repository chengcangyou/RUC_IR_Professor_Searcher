L. Pratt Building (6 King's College Road)] PT484D Phone: 416-978-4628 Bio CV Follow @shuishuiblue I direct the FORCOLAB at the University of Toronto. We are focusing on helping distributed and interdisciplinary software teams to collaborate more efficiently and build high-quality software systems, especially in the context of modern open-source collaboration forms, fork-based development, and interdisciplinary teams when building AI-enabled systems or scientific software. We also apply software engineering best practices to facilitate better collaborative Computer-Aided Design (CAD). Please find our publications here. I received my Ph.D.'s degree in May. 2020 from the Institute for Software Research, now called Software and Societal Systems Department (S3D), School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I am very fortunate to worked with my advisor -- Professor Christian KÃ¤stner and unofficial advisor and collaborator Professor Bogdan Vasilescu. I received my Master's degree from Peking University, and my Bachelor's degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University. Prospective Students I am actively looking for talented, motivated colleagues at different levels to join us. See here for detail.

This is intended to be a GitHub bot still under implementation for our [SANER'19] paper with [Preliminary Evaluation on Usefulness]. forks-insight.com This project is designed as a complementary of the GitHub network view. We sift all active forks and summarize changes with statistics and representative keywords. It is a light-weight programming language independent web service for our [ICSE'18] INFOX paper and the [ICSE'18 poster] paper.
