She received her PhD from Carnegie Mellon University in 2003, and studied previously at the University of Edinburgh and Technical University of Darmstadt. Sidebar Menu Home Research Interests Recent Publications Professional Activities Research Interests My research interest lies in developing a theoretical and practical foundation for building and reasoning about reliable safe software systems. To achieve this goal, I combine theoretical research on the logical foundations of computer science in programming languages and verification with system building. The topics I am interested in include logics (classical and non-classical), type theory, theorem proving, logic and functional programming, and logical frameworks. For more information, you can visit Computation and Logic group. Research Opportunities If you are interested in join my group at McGill as an undergraduate researcher, MSc or PhD student, or postdoc, please see the following information. News and Upcoming Events I am on sabbatical and have been awarded a Humboldt Fellowship to visit the MPI-SWS, Germany! I am the PC chair ICFP in 2024 I am co-PC chair for CPP in 2023 and 2024 I am on the PC for POPL'23 I am on the PC for IJCAR'22 I am on the PC for TYPES'22 I am on the PC for CPP'22 I am on the SC of LICS (Logic in Computer Science) I am one of the executive editors of the diamond open-access journal, Logical Methods in Computer Science I gave an invited talk at FSCD'20 I gave an invited tutorial talk at LICS'20 I gave a talk on \"How to give a talk\" at the Logic Mentoring Workshop @ LICS'19 in Vancouver! I gave the keynote at POPL'19 on Mechanizing Metatheory -- The Next Chapter, January 2019 (Video) Test of Time Award @ PPDP'18: B. Pientka and J. Dunfield, Programming with proofs and explicit contexts, published at PPDP'08. For a retrospective, check out my talk a PPDP'18 (slides)! I am the general chair of POPL 2020. I have been awarded a Humboldt Fellowship! Starting September I will be spending the academic year (until August 2018) at the Ludwig-Maximilian University Munich, Germany.
