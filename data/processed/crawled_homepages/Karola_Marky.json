We investigate digital sovereignty, the capacity of individuals (e.g., end-users or developers), institutions (e.g., universities or companies) or states (e.g., administrations or governments) for informational self-determination. My lab contributed substantial research to the fields of two-factor authentication, online & IoT privacy, e-voting, tangible security, and investigated vulnerable groups (e.g., teenagers). My international reputation is substantiated by more than 80 publications including contributions to the research communities of Security & Privacy (e.g., Usenix Security, IEEE S&P, CCS, or PETS), Human-Computer Interaction (e.g., CHI, TOCHI, IMWUT, or DIS), and the intersection thereof (e.g., SOUPS, or BIT). As evidenced by the affiliations of my co-authors, many of my accomplishments resulted from international collaborations with scholars in the UK, Japan, Luxembourg, Switzerland, France, and the Netherlands. Currently, I am a PI of the DFG-funded Cluster of Excellence “CASA”. My further projects include the BMBF-funded project DigiFit Digitale Fitness für Bürgerinnen und Bürger – realistische Risikowahrnehmung, sichere Routinen). I am a member of a number of program committees, such as Usenix Security, CCS, SOUPS, or CHI. Since 2018, I review for international top conferences and journals (e.g., CHI, CSCW, TOCHI, and IMWUT). I have been a member of several organizing committees, such as Voting, MuC, AHs, or Security for XR and XR for Security (VR4Sec). Follow Me I am Karo, a professor at the Ruhr University Bochum specialized in Digital Sovereignty.",
