The first is the application of AI/ML to domains we would typically consider requiring human creativity, which exposes limitations and potential for development of current AI/ML approaches. The second is the application of computational models of creativity to standard AI/ML tasks to improve the performance on these tasks. Note: This website is no longer updated as my lab website for the GRAIL lab at the University of Alberta is under development. For updates until then please check my Google Scholar and Twitter.
