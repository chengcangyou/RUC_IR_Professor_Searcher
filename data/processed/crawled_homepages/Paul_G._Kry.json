I am specifically interested in human and animal motor control (e.g., locomotion, grasping, manipulation) in combination with natural phenomena such as the physics of rigid objects, deformation, and contact. Example application areas include computer animation for video games and movies, training simulations, ergonomics, and biologically inspired robotics and programming by demonstration. An important aspect of my work is the combination of real world measurements, approximate models, and physically based simulation. I am also interested in machine learning, numerical methods, and audio. + Prospective Students International undergraduate internships: If you are interested in an internship, you should directly apply through MITACS Globalink. McGill Undergraduate internships: If you are interested in computer animation research and have sufficiently strong marks then you should contact me with respect to NSERC USRA or SURA early in Winter term. Alternatively, for course credit, I supervise COMP 400 and 396 projects, during any term, on appropriate topics. Prospective MSc students: I am interested in working with strong students with computer graphics-related interests and experience. Ideal candidates should be able to demonstrate prior experience and high-level skill in some combination of computer graphics, vision, machine learning, and numerical simulation. Valid experience includes coursework (including my grad course), hobby projects, or internships on topics related to my research area. Feel free to contact me and include [Prospective MSc] at the start of the subject so that I know you have read this far, but also note that you will probably not receive a reply. My suggestion is you keep your email brief, informative, and to the point if you want to make it likely that I'll read your email. More information about applications and minimum requirements can be found on the department graduate applications page. Prospective PhD students: The easiest path to becoming a PhD student in my lab is to start an MSc and discover an natural aptitude and productivity that warrants converting to PhD. It is also possible to complete an MSc before starting an MSc. Prospective students who wish to apply directly to the PhD program should ideally have a strong MSc in a closely related area from a reputable lab. Other important attributes that strong applicants will have is previous publication in a recognized computer graphics venue, reference letters from top graphics researchers, or work experience in the graphics industry. Feel free to contact me and include [Prospective PhD] at the start of the subject so that I know you have read this far, but also note that you may not receive a reply unless I notice that the information in your email is a particularly good fit. More information about applications and minimum requirements can be found on the department graduate applications page. + Current and Previous Students and Lab Members Current Members Matheus Araujo, PhD Hossam Saeed, PhD (co-supervised with Nowrouzezahrai) Yuanyuan Tao, PhD (co-supervised with Nowrouzezahrai) QM Ton-That, PhD ETS (co-supervised with Andrews) Kaixiang Xie, PhD Loic Nassif, PhD (co-supervised with Andrews) Daniel Kong, PhD (co-supervised with Nowrouzezahrai) Melissa Katz, PhD (co-supervised with Andrews) Avery Straumann, MSc Katia Brenaut, MSc Previous Graduate Students and Post Docs Andreas Enzenhoefer, MSc (co-supervised with Andrews) Alexandre Mercier-Aubin, PhD, now professor at University Sherbrooke Yunhao Luo, MSc (co-supervised with Andrews) Manas Kale, MSc, went to Cloud Imperium Games Kavosh Nakhaie Jazar, MSc, went to Womp Yutong Zhang, MSc, went to Cisco Henry Ho, MSc, went to CMLabs Xinhao Cai, MSc, went to Huawei Canada Lita Fan, MSc all but submitted Emma Goune, MSc Emile Bigot, visiting ENS Paris Nick Dudek, MSc, went to Independent Robotics Mahyar Bayran, MSc, went to Naisense Solutions Eulalie Coevoet, Postdoc, went to University of Naples Robert Belfer, MSc, went to Korbit AI Frank Zhang, MSc Project Adam Bognat, MSc, went to Vantrix Yue Wang, MSc (co-supervised with Nowrouzezahrai), went to Ubisoft Krisztian Birkas, MSc, went to AIRY3D Keren He, MSc project Keno DreÃel, visiting MSc (Copenhagen), became freelance Full Stack Developer / ML Consultant Vincent Petrella, MSc (co-supervised with Langer), went to Ubisoft and then Rockstar Games Tim Olsen, visiting MSc (Copenhagen), went to LEGO Sayantan Datta, MSc (co-supervised with Andrews), became PhD at McGill Benjamin Verdier, MSc, went to Boston University for PhD David Newton, MSc, became Assistant Prof at Nebraska-Lincoln Amir Hossein Rabbani, PhD, went to Ubisoft La Forge Sheldon Andrews, PhD, Postdoc, became Assistant Prof ETS Jian (Ethan) Li, MSc, went to Autodesk Xiaozhong Chen, MSc, went to Ubisoft Brendan Galea, MSc, went to Facebook Ehsan Kia, MSc, went to Google BÃ©nÃ©dicte Leonard-Cannon, MSc (co-supervised with Pineau), went to Microsoft Elias Saad, MSc (co-supervised with Funnell) Pengbo Li, MSc, went to TranscenTEC China Charles Bouchard, MSc, went to GIRO Olivier Remillard, MSc, went to Amazon Timothy Drews, MSc (co-supervised with Verbrugge), went to Google Simon Courtemanche, visiting PhD student, INRIA, went to Embisphere Rami Aladdin, MSc, became CTO SWAG Tech Malaysia Cyrus Rahgoshay, MSc, went to CMLabs then Ubisoft Yasaman Sedaghat, MSc (co-supervised with Funnell), went to Morgan Stanley Victor Cano Becerril, MSc project Clement Mattia, MSc (UJF Grenoble) Ben Sprott, MSc, went to Lumentum Maxime Tournier, visiting PhD student, INRIA, became R&D Engineer at Anatoscope CÃ©cile Picard, visiting PhD student, INRIA Matthieu Nesme, post doctorate, became CTO Anatoscope Previous Undergraduates Henry Lefebvre, USRA undergrad intern Michael Lambiri, undergrad intern Victor Jellab-Zelaya, USRA undergrad intern Ezzeldin Abouelezz, undergrad intern Emma Lee, undergrad intern FranÃ§ois PagÃ©, undergrad intern Emily Shannon, undergrad intern Elliott Kalt, undergrad intern Philippe Gauthier, undergrad intern Denali Relles, SURA intern Alexander Winter, USRA intern Otman Benchekroun, undergraduate intern Yutong Zhang, SURA intern Kejia Ren, Gloablink intern Charles Gingras, USRA intern Paul-Andre Henegar, USRA intern Caroline Zhang,, USRA intern Youri Tamitegama, undergraduate intern Thomas Jansen, undergraduate intern Joao Cardoso, undergraduate intern Franco La Braca, USRA intern Monty Thibault, USRA intern Cornelius Hart, undergraduate intern (co-supervised) Nicholas Aird, undergraduate intern Stefan Tihanyi, undergraduate intern Marc Jarvis, undergraduate intern Galen Voysey, undergraduate intern Thomas Ng, undergraduate intern (co-supervised) Simon Labute, undergraduate intern Gabriel Charette, undergraduate honours project Ben Kirwin, NSERC USRA Alexandre Senecal, undergraduate intern Francis GuÃ©rin, undergraduate intern Matthew Williams, undergraduate honours project Jean-Phillipe April, undergraduate honours project Christopher Harvey, undergraduate intern + Computer Animation and Interaction Capture Lab The l",
