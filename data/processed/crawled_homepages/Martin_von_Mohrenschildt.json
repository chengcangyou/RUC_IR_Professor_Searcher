In practice the input can not be chosen entirely freely but has to satisfy constraints. Many different control strategies have been developed to solve this problem including control strategies for hybrid systems. In situations where optimal operation is at an extremum of the constraint set or the process is nonlinear one single control strategy can not satisfy all objectives over the entire runtime of the system and it is difficult to handle constraints with some control strategies. To overcome these problems we propose a control algorithm that combines several different control strategies into one controller. Vibration Analysis Since about 2004 we research signal processing, especially related to vibration analysis. We are actively engaged with industry in developing new approaches to extract health information and machine characteristics using sensors (e.g. accelerometers) attached to large operating mechanical machinery. Hybrid Systems In engineering mathematics discontinuities appear in many equations. Based on our theory for closed form solutions of differential equations with piecewise coefficients or perturbation, we perform further research on the theoretical and computational aspect of piecewise functions. Immersive Simulation Together with Dr. Shedden from Neuroscience we are investigating the effects of a fully immersive environment (motion simulator) on humans. One goal is to further our understanding about how motion cues are processed and integrated with other information to enhance learning and facilitate transfer of learning outside of the simulator. Motion Simulator Laboratory Please visit the new simulator we page The Motion Simulator Laboratory houses our simulator. The mini-van-sized simulator was modified to contain 3 42'' LCD screens to give a 180 degree field of view. We are installing an eye/head tracker and a EEG system. The synthetic environment is generated by Presagis software, including visualization software, scenario software, AI, and several other components. (The same software as used on CAE commercial flight simulators) The system presents a precision timed, 60Hz, 3D interactive environment to the test subjects. It is controlled by 8 high computers, linked by several networks to ensure low and predictable latency. The simulator offers both driving (using a self coded car simulator) and flying (using the Presagis flight/heli sim packages). The pictures below where taken before the modification, new pictures will follow soon. PRESS Embedded Systems Laboratory The Embedded Systems Laboratory is equipped to study different mechatronics devices (two robots, two XYZ-tables, an industrial conveyor belt) and has a fully equipped electronics workplace (4 channel scope, function generator, two precision multi-meters, a micro controller programmer, e.t.c). Several interesting projects were done over the last years including the hardware and software for an alternative fuel injection controller for a Ford Crown Victoria (V8, 6.8L).

Getting asked what music I like, I added some of my favourite, inspiring songs to a play list of electronic music \"different was good\" most of them have a organ, a Hammond or a Vox Continental, I also like 60's Jazz.
