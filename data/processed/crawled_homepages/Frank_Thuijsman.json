KnowledgeEngineering@Work, KE@Work for short, is a new educational approach in which our very best BSc students in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (previously know as Knowledge Engineering) combine their study fifty/fifty with working on challenging tasks in nearby companies for the full second and third year of their bachelor. This program started in September 2014 and 2 years later we had our first 10 graduates. By now, we have signed 201 study-work contracts with  over 70 local businesses. To see how it developed, read this first lustrum report of January 2019. Shortly before, in November 2018, we were awarded Two Silver Reimagine Education Awards on this project, out of nearly 1200 international applications.Within the research team Games, I mainly focus on (Evolutionary) Dynamic Game Theory, with applications in Economics, Biology and Oncology. Most notably, we organized a Lorenz Workshop Understanding Cancer through Evolutionary Game Theory at the Lorentz Center in Leiden, January 2018.In the summer of 2016 we hosted GAMES 2016, the 5-th World Conference of the Game Theory Society, and EC’16, the 17th ACM Conference on Economics and Computation, that were held simultaneously at Maastricht. The total number of participants was close to 900. These pictures may tell more than words.Over the years, I have been teaching many courses on a wide diversity of topics from Mathematics with an emphasis on the fields of Operations Research and (Dynamic) Game Theory.September 2015 I had a short interview on Alan Turing at local radio L1 (in Dutch; from 12:15 to 12:20 in this fragment).February 2016 the KE@Work program was discussed at Zuid-Limburg.nl (in Dutch).December 2016 an interview on our bachelor program was published in the magazine DecaZine (in Dutch).July 2017 I had a short interview on KE@Work for Dutch national Radio 1, it is fragment 2 at Langs de Lijn.May 2018 the KE@Work program was discussed in Maastricht University newspaper Observant (in Dutch).September 2018, Ionica Smeets wrote a nice column for the Volkskrant based on a talk I gave.January 2019, Gerhard Weiss and me were interviewed on “Solid”, the new project by Tim Berners-Lee to return ownership of data back to the people.March 2019, together with Dieudonnée van de Willige and Mieke Derickx I co-organized the exhibitions Women of Mathematics throughout Europe and Math/Maastricht at Maastricht University.In October 2019, I presented the KE@Work example during a roundtable on Industry Academia Collaboration  at The India-Netherlands Technology Summit 2019.In November 2019 we hosted at DKE a work visit by the Ministry of Economic Affairs on AI and KE@Work.In December 2019 we founded the Mathematics Centre Maastricht (MCM).In August 2020 I was the main speaker for the Summer School on Game Theory, organized by the Dutch Platform for Mathematics, with sessions in Amsterdam and Eindhoven. Please find an impression by two participants here.In April 2021, a team consisting of Katerina Staňková, Ralf Peeters and me, was awarded funding through ‘Science communication by scientists: Appreciated!’ by the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. Read my science communication blog here (in Dutch).In June 2023, the article KE@Work: Studying and Working at the Same Time featured in UMagazine. This online version appeared April 2024. In January 2025, magazine De Ingenieur published a nice interview on our recently started PhD project on using AI in fighting digital crimes. In January 2025, this press message was released on our project to support Burundi University in developing bachelor programs in IT.
