In such settings, the ability to efficiently collect a random sample from the global stream is a powerful primitive, enabling a wide array of downstream tasks such as estimating frequency moments, detecting heavy hitters, or performing sparse recovery. Of particular interest is the task of producing a perfect $L_p$ sample, which given a frequency vector $f \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, outputs an index $i$ with probability $\\frac{f_i^p}{\\|f\\|_p^p}+\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{poly}(n)}$. In this paper, we resolve the problem of perfect $L_p$ sampling for all $p\\ge 2$ in the distributed monitoring model. Specifically, our algorithm runs in $k^{p-1} \\cdot \\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ bits of communication, which is optimal up to polylogarithmic factors. Utilizing our perfect $L_p$ sampler, we achieve adversarially-robust distributed monitoring protocols for the $F_p$ moment estimation problem, where the goal is to provide a $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation to $f_1^p+\\ldots+f_n^p$. Our algorithm uses $\\frac{k^{p-1}}{\\varepsilon^2}\\cdot\\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ bits of communication and achieves optimal bounds up to polylogarithmic factors, matching long-standing lower bounds by Woodruff and Zhang (STOC 2012). Crucially, we use our perfect $L_p$ sampler in conjunction with a novel bivariate Taylor series expansion to construct a difference estimator, which approximates the growth of a function between two different times and may be of independent interest. Finally, we apply our framework to achieve near-optimal adversarially robust distributed protocols for central problems such as counting, frequency estimation, heavy-hitters, and distinct element estimation. Online Learning with Limited Information in the Sliding Window Model --vladimirbraverman--, --sumeghagarg--, --chenwang--, --davidwoodruff--, Samson Zhou SODA 2026 [abstract] Motivated by recent work on the experts problem in the streaming model, we consider the experts problem in the sliding window model. The sliding window model is a well-studied model that captures applications such as traffic monitoring, epidemic tracking, and automated trading, where recent information is more valuable than older data. Formally, we have $n$ experts, $T$ days, the ability to query the predictions of $q$ experts on each day, a limited amount of memory, and should achieve the optimal regret $\\sqrt{W}\\text{polylog}(nT)$ regret over a window of the last $W$ days at any time. While it is impossible to achieve such regret with $1$ query, we show that with $2$ queries we can achieve such regret and with only $\\text{polylog}(nT)$ bits of memory. Not only are our algorithms optimal for sliding windows, but we also show for every interval $\\mathcal{I}$ of days that we achieve $\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{I}|}\\text{polylog}(nT)$ regret with $2$ queries and only $\\text{polylog}(nT)$ bits of memory, providing an exponential improvement on the memory of previous interval regret algorithms. Building upon these techniques, we address the bandit problem in data streams, where $q=1$, achieving $n T^{2/3}\\text{polylog}(T)$ regret with $\\text{polylog}(nT)$ memory, which is the first sublinear regret in the streaming model in the bandit setting with polylogarithmic memory; this can be further improved to the optimal $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T n})$ regret if the best expert's losses are in a random order. Perfect Lp Sampling with Polylogarithmic Update Time --williamswartworth--, --davidwoodruff--, Samson Zhou FOCS 2025 [abstract] Perfect $L_p$ sampling in a stream was introduced by Jayaram and Woodruff (FOCS, 2018) as a streaming primitive which, given turnstile updates to a vector $x \\in \\{-\\poly(n), \\ldots, \\poly(n)\\}^n$, outputs an index $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$ such that the probability of returning index $i$ is exactly \\[\\frac{|x_i|^p}{\\|x\\|_p^p} \\pm \\frac{1}{n^C},\\] where $C > 0$ is an arbitrarily large constant. They achieve the optimal $\\tilde{O}(\\log^2 n)$ bits of memory for $0 < p < 2$. An important question left open by that work is to improve the time needed to process each new stream update, which is at least $n^C$ on every single update. For $0 < p < 2$, we give the first perfect $L_p$-sampler with the same optimal amount of memory but with only $\\poly(\\log n)$ update time. Crucial to our result is an efficient simulation of a sum of reciprocals of powers of truncated exponential random variables by approximating its characteristic function, using the Gil-Paelez inversion formula, and applying variants of the trapezoid formula to quickly approximate it.
