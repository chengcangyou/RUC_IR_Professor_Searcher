I am heading the Games Engineering research group and we are part of the Chair for Human-Computer Interaction. Together, we are mainly responsible for the Games Engineering program of studies. Until the end of 2016, I was a postdoc at the Chair of Organic Computing at the University of Augsburg, where I also did my habilitation. Before that, until 2012, I did a postdoc with the LINDSAY project at the University of Calgary. As part of the Evolutionary and Swarm Design research group, I received my PhD also at the University of Calgary in 2009. I moved there in 2006, right after I had finished my Diploma degree in Informatics at the University of Erlangen-Nürnberg. My research interests are:Real-Time Interactive Systems (Visual Programming, Immersion, Software Engineering)Interactive Simulations (Serious Games, Simulations in Health, Logistics, Construction,…) Artificial Life (Self-Organisation, Adaptive Systems, Evolution)Artificial Intelligence(Agent-Based Modeling, Procedural Content Generation) Teaching Seminar - Current Trends in Games Engineering Visit Wuestudy Sync Space Visit Wuestudy Interactive Storytelling and Playable Narratives Visit Wuestudy Game Lab 3.1 Visit Wuestudy Game Lab 2.1 Visit Wuestudy Asset Development - Modelling & Animation Visit Wuestudy Publications Follow our Social Media Channels Contact Lehrstuhl für Mensch-Computer-Interaktion Universität Würzburg Emil-Fischer-Straße 50 97074 Würzburg How to Find Us University Main Page About the University University Contact Legal Information",
