My main research interest is the application of graph theory in various areas of computer science and engineering. These areas include computer networks, algorithm design, and fault-tolerant computing. My usual practice has been to start with an open problem in these areas and to figure out a graph-theoretic approach for its solution. Many problems have been solved this way, and many are awaiting talented and hard-working graduate students. Computer Science and Engineering 428 S.
