I am an ACM Senior Member (top 25% of ACM), and I am a recipient of the NSF CAREER award. I direct the Societal Computing Lab (SoCo Lab). I'm the Director of Graduate Studies for Data Science, and I'm also the Co-Director of the Animal Informatics MS and PhD track and the BS Cognate, BS Minor, and PhD Minor in Animal-Computer Interaction. I'm a core faculty of the Health Informatics PhD track. My research focuses on how to better support health and wellbeing, specifically that of underserved and vulnerable populations, through the design, development, and evaluation of sociotechnical systems and community-based mechanisms. I also design technologies to amplify human and animal capabilities in animal-assisted interventions, improve animal welfare, and cultivate empathy for others. Prior to joining IUB, I was a Research Associate and Lecturer in the College of Information Sciences and Technology at Penn State. I received my Ph.D. in Information and Computer Science from UC Irvine, where I was a Chancellor's Fellow, M.S. in Information Networking from Carnegie Mellon University, and B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from UCLA. I have also worked at Microsoft Research and IBM Research. My CV: Funding Support Publications Journal Papers Cristina Bosco, Fereshtehossadat Shojaei, Alec A.
