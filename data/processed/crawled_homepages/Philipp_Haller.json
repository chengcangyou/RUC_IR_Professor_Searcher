PhD EPFL, 2010. My main research interests are in the design and implementation of programming languages, type systems, concurrency, and distributed programming. In June 2019 I received, together with 8 other individuals, the 2019 ACM SIGPLAN Programming Languages Software Award for the development of the Scala language. (Press: EPFL, CMU, KTH CASTOR Center) Previously, I was a researcher, software engineer, and consultant at Typesafe Inc. Prior to Typesafe, I was a post-doctoral fellow at Stanford in the Pervasive Parallelism Lab (PPL) and at EPFL in the Programming Methods Lab (LAMP). Prior to that I was a PhD student of Martin Odersky at EPFL. I am a top-10 contributor of the Scala project. I am co-author (with Jason Zaugg, Lightbend) of Scala's async/await extension (SIP-22) for asynchronous programming, and one of the lead designers of Scala's futures library (SIP-14). I created Scala's first widely-used actor library, and am the main author of the book \"Actors in Scala\" (Artima, 2012).

June 2017 -- I received the 2016 Teacher of the Year award of the School of Computer Science and Communication (now EECS) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, for Software Development Academy, the bootcamp education for newly arrived immigrants which I created together with Mattias Wiggberg (KTH) and Farzad Golchin (Novare Potential). November 2016 -- The CFP for PLACES 2017 was published. Please consider submitting a paper. PLACES 2017 is co-located with ETAPS 2017 in Uppsala, Sweden. November 2016 -- I am going to give a talk on Thursday December 1st at the 10th Annual Multicore Day 2016 which is part of the SICS Software Week 2016. Topic: Safe and Scalable Concurrent Programming in Scala. September 2016 -- Our paper Reactive Async: Expressive Deterministic Concurrency (with Simon Geries, Michael Eichberg, and Guido Salvaneschi) has been accepted to the Scala Symposium 2016. August 2016 -- My paper LaCasa: Lightweight Affinity and Object Capabilities in Scala with Alex Loiko has been accepted to OOPSLA 2016. June 2016 -- I will attend a Dagstuhl Seminar on Theory and Applications of Behavioural Types to be held at Schloss Dagstuhl in Germany. June 2016 -- I was interviewed by 47 Degrees at Scala Days Berlin 2016 on deterministic concurrency and the future of Scala (video on YouTube). June 2016 -- Our pilot project on an intensive programming education for new arrivals to Sweden has received funding from the Wallenberg Foundations (KTH news, ComputerSweden). May 2016 -- Our paper Function Passing: A Model for Typed, Distributed Functional Programming (with Heather Miller, Normen Müller, and Jocelyn Boullier) has been accepted to Onward! 2016. April 2016 -- I will attend a Dagstuhl Seminar on Programming Language Techniques for Incremental and Reactive Computing to be held at Schloss Dagstuhl in Germany. Publications Book Actors in Scala, by Philipp Haller and Frank Sommers. Walnut Creek, California. Artima Inc, 2012. Actors in Scala is the authoritative guide to programming with the actors framework of Scala's standard library, co-written by the creator and lead maintainer, Philipp Haller. The book provides a comprehensive introduction to the actor model of concurrency and shows how Scala's actors enable you to build efficient, scalable, and robust concurrent software for the JVM.
