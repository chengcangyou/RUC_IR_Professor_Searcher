I am particularly interested in topics at the intersection of machine learning and security. Three research directions include: (1) Attacks using ML: Investigating how recent developments in ML can be misused for harm. (2) Attacks on ML systems: Understanding vulnerabilities of ML systems and improving robustness. (3) ML for better security/privacy: Leveraging advances in ML to build robust defenses. I am a recipient of the Distinguished Paper Award (SOUPS 2014), Best Paper Award (COSN 2015), and the AI2000 Most Influential Scholar Award Honorable Mention for being among the top 100 most cited scholars in computer networking from 2009-2019. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems. Before joining VT, I spent ~2 years as a Postdoc in SAND lab (at UCSB). Prior to that, I spent a year as a Researcher at Nokia Bell Labs, Stuttgart. Our research is supported by CCI, NSF and 4-VA. Latest Updates August 2025: I am on sabbatical this coming term. If you are looking for speakers, feel free to reach out. August 2025: New NSF SaTC Medium funding to address data challenges in ML-based security tasks using Generative AI. July 2025: Promoted to Associate Professor with Tenure. January 2025: Our NeuralCleanse work (IEEE S&P’19) is listed among the Normalized Top-100 Security Papers and also the Top-100 Security papers from 1980 to 2025. August 2023: Invited to participate in the AI Technology Initiative organized by the Bipartisan Virginia Technology and Innovation Caucus. This initiative is to “explore opportunities, risks, and impacts associated with Artificial lntelligence (AI) and technology use in government processes and decision-making.” July 2023: Our work on deepfake text detection (IEEE S&P'23 paper) was featured in a CACM article by Neil Savage. February 2023: New NSF SaTC funding to study security of open-domain chatbots. November 2022: New TechXpore article about our upcoming IEEE S&P'23 paper.
