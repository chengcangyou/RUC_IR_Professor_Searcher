Mooney Professor of Computer Science, The University of Texas at Austin Director of the UT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory B.S. in Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign, 1983 M.S. in Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign, 1985 Ph.D. in Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign, 1988 Research Teaching Personal Contact Note to Grad-Student Applicants Research Interests and Publications As a member of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory I lead the Machine Learning Research Group which has explored a variety of areas, but my current focus is on natural language processing / computational linguistics. Recent Publications: Here are my publications for 2025. 2024. 2023. 2022. and 2021. Research Areas (click on an area for related publications): Natural Language Learning: Learning for syntactic and semantic parsing, lexicon acquisition, information extraction, language generation, machine translation, and word sense disambiguation. Connecting Language and Perception: Grounding natural language understanding in computer vision and robotics. Natural Language for Software Engineering: Using NLP to help software development by generating code from language or generating NL comments from code. Explainable AI: AI systems that can explain their reasoning to their human users. Statistical Relational Learning : Learning methods that combine the strengths of predicate logic and probability. Information Extraction: Identifying specific pieces of structured data in web pages or natural-language documents. Transfer Learning : Using previously acquired knowledge to aid learning on new related problems. Active Learning : Automated selection of good training examples for supervised or semi-supervised learning. Abductive Reasoning : Producing the best explanation for observed evidence using both logical and probabilistic reasoning. Text Categorization and Clustering : Supervised and unsupervised classification of documents and web pages. Text Data Mining: Discovering knowledge from text using information extraction and rule induction. Record Linkage & Duplicate Detection : Identifying textually similar but distinct database records that refer to the same entity. Bioinformatics : Learning to extract knowledge from biomedical literature. Semi-Supervised Learning : Learning from a mixture of labeled and unlabeled data. Ensemble Learning : Learning effective committees of hypotheses. Learning for Recommender Systems: Content-based and collaborative recommending. Inductive Logic Programming: Learning Prolog programs (rules in first-order predicate logic) from examples. Neuro-Symbolic Learning: Comparing and combining neural and symbolic learning methods. Knowledge-Base and Theory Refinement: Automatically modifying rule bases and Bayesian networks to fit empirical data.

Current Research Group Meetings: NLL: Natural Language Learning CLAMP: Connecting Language and Perception NL4SE: Natural Language for Software Engineering Additional Affiliations: I am also a member of the UT Computational Linguistics Lab. I am also affiliated with the UT Department of Statistics and Data Science. I am also affiliated with the UT Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics. I was President of the International Machine Learning Society from 2008-2011. I was program co-chair (with Yolanda Gil) of the Twenty-First National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-06) in Boston, July 16-20, 2006. I was general chair of the joint Human Language Technology Conference / Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing Conference for 2005 (HLT/EMNLP-05). I was elected a Fellow of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) in 2005 \"For significant contributions to machine learning, particularly explanation-based learning, theory refinement, and learning for natural-language processing.\" I was elected a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in 2010 \"For contributions to machine learning and natural language processing.\" I was elected a Fellow of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) in 2014 \"For significant contributions to machine learning for semantic parsing, language generation, and multimodal integration.\" Vita: See my complete vita (in PDF).

See a scanned version of a paper I wrote (on a typewriter!) for a high-school English class when I was only 17 years old entitled \"High-level Artificial Intelligence: An Imminent Possibility with an Enormous Potential for Good\". My enthusiasm for AI started early and has not waned; however, my expections about AI's rate of progress and its positive social implications have matured and (hopefully) become more realistic. In the fall of 1979, I went to the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana to obtain all of the degrees listed above. In December 1987, I completed my Ph.D. thesis under the direction of Prof. Gerald DeJong and then began as a faculty member here in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin. See more information on my academic genealogy, which traces my professorial lineage back through Danish Linguists to German Theologians.

Note to Potential Grad-Student and Internship Applicants Unfortunately, I am unable to personally respond to email requests regarding application to our graduate program or other solicitations for positions in my research lab. I encourage potential graduate-student applicants to see the department information on applying to our graduate program. I am no longer recruiting new Ph.D. students. I am afraid I currently have no funding or capacity to advise summer internships. mooney@cs.utexas.edu",
