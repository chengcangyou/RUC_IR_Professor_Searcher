My research field is human-robot interaction. I am particularly interested in the following topics: joint activities between humans and robots; human-robot teamwork and collaboration, in particular with respect to interaction fluency; robotic personal companions; non-anthropomorphic robot design; computational models for embodied cognition in robots, in particular with respect to artificial practice; anticipation and timing in HRI and multi-agent MDPs; entertainment, theater, and musical performance robots; robot improvisation; nonverbal communication in HRI; and embodiment in HCI. New article on IEEE Spectrum: What We Can Learn from Social Robots That Didn't Make It? Two awards at HRI 2019. Best Full Paper and 3rd Prize for Poster Session! Lots of new press on our recently published study on how competing with robots affects humans. Astonishingly, mine was the #9 most popular TED talk of 2014. The video talk below gives a nice overview of some of my research.And this interview accurately reflects some of my societal thoughts on human-robot interaction.",
