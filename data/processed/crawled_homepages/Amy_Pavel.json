Before joining UC Berkeley, I spent three wonderful years (Spring 2022-Spring 2025) as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin. I was previously a postdoc at Carnegie Mellon University, a Research Scientist at Apple, and I received my PhD from UC Berkeley EECS. I regularly teach a Computer Science class that covers the design and development of user interfaces (Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction). Prior versions include CS160 at UC Berkeley in 2018 and CS378 at UT Austin in 2022.Current UC Berkeley Students: I am actively recruiting UC Berkeley students for research positions in my lab! Check out this document (CalNet ) to learn more and apply.Prospective Students, Visitors, Interns, and Postdocs: I recruit PhD students every year. Please apply directly to the UC Berkeley EECS PhD program and list me as a potential advisor.

Using my systems, remote content creators more effectively collaborate, video authors efficiently create accessible descriptions for blind users, and instructors help students to learn and retain key points. To inform future systems that capture what is important to domain experts and people with disabilities, I also conduct and collaborate on in-depth qualitative (e.g., AAC communication, memes) and quantitative studies (e.g., 360Â° Video, VR Saliency). My research goal is to make communication effective and accessible.PreprintsVid2Coach: Transforming How-To Videos into Task AssistantsMina Huh, Zihui Xue, Ujjaini Das, Kumar Ashutosh, Kristen Grauman, Amy PavelTo Appear at UIST 2025Project Page | arXivMorae: Proactively Pausing UI Agents for User ChoicesYi-Hao Peng, Dingzeyu Li, Jeffrey P.
