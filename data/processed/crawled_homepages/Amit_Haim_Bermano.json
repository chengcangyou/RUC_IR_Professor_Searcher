Education Computer graphics, additive manufacturing, geometry processing, augmented reality, machine learning Email: amberman@tauex.tau.ac.ilMy CRIS profileWebsiteLinkedInOffice: Schreiber, 323 Senior Lecturer - The Blavatnik School of Computer Science. My research focuses on geometry processing and how it can benefit other fields, ranging from computer graphics and vision, to computational fabrication and medical imaging. In other words, I have studied both problems in the geometry processing realm and how to adapt the clean theoretical techniques it offers to real life problems. More specifically, I am currently (or have been) exploring the merits of geometry processing in the contexts of: 3D printing and computational fabrication Animation and deformation Machine learning Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality Medical imaging Education B.Sc. in Computer Science, The Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, 2008 M.Sc. in Computer Science, The Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, 2011 Dr.Sc. in Computer Science, ETH Zürich, 2015 Computer graphics, additive manufacturing, geometry processing, augmented reality, machine learning Senior Lecturer (assistant professor), School of Computer Science, Tel-Aviv University, 2018 Faculty of Exact SciencesAbout the FacultyMessage from the Dean Chairs Institutes, Endowments & Prizes Awards & Prizes Rector's List & Dean's List In Memoriam Events & Conferences News Contact and Visitor Information Staff & AdministrationFaculty Council Faculty Committees Faculty Administration & Student Secretariat Excellence in Teaching ResearchSchool of Chemistry School of Computer Science and AI School of the Environment and Earth Sciences School of Mathematical Science School of Physics & Astronomy Researchers in the Faculty StudentsUrgent Messages (Hebrew) General Messages (Hebrew) Course Catalog (Hebrew) Catalog for previous years (Hebrew) Exams Timetable (Hebrew) Timetable & Schedules (Hebrew) Course Registration - Bidding (Hebrew) Scholarships (Hebrew) New Students (Hebrew) Forms to Committees (Hebrew) FAQ Academic UnitsSchool of Chemistry School of Computer Science and AI School of the Environment and Earth Sciences School of Mathematical Sciences School of Physics & Astronomy About TAUAcademic Units Campus Map Transport & Parking Emergency Contacts Phone Directory Dean of Students Sexual Harassment Prevention Student Union Computer Services Academic Calendar Libraries Accessibility Statement Terms of Use Privacy and Data Protection TAU InternationalTAU International website About Graduate Programs Undergrad Programs Language Programs Summer Programs Study Abroad SupportersGlobal TAU Magazine Friends Associations Board of Governors TAU Alumni Development & Public Affairs Print Publications Accessibility Facebook Instagram Linkedin Youtube Coursera Spotify Tel Aviv University makes every effort to respect copyright.
