I am Professor at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and lead the SYmmetric cryptography and machine Learning Lab (SyLLab) since April 2012. I recently co-founded the start-up TT-logic.ai. Previously, I was a PhD student at Orange Labs (former France Télécom R&D) and University of Versailles under the supervision of Henri Gilbert and Marc Girault. I also worked two years at Ingenico as Cryptography Expert, and at Nanyang Technological University as Research Fellow. My main research topic is the design and the cryptanalysis of symmetric cryptography primitives, as well as applications of machine learning to security. News [Mar. 25] The article “Super-Sbox Cryptanalysis: Improved Attacks for AES-like Permutations” from FSE 2010 has received the Test of Time Award at FSE 2025 [Feb. 23] The article “Mind Your Path: on (Key) Dependencies in Differential Characteristics” has obtained the Best Paper Award at FSE 2023/ ToSC [Nov. 22] Extremely honored to be one of the recipients of a NRF Investigatorship award (Topic: “Interpretable and Automated Cryptanalysis for Tailor-Made Cryptographic Design”). Postdoc/PhD candidates interested to work on cryptography/automated solvers/machine learning, please drop me an email.
