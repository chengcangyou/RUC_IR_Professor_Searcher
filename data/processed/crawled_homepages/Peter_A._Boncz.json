Before, I served in the CWI management team (from 2017 on), where I was responsible for the Machine Learning, Database Architectures and Human-centered Data Analytics research groups. Professor at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the special chair of Large-Scale Analytical Data Management (about my research). Architect of the database systems MonetDB, VectorWise (aka Actian Vector) and VectorH (VectorWise-on-Hadoop). Have been involved in 6 spin-off or startup companies in the area of data management. has my online CV Hiring: I tend to have PhD and post-doc positions open for cutting-edge research in the topics outlined below. Approach me (email boncz at cwi dot nl) to apply. Teaching: For Amsterdam Data Science I have been developing new education in Big Data technologies, teaching the architectural principles of frameworks like Spark, and how to use such systems to analyze large datasets on clusters in the cloud (together with Hannes Muehleisen): while on sabbatical at MotherDuck (2022-2024), I gave a guest lecture in the Data Preparation MSc course at University of Amsterdam on ..MotherDuck and one in the BSc Databases course to give A Taste of Database Architecture. the Large Scale Data Engineering MSc course at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (yearly, runs Sept-Oct). the Big Data Infrastructures and Technology module in the Business Analytics and Data Science post-graduate course at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (yearly, Sept-Oct - until 2020). the Big Data course in the Data Science MSc at University of Amsterdam (yearly, Feb-Apr -- until 2019). in the ScaDS summer school on Big Data, I also gave a lecture on Benchmarking Graph Data Management Systems (July 2016). in the EDBT 2015 summer school, which focused on graph data management, I taught a mini-course on Benchmarking Graph Data Management Systems (Sept 2015). Prior to this, I used to teach the Databases bachelor course at VU, and even earlier the Database II course at UvA. Publications: [dblp] [scholar] [ResearchGate] Awards: VLDB Best Artifact Award (2025), for the open-source package of ALP floating-point compression https://github.com/cwida/ALP. DaMoN Best Paper Award (2025), for the paper Bang for the Buck: Vector Search on Cloud CPUs. The first ever CIDR Test-Of-Time (2024) which introduced the concept of Vectorized Query Execution which is now broadly adopted in database systems. Humboldt Research Award (2013) from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation. Consequently I spent 0.4FTE of the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 academic years at TU Munich. The TU Munich Institute for Advanced Study (TUM-IAS) has named me Honorary Hans Fisher Fellow, in light of my stay at TU Munich during the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 academic years. VLDB Ten Year Best Paper Award (2009), for the paper Database architecture optimized for the new bottleneck: Memory access. See the VLDB Keynote. DaMoN Best Paper Award (2008), for the paper DSM vs. NSM: CPU Performance Tradeoffs in Block-Oriented Query Processing. DaMoN Best Paper Award (2007), for the paper Vectorized Data Processing on the Cell Broadband Engine. ICT Regie Award (2006) for my role in the CWI spin-off company Data Distilleries. Industry Work: MotherDuck (2022-). I have been spending sabbatical time at MotherDuck, a startup co-founded by DuckDB Labs, which has the goal of putting DuckDB in the cloud for analysis applications. It does so with a twist: it exploits the fact that DuckDB is always present on the client, even if that client is a web-browser (through DuckDB-WASM, in that case); so cloud and client can work together. This allows for very low-latency queries on local data (see my HPTS2024 presentation 60 frames per second cloud databases), as well as to reduce cloud compute cost by doing more work on clients. See also the MotherDuck Lecture and the CIDR2024 Hybrid Query Execution presentation. DuckDB Labs (2021-). DuckDB pays a debt generated for years by the database research community: providing a quality (usable and competent) analytical and portable database system in open source. DuckDB Labs is not my spin-off: it was founded by original DuckDB creators Hannes Muehleisen and Mark Raasveldt, with me this time playing the role of technical and business advisor. The mission of DuckDB Labs is to enable a core team to maximize the impact of DuckDB, starting in data science but extending into cloud warehousing, in-browser analytics, secure and private analytics, mobile and edge analytics, as well as hardware-embedded uses, such as smart storage (and use cases we did not think of yet). Try the [DuckDB] system. Databricks (2016-). I shortly hosted the Vectorwise team in Amsterdam at CWI, looking for a new home, that end of 2016 became the Databricks Amsterdam office. I have worked as advisor at Databricks Amsterdam since then, focusing on further talent development and acquisition to grow the office, as well as providing technical advise to the local team, which has worked on projects such as Delta Lake, the Photon vectorized query processing engine as well as BI workloads in Databricks. Celerata AG (2015-2016). As TUM Fellow and member of the database research group of TU Munich, I advised, helped and co-founded a small company around the HyPer JIT-compiling database system by Thomas Neumann. Within a year, this company was bought by Tableau, and the HyPer technology is part of each Tableau software installation, with Celerata morphing in the Munich R&D center of Tableau. With the acquisition of Tableau by Salesforce, it is exciting to see Hyper going into new services and workloads. Try the [Hyper API] system. Vectorwise (2008-2010). In its time, the fastest-per-core analytical database system on earth, developed at CWI in the MonetDB/X100 project with Marcin Zukowski, Sandor Heman and Niels Nes. The company was funded and bought by Actian (the company that also sells the Ingres database). Try the [Actian Vector] system. MonetDB BV (2008-2021). A holding company, directed by Martin Kersten, that holds the IP on open-source MonetDB users, participates in EU projects, and services commercial users via its MonetDB Solutions BV daughter. Since 2020 MonetDB BV has its own office, outside (but near) CWI. Try the [MonetDB] system. Data Distilleries (1996-2002). Though technically not a co-founder, it was very close. My PhD topic MonetDB was the backend in the Data Distilleries Architecture, and I was responsible for its integration and also for research. Later I became chief architect; a role shared with Tim Ruhl, where we were responsible for the development of the entire product line. Data Distilleries grew to 100 people, but retreated to Europe when its aggressive US expansion ran aground in the 9-11 aftermath. In Europe it remained reasonably successful and had an average headcount for 40 over all of its existence. In 2003 it was acquired by SPSS, who two years later moved development to the US. Part of it still survive in what is now IBM's SPSS Modeler and Deployment products. Noteworthy: The management team of CWI in summer 2024 decided to award the Dijkstra Fellowship to Marchin Zukowski. Marcin was my first PhD student and was instrumental in bringing vectorized query execution to fruitition during his PhD, for leading the Vectorwise CWI spin-off company, that proved the value of this technique in practice, and subsequently went on to become one of the three co-founders of Snowflake, co-creating the first analytical database service architected for the cloud, and where he led the engineering team in many of the first years. I am very proud of him! Gave a SIGMOD2024 keynote on \"Making Data Management Better (with vectorized execution)\". I hope it inspires researchers to look beyond just publishing more papers, but do research with impact, that makes data management better for others. Due to COVID, my keynote talk at AMW 2020 in Cusco, Peru was postponed, but I eventually delivered at AMW2023 in Santiago de Chile: SQL/PGQ: a systems perspective (Google slides with speaker notes) In Memoriam the unforgettable Martin Kersten, my mentor (1953-2022). Presented the Past, Present and Future of the Database Architectures research group at CWI at the SIKS 2022 day - an in-person event again!. keynote at EDBT2022 on The (sorry) State of Graph Database Systems. For the Dutch Health Ministry, I weas a member of the commission Digital Support for Combating COVID-19. One of the activities is overseeing the development and deployment of the Dutch CoronaMelder app (June 2020-February 2022). Proud of my first PhD student Marcin Zukowski who co-founded Snowflake, that built the first cloud-native data warehouse. Which of course thanks some of its speed to compressed columnar storage and vectorized execution. Proud to have drawn Databricks to Amsterdam, where they announced to be investing 100 million euros. Keynote on fine-grained co-clustering of data (BDCC) given at the HardBD International Workshop on Big Data Management on Emerging Hardware (co-located with ICDE 2018, Paris). October 17 2014 I held my Inaugural Lecture at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, where I became professor in the special chair of Large-Scale Analytical Data Management. Thomas Neumann and I started a blog for database architects. The idea is to publish news announcements about the database systems that the bloggers are involved with (HyPer, MonetDB, Vectorwise...), technical articles that are not really suited as scientific publications but still interesting, or teasers for papers or talks.
