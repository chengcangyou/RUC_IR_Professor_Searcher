During 2013 to 2016, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Quantum Computing and the Department of Combinatorics and Optimization at the University of Waterloo. I completed my PhD in 2013 in Computer Science and Engineering at the Pennsylvania State University, under the supervision of Sean Hallgren. Prior to that, I received my bachelor’s degree from University of Science & Technology of China in 2008. My research interests lie in cryptography, especially provable-security in the presence of quantum attacks, quantum algorithms, computational complexity and theoretical computer science broadly. I’m grateful to the National Science Foundation (including a Career Award) and the SONY Group for funding my research. [CV] News <2025-07-15> Chuhan Lu successfully defended her Ph.D. dissertation.
