My research lies at the intersection of high-performance computing (HPC) and Data visualization. More broadly, I work on problems in parallel I/O, big data processing, scalable algorithms, scientific visualiaztion, GPUs & performance modeling. I completed my Ph.D. in Computing at the SCI Institute at the University of Utah, advised by Valerio Pascucci. As an undergraduate at DAIICT, I was fascinated by computer graphics, ultimately leading me to join The University of Utah. While at the U, I spent a summer at Argonne National Lab, where I was exposed to the world of supercomputing. I was thrilled by the idea of using supercomputers to solve computationally massive problems. Ever since, I have worked at the intersection of HPC, analytics and visualization, helping domain scientists extract knowledge from massive amounts of complex data.

Research Projects Data management at exascale The project aims to develop a scalable and extensible I/O runtime and tools for the next-generation adaptive data layouts that inherently imbibe compression and progressive data access, advancing the state of art in the field of high-performance data management. The work will lay the foundation for end-to-end data management solutions catering to the challenging needs of the simulation-analysis pipeline, accelerating science at exascale. ISC IPDPS ICPP HiPC MPI, Collectives Enabling effective data transfer among components, such as memory to CPU, between cores, and from CPU to GPU, is crucial for achieving optimal performance in exascale systems. MPI Collectives that require simultaneous data exchanges among all processes imposes additional strain on these systems. The project aims to tackle this challenge by developing novel algorithms to improve the performance of collective functions. As an example, we are exploring low-level application-agnostic algorithmic innovations to generalize the logarithmic time Bruck algorithm to support non-uniform all-to-all workloads. HPDC ISC HPDC HPC Asia EduHiPC GPU accelerated visualiaztion for the WEB The project aims to provide a software stack for interactive web-based scientific data visualization and analysis leveraging the computational capabilities of GPUs and data streaming. We are developing the building blocks necessary to advance analysis and visualization-specific applications, and also introduce necessary algorithmic innovations to overcome the limitations of constrained environments like web browsers. In particular, we are leveraging WebGPU to enable low-level control over the GPU. Pacific Vis TVCG LDAV EGPGV 2022 EGPGV 2018 Declarative analysis at Scale The project investigates full-stack implementation methodologies for expressive programming systems that effectively bridge the gap between human-level specification and high-performance implementation of complex reasoning tasks at scale. Declarative languages permit a programmer to provide high-level rules and declarations that define some sought-after solution as a latent implication to be materialized automatically by the computer. The project aims to scale this vision of high-performance declarative reasoning both to structured, higher-order, formulations and to next generation of supercomputers. AAAI VLDB ICS ISC USENIX HiPC CC Topology driven analytics The project aims to unify the study of mental illness across sites (and locations) by developing a topology driven analysis (TDA) cyberinfrastructure for weighted brain networks (FCNs). Topological data analysis (TDA) can extract the underlying shape (pattern) from a network, that can be used the then used in a statistical inferencing workflow to compare and classify brain networks effectively. The topology-based analysis and visualization framework will not only enable the study of fMRI data but will also make it possible to have a centralized curation of datasets.
