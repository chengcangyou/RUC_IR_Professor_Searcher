He received his M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from Linköping University in 2000, and his doctoral degree from Mälardalen University in 2007 with the thesis entitled \"Event Pattern Detection for Embedded Systems\".Jans current research focuses on model-based software and systems development, addressing areas such as artifact consistency, architectural decision support, allocation optimization, model-level timing analysis, code generation, and the combination of model-based development and continuous integration practices. Along another line of research topics, he also works on real-time analysis, in particular focusing on shared stack usage and execution time analysis under limited preemption scheduling.
