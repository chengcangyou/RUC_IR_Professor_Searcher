We are interested in attaining a 3D understanding of the world around us, capturing and constructing semantically-informed 3D models of real-world environments. This includes 3D reconstruction and semantic understanding from commodity RGB-D sensor data, leveraging generative 3D deep learning towards enabling understanding and interaction with 3D scenes for content creation and virtual or robotic agents.
