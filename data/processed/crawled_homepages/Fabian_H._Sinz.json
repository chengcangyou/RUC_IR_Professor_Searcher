One central goal of AI research is to build intelligent systems that exceed the capabilities of biological brains. However, to date we know very little about how computations in neuronal circuits give rise to biological intelligence. Our group uses AI both as a testbed and a tool on large scale neuro-physiological and -anatomical data to better understand the constituent elements of neuronal intelligence. We are inspired by the idea that a deeper understanding of computational motifs in cortical circuits can help build the next generation of intelligent systems. We are based at the University GÃ¶ttingen. We closely collaborate with experimental and computational neuroscientists to develop new tools and experimental paradigms to discover principles of biological intelligence. Find us on BlueSky News September 2025 Paviâs paper on rendered 3D MEIS got accepted at the NeuREPS workshop 2025! September 2025 Finnâs paper got accepted at NeurIPS 2025! April 2025 The MICrONS package has finally been published in Nature. February 2025 Fabian is co-organizing the CAJAL NeuroAI course 2025. Applications are open now until Marth 7th! We have a great list of faculty covering topics from fly to human, and from anatomical models to reinforcement learning.
