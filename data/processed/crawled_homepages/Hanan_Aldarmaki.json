The methods she explores include unsupervised learning, transfer learning, and distant supervision to adapt text and speech models to languages and dialects for which labeled data are scarce or non-existent. This includes studying the regularities in text and speech patterns to discover and map terms across languages or modalities, such as unsupervised dictionary induction, cross-lingual embeddings of speech and text, and unsupervised speech-to-text mapping. Email Share Prior to joining MBZUAI, Professor Al Darmaki was an assistant professor in the department of computer science and software engineering at UAE University (UAEU). While completing her Ph.D., she worked as a teaching assistant and lecturer at George Washington University as well as on research projects at Apple Inc. and Amazon Web Services as an intern. Before starting her Ph.D., she worked as a statistical analyst at the Statistics Center-Abu Dhabi (SCAD), and as a network engineer at Dubai Electricity and Water Authority. Ph.D. in computer science from The George Washington University, USA Master of Philosophy in computer speech, text, and internet technology (CSTIT) from University of Cambridge, UK Bachelor of Science in computer engineering from American University of Sharjah, UAE Aldarmaki’s current research activities include natural language processing and speech applications for low-resource languages. She also works on developing open-source speech and language models and datasets for the Arabic language and dialects. “ArTST: Arabic Text and Speech Transformer”.
