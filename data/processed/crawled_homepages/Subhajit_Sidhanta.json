The preferred mode of collaboration is through a joint funded proposal to begin with. Any other forms of joint projects, workshops, or exchange programs are also most welcome.Subhajit is always in the lookout for enthusiastic and serious PhD, MTech, and BTech student to work in the  areas of Machine Learning (ML) for Systems, Multi-UAV Systems, and Internet of Things (IoT). Interested Ph.Dstudents are requested to apply formally through the IIT Kharagpur online application systemABOUT ME:Subhajit is an Assistant Professor with the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, working in the  area of edge computing, data analytics, distributed systems, and cloud computing. Before joining IIT Kgp, Subhajit was an Assistant Professor with the Department of  Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Bhilai, and before that Indian Institute of Technology, Jodhpur. Before this, Subhajit was a Postdoctoral Researcher working with the Distributed Systems research group at INESC-ID affiliated with University of Lisbon. He was working on a project funded by the European Research Consortium to develop a theoretical model of consistency and isolation levels of distributed systems under the supervision of Professor Rodrigo Rodriguez. Subhajit completed his Phd in Computer Science from Louisiana State University in August 2016. His dissertation was titled \"The performance trade off and SLA awareness in cloud computing and distributed datastores\". Subhajit publishes in top conferences and journals such as SRDS, CCGRID, IEEE CLOUD, IEEE SCC, etc.Subhajit also has 4 years of experience as software developer at IBM and PWC India, in java, databases, and internet technologies.Visit Subhajit's Linkedin profileVisit Subhajit's Github profileDetailed ResumeOrc_id: https://orcid.org/0009-0001-1023-3452COLLABORATIONS:Soumajit Pramanik, IIT BhilaiYogesh Simmhan, Indian Institute of Science, DREAM LabNirnay Ghosh, IIEST Shibput,  Institute webpageSupratik Mukhopadhyay, Louisiana State UniversitySushanta Karmakar, IIT Guwahati personal websiteResponsibilitiesReviewer for 2019 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)Reviewer for IEEE Transaction on ComputersCo-chair Organizing Committee of AGRINETS 2020 collocated with ICDCN 2020Treasurer and Organizing Committee member of Industry Academia Conclave at IIT BhilaiPC co-chair of Indosys 2019 onwardsProgram Committee member for IEEE Services Computing 2019Summer 2019: Organizer of Workshop on Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (WDSAI '19), IIT BhilaiReviewer for IEEE Transaction on Cloud Computing(TCC)Sub reviewer for 28th ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures (SPAA 2016)RESEARCH AREAS:Edge/Fog  ComputingArtificial IntelligenceInternet of ThingsDistributed storageData consistency and isolation levels.Client centric performance of distributed systemsPerformance modelling/optimization of big data processing systemsResource optimization in cloud and fogNewsTwo back to back Indian patent has been granted for our inventions \"QUALITY OF SERVICE AWARE CONTEXT SENSITIVE SYSTEM\" and \"AN UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE BASED SYSTEM FOR POST-DISASTER MANAGEMENT \".Our paper \"AerialDB: A federated peer-to-peer spatio-temporal edge datastore for drone fleets\" got accepted in Pervasive and Mobile Computing.
