Personal profile OpportunitiesPostgraduate Opportunities I am keen supervising self-motivated PhD students who have reesearch interests similar to mine. Apart from those who have backgroud in computer science, I am also happy to supervise  students who have background in Mathematics, Electrical & Electronic Engineering or Physics as long as they want to work on machine learning, machine perception and their applications to intelligent system development. So far I have supervised over 50 research students at different universities. If you are interested in working with me in MLP@UoM for your PhD studies, please visit my Research Student  page where one should be able to find my current PhD research project suggestions, key information on funding/qualification, proper inquiry/contact methods as well as other related information for research students. Anyone who is going to work with me for their PhD studies is strongly suggested visiting my Research Student  page prior to contacting me and then following the propoer inquiry procedure for efficient communication.

Data Science InstituteMachine Learning and OptimisationBiographyDr. Ke Chen is an academic staff member of School of Computer Science at The University of Manchester (UoM), where he directs the Machine Learning and Perception (MLP@UoM) Lab affiliated with the Machine Learning and Optimization Research Group. He does research and teaching in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science. His main research interests include machine learning, pattern recognition, machine perception, computational cognitive systems and their applications in intelligent system development. He has been with The University of Manchester since 2003. He was with Peking University, The University of Birmingham,  The Ohio State University, Kyushu Institute of Technology and Tsinghua University after receiving a PhD in computer science in 1990. He was a visiting senior researcher at Microsoft Research Asia and a visiting professor at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Dr. Chen has served on several editorial boards of international academic publications, e.g., a member of editorial board of Neural Networks (2011-present) and an associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks (2005-2010). He is the technical program co-chair of International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN'12) and has served as a member of technical program committees for numerous international conferences, e.g., IJCAI, IJCNN  and CogSci. In 2008 and 2009, he chaired  Intelligent Systems Applications Technical Committee (ISATC) and University Curricula Subcommittee of IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (IEEE CIS). He is now a member of IEEE Biometrics Council AdCOM (Representative of IEEE CIS) (2012, 2013), Neural Network Technical Committee (NNTC) and ISATC of IEEE Computational Intelligence Society . He was the chair of task force on Audio and Speech Processing of NNTC (2004-2007) and task force on Biometrics and Multimedia of ETTC (2005 and 2006) of IEEE Computational Intelligence Society.  He was a recipient of several academic awards, including NSFC Distinguished Principal Young Investigator Award (2001) and JSPS Research Award (1993). And he was an invited keynote speaker in ICONIP (2001). For the further information, please visit his up-to-date Home Page.Research interestsMy general areas of interest are artificial intelligence and computational cognitive science. In particular, I have been working in machine learning,  pattern recognition,  machine perception, computational cognitive systems and their applications in intelligent system development for over three decades. With the aforementioned fundamental researches, I am keen on developing effective and efficient techniques for real world applications.
