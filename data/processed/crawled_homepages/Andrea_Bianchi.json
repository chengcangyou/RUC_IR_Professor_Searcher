I research in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). I currently serve as Paper Co-Chair for UIST 2025 and Subcommittee Chair at CHI 2025 (Blending Interaction: Engineering Interactive Systems & Tools). The focus of my work is to design tools for computationally augmented physical interaction. In practice, I investigate how physical experiences can be augmented with digital artifacts, and how physical materials -including the human body- can be used as computational elements to expend the design space of computer-enabled interactions with the physical world. The physical interfaces resulting from this vision are tangible UIs, mechatronics devices for interacting with digital content, toolkits for fabrication and electronics, and wearable devices. My lab work has been recognized with 9+ Best Paper and Honorable Mention Awards at the premiere HCI venues. Before joining KAIST, he worked at Sungkyunkwan University (Korea) as a faculty member in the Department of Computer Science, and as a video game programmer for a New York startup. Andrea received a Ph.D. from KAIST (Korea) in 2012, an MS in Computer Science from NYU (USA), and a Laurea (BSc+MS) in business administration from Bocconi University (Italy). Andrea has an Erdős number of 3 and collects eyeglasses.
