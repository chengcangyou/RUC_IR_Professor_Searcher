I direct the Play and Learn Lab. We design culturally informed CS education technologies, and increase access to computer science education in sustainable ways for students from low income and underserved communities. Prior to Georgia Tech, I was a post-doctoral researcher at Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Academy. I have a PhD in Human Computer Interaction from Carnegie Mellon’s HCI Institute and was advised by Amy Ogan and Ken Koedinger. My research has contributed to the design of a tablet-based learning system used to supplement formal education by over 500 students in rural Tanzania, programmable video games codesigned with children to increase computational thinking and coding skills among low income and marginalized youth in the United States, codesign of a state-wide Artificial Intelligence middle school curriculum, and active collaboration with several schools and organizations. As a passion project, I review children’s storybooks that celebrate African history and culture.
