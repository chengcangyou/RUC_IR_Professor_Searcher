From December’16 to June’17, I worked as a researcher at Robert Bosch Research and Technology Centre, India. Prior to that, I was a research fellow in the Rapid-Rich Object Search (ROSE) Lab at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore working on large scale, deployable video surveillance systems. From October’14 to November’15, I worked as a post-doctoral fellow in the A*STAR-NUS Clinical Imaging Research Centre at National University of Singapore. I completed my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from University of California, Riverside under the supervision of Prof. Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury in August, 2014. I obtained my M.S. from the same institute in 2010 and prior to that, my bachelors in Electrical Engineering from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India. [Google Scholar]     [LinkedIn]     [CV]     [Visual Computing Lab] Research interests I am interested in developing novel computer vision and machine learning algorithms to solve visual analysis problems arising from diverse real-world applications. Majority of my current research can be categorized into three major thematic areas - Data-efficient & Privacy-preserving Deep Learning: zero-shot/few-shot knowledge distillation, continual learning, source-free/unsupervised domain adaptation, data-free adversarial defense, federated learning under data heterogeneity etc. Cross-modal Computer Vision: text-based image retrieval, sketch-guided localization, scene-graph generation, visual question answering etc. Perceiving Humans and their Actions: robust and scalable person-reidentification, video anomaly detection, human gait and pose analysis etc. In the past, I have worked on biological and medical image analysis problems (e.g., registration, cell segmentation, spatio-temporal cell tracking, cell and tissue resolution 3D reconstruction of confocal image stacks, analysis of clinical MR and CT images etc.). I am also interested in data-association problems on graphs and their applications to visual analytics tasks. Journal Publications DAD++: Improved Data-free Test Time Adversarial Defense G. K.
