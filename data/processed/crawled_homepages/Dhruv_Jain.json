CV | Soundability Lab I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, with affiliated appointments in the School of Information and Michigan Medicine. I direct the Soundability Lab, where we explore how hearing can become an editable, programmable interface—much like how web design lets us control layout, structure, and interaction on a page. We design human-centered AI systems that empower people to shape how they perceive and interact with sound. Learn more on my lab website. My research field is human-audio interaction, which sits at the intersection of HCI, Audio AI, Accessibility, and Hearing Health. I completed my PhD at the University of Washington and my MS at the MIT Media Lab. I’ve also worked at Microsoft Research, Google, and Apple. In 2023, I received the SIGCHI Outstanding Dissertation Award. I teach Accessible Computing, Audio AI, and User Interface Design at the undergraduate level, and Advanced Accessibility and Human-Computer Interaction at the graduate level. I also organize studio-style DIY workshops for students from diverse educational backgrounds; to date, I’ve led seven global workshops in five countries. Outside academia, I’m a certified scuba instructor. I advise businesses on effective prompting strategies to integrate generative AI into their workflows.
