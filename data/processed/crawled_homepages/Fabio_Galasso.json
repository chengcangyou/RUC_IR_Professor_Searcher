Our group is interested in fundamental research and innovation transfer in computer vision and machine learning, including applications to language models and robotics. Specific research interests include distributed and multi-agent intelligent systems, human-robot interaction, embodied perception, multi-modal learning involving hierarchical knowledge and uncertainty estimation, foundation and world models, general intelligence and reasoning, interpretable and safe AI. Fabio is co-founder and CTO of ItalAI (italailabs.com). We catalyze research and technological innovation in real-world scenarios. We accelerate and transfer ideas into products and novel start-ups, in the transformative spirit of the Silicon Valley. We integrate AI into workflows with custom solutions, driving new products, use cases, and efficiency. Previously, Fabio founded and directed the Computer Vision Department at OSRAM (Munich, Germany), an international team conducting R&D in artificial intelligence, computer vision and machine learning, in relation to smart lighting applications. We made long-term strategic propositions and cared about the entire life cycle of ideas, from the creation of new value propositions to the implementation of prototypes and pilots. Pilot installations included large industrial partners such as Edeka Supermarkets (smart retail) and the city of Ulm (smart city). Innovation transfer successes include the VISN product, which was awarded the 2019 IoT/WT Innovation World Cup, the 2019 Digital Champions Award, and the 2018 Deutscher Digital Award. Prior to OSRAM, Fabio conducted research on video analysis and segmentation, scene understanding and clustering at the University of Cambridge (UK) and the Max Planck Institute for Informatics (Germany). He received his Master's Degree cum laude from RomaTre University (Italy) and his PhD from the University of Cambridge (UK), Department of Engineering, following research work on texture analysis and 3D reconstruction. Before and after his Master's Degree, he gained experience as a Researcher in the Ericsson Laboratories and as a Project Engineer in Telecom Italia. In his career, he has been involved in consulting work relating to computer vision. Fabio has coordinated international European, and national Italian and German projects. He served as GC of ICIAP'25 (the Italian IAPR flagship conference). He regularly serves as (lead) AC at top-ranked international conferences, including CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, NeurIPS, ICML and ICLR, and co-organizes workshops. He is the inventor of 30 granted international patents. Web-site updated on October, 31st 2025 Google scholar | LinkedIn | Twitter Copyright © 2025 Fabio Galasso, All Rights Reserved",
