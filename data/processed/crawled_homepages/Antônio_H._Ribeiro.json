My work studies techniques to extract information and learn the intrinsic behavior of time series, signals and dynamical systems. I have a focus on large-scale models that can perform such tasks, with a special interest in their robustness and generalization capabilities. While motivated by a range of applications, I am particularly interested in the new prospects these advances can bring to medicine. In particular cardiology and electrocardiography.
