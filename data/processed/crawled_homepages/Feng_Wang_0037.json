D, MIEEE, MACM, SMCCF, Associate Professor School of Computer Science Wuhan University, China Email: fengwang AT whu DOT edu DOT cn Office: Room E306, Computer School Bldg, Wuhan University Brief CV Currently I am an associate professor of School of Computer Science in Wuhan University. I received my B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from Wuhan University in June 2003 and June 2008, respectively. From 2006 to 2008, I was a visiting student at Department of Computer Science of City University of Hong Kong, under the supervision of Professor Xiaotie Deng. And I continued my research with Professor Deng as a senior research assistant at City University of Hong Kong in 2010. From 2011 to 2012, I was doing postdoctoral research with Professor Ling Liu in the College of Computing at Georgia Institute of Technology. Research Interests My current research interests mainly include Machine Learning and Computational Intelligence. More specifically, I am interested in: Multi/Many Objective Optimization, Estimation of Distribution Algorithms and their applications in Financial/Economic problems; Deep Learning and its application in Image Processing.
