We develop computational models to replicate the behaviour and appearance of real world phenomena and people, in order to create richer virtual experiences. Another research direction I am interested in is the study of methods to create, interact with and understand visual data. We study methods to parse and understand visual data in the real world, and also develop tools and systems for generating and editing both 2D and 3D visual data. The work combines ideas from computer graphics, virtual and augmented reality, computer vision, applied physics and machine learning. It finds application in training and teaching, entertainment in films and games, medical simulation, industrial process simulation, software testing and digital heritage. I am a faculty member in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Bombay. Here I love teaching computer graphics to enthusiastic students. Earlier, I spent a couple of years daydreaming beside the picturesque Lake Geneva, as a postdoctoral reasearcher at MIRALab in the University of Geneva where I worked with Nadia Magnenat Thalmann. I spent some wonderful Ph.D. years at IIT Delhi, supervised by Prem Kalra and Subhashis Banerjee. In a prior academic life, I was a very serious undergraduate student in the Department of Civil Engineering, at the Delhi College of Engineering.
