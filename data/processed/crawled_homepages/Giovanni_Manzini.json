Pontecorvo 3, I-56127, Pisa, Italy E-Mail: first.last@unipi.it Short bio I received my PhD in Mathematics from the Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa. I have been Visiting Scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Visiting Professor at the Johns Hopkins University and the University of Melbourne. I have been Assistant Professor of Numerical Analysis at the University of Torino, and Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of Eastern Piedmont. I am currently Professor of Computer Science at the University of Pisa. In 2022 I was awarded the ACM Paris Kanellakis Theory and Practice Award for my contributions to the field of compressed indices. Being a mathematician by formation, I am particular proud that one of my most \"applicative\" papers was awarded the 2023 Test-of-Time Award of the European Symposium on Algoritms. Full CV. Research My current research interest is the design of algorithms and data structures for solving theoretical and applied problems in the fields of Data Compression and Indexing Data Structures for Massive Data Sets. Publications See: DBLP, ORCID, or Google Scholar. Recent publications still under embargo: Generalization of Repetitiveness Measures for Two-Dimensional Strings (SPIRE '24) Software Projects (since 2020) MMRepair: grammar compressed matrix multiplication EZcount: all-in-one pipeline for microRNA expression quantification BigBWT: construction of very large BWTs using Prefix Free Parsing BigRePair: grammar compressor for huge repetitive datasets Professional Service (since 2020) Member of the program committee of the conferences DCC '25, DCC '24, ALENEX ’23, DCC '23, SPIRE ’22, ICTCS ’22, LATIN ’22, DCC ’22, SPIRE ’21, SPIRE ’20, ICTCS ’20, CPM ’20. Teaching Over the years I have had the opportunity of teaching both basic and advanced courses on a wide range of subjects including: C/Java/Python/Ruby/Matlab/Scheme, Algorithms and Data Structures, Object Oriented Programming, Information Retrieval, Concurrent Programming, Discrete Mathematics, Bioinformatics, Mobile Applications Development, Cryptography, Computational Mathematics, Calculus, Numerical Analysis. In 2024/25 I am teaching Algorithms and Data structures for Data-intensive Applications and the undergraduate course Laboratorio 2, which covers the basics of C, Python, and Java, as well as concurrent programming in C and Python. Others I am a proud mentor of the Scuola Ortogonale of the Elicsir Foundation.",
