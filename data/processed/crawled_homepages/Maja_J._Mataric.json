As a pioneer of SAR and founder and director of the Interaction Lab at the University of Southern California, my research is aimed at endowing machines with the ability to help people, especially those with special needs. My lab's focus is on developing technologies that help people help themselves, using technology to augmentat human ability rather than to automate human work. I am passionate about conveying the importance and promise of interdisciplinary research and careers in STEM to all, with a particular focus on K-12 students and teachers, women and other underrepresented groups in engineering, the media, and policy makers.",
