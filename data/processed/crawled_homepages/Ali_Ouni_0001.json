STIL Lab is part of the department of Software Engineering and IT at ETS Montreal, University of Quebec.ETS Montreal is specialized in applied research and teaching in engineering and technology transfer, and ranked 1st in Quebec and 2nd in Canada for the total number of engineering diplomas awarded annually.About meAli Ouni is a passionate software engineering researcher and educator. He is a Full Professor in the Department of Software Engineering and IT at École de technologie superieure (ÉTS Montréal), University of Quebec, where he leads the Software Technology and Intelligence Research Lab (STIL). He is the recipient of several prestigeous awards including the CS-Can/Info-Can Outstanding Early Career Computer Science Researcher Award, in 2023, the Research Ecellence Award (Releve) of the University of Quebec in 2023, the Research Ecellence Award-Emerging Researcher from ÉTS Montreal in 2021. He obtained his PhD degree in computer science from the University of Montreal where he was awarded the J. Armand Bombardier Research Excellence Award. Before joining ETS Montreal, he has been an assistant professor at Osaka University, Japan, and UAE University. He has served as a visiting researcher at Missouri University of Science and Technology, and University of Michigan. He has developed pioneering research work in the area of software engineering, software maintenance and evolution, software quality, and empirical software engineering. He leverages advanced artificial intelligence techniques to address challenges related to software products, processes, and stakeholders. His research work has repeatedly published in top venues in software engineering. He is the recipient of over 10 Best Paper awards at top-tier conferences (ICSOC 2024, MSR 2024 Mining Track, SIGCSE 2024, ICSOC 2022, MSR 2021 Mining Track, ICGSE 2020, ICSR 2020, IWoR 2019, Energies 2018, ICWS 2016) and has been done in collaboration with and/or adopted by major industrial software companies. He won the 10-year Most Influential Paper Award (MIP) at IEEE ICPC 2021. He is a member of the IEEE.Software Technology and Intelligence Lab (STIL)The main goal of the STI Research Lab is to design, develop, evaluate and deploy techniques and solutions to solve software engineering problems in order to to help software practitioners improve their software systems more effectively and efficiently. In particular, the STI Lab uses various Artificial Intelligence (machine learning, metaheuristics, deep learning) and Data Science (data mining, data analysis, knowledge extraction, statistics) techniques to address various problems in software engineering. We have a specific interest and expertise in the following topics:Automating Software Development Using Artificial IntelligenceSearch Based Software EngineeringSoftware Maintenance and EvolutionSoftware RefactoringTechnical Debt and Software Quality AssuranceEmpirical Software EngineeringHuman aspects in Software EngineeringThe mission of the STI Research Lab includes:Designing, developing, deploying, and evaluating techniques, methods and tools to support software practitioners in developing and evolving complex software systems.Preparing students to leading positions in academia and in software industry.Looking for Students!The STI Research Lab is always looking for motivated and hard working PhD, Masters, and undergraduate students to work on challenging topics on software maintenance and evolution. For more details, please see the STI Lab’s research interests and current and previous work.If you are excited and motivated to work on related topics, then send an email to Dr. Ali Ouni (ali.ouni@etsmtl.ca) with your CV, achievements, publications (if any), and a brief note explaining why you want to join my research team. I would be happy also to discuss other well thought-out research ideas!",
