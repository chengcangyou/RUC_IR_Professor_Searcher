  "content": "Karthik Bhat Assistant Professor Dept. of Information Science College of Computing and Informatics Drexel University I am an Assistant Professor of Information Science at Drexel. I have a PhD in Human-Centered Computing from Georgia Tech. My research is situated at the intersections of health and wellbeing, care work, and human-AI interaction. I study how we can design and leverage emerging technologies to support the care work performed by doctors, nurses, community health workers, health aides, and family caregivers. I pay specific attention to how these technologies can be responsive to the sociocultural and socioeconomic factors that impact their adoption and acceptance in existing care practices. Prospective PhD students: Note (Fall 2026 Cycle): I am not accepting any new PhD students. If you are currently at Drexel: I am happy to take on undergraduate and graduate students who are interested in doing research for credit and research co-ops. Please send me an email with your research/project interests and your CV. If you are not at Drexel but would like to work with me: I am happy to support and mentor students in research projects and in leading research and publications.
