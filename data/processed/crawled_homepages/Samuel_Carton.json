  "content": "Samuel Carton I am an assistant professor of computer science at the University of New Hampshire. I did my PhD at the University of Michigan School of Information with Qiaozhu Mei and Paul Resnick, where I was affiliated with the Center for Social Media Responsibility. I did postdoctoral work with Chenhao Tan at University of Colorado Boulder and University of Chicago. My research is about human-centered NLP, with an emphasis on model interpretability as a means for achieving safer, more effective and ethical human-model collaboration when dealing with text. To that end, I am interested in both algorithmic and human-subjects work; both to create new methods for opening up models to human scrutiny, and running experiments to understand the human factors involved in that scrutiny.",
