He is probably best known for his involvement in open-source software projects, such as being the author of several C++ libraries he has contributed to Boost that are in use by thousands of developers worldwide. In his current research he focusses on leading the STE||AR Group at LSU’s Center for Computation and Technology working on the practical design and implementation of future execution models and programming methods using the HPX runtime system - a modern C++ library for concurrency and parallelism. His research interests are focused on the complex interaction of compiler technologies, runtime systems, active libraries, and modern system’s architectures. His goal is to enable the creation of a new generation of scientific applications in powerful, though complex environments, such as high-performance computing, distributed and cloud computing, spatial information systems, and compiler technologies.
