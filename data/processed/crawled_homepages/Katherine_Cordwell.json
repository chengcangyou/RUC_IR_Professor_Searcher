Her PhD is from Carnegie Mellon University's Computer Science Department. Her thesis, which won the 2024 Bill McCune PhD Award, was on formalizing algorithms for real quantifier elimination.Research InterestsHer research interests include formal verification, interactive theorem proving, and ways in which math and computer science intersect. She is particularly interested in formalizing mathematics and algorithms with safety-critical applications.Research Interests (Keywords)Formal Verification; Interactive Theorem Proving; MathematicsSelected PublicationsFormalizing Pick's Theorem in Isabelle/HOL.
