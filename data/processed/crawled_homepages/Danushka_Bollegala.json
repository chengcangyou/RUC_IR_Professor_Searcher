I lead the Machine Learning (ML) and NLP Research Groups. I am also an Amazon Scholar working at the cutting-edge information retrieval problems at Amazon Search. I am amazed by the human ability to understand languages and investigate methods to teach such skills to machines. For this purpose, I conduct research and publish the findings in Natural Language Processing (NLP) venues such as ACL, EMNLP, COLING etc. and Artificial Intelligence (AI) venues such as IJCAI and AAAI. I am attracted to simple and efficient ideas that are scalable and robust when applied to massive, noisy datasets as often encountered in real-world NLP applications used by millions of users world wide. I value the ability to create systems that are useful for humans and collaborate with industrial partners to establish the social and commercial impact of my research. I want to understand things deeply, and enjoy explaining those to students, colleagues as well as to the general public in simple terms. I often deliver research talks and lectures for this purpose. I have native-level proficiency in Sinhala, English and Japanese. I was born in Sri Lanka and have lived the major part of my life in Japan and the United Kingdom. Contact Works Deep Learning Text Book This is a one of the pioneering and best selling textbooks written in Japanese on Deep Learning. It covers both theoretical fundamentals of Deep Learning as well as its applications to various domains such as text and vision. Detail Machine Learning on Web Data This book, written in Japanse, explains the NLP techniques that are applicable on Web text mining. It is written for Web engineers. Detail Attributional and Relational Similarity on the Web This is the book covering my PhD thesis, where I studied methods for estimating attributional and relational similarity between words using information available on the Web. Detail Knowledge and Information Processing This text book written in Japanese was used by the undergraduate students at the University of Tokyo, specialising in communication engineering.
