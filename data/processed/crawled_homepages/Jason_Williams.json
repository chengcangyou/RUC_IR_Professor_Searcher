How to make the best use of limited computing resources, how to balance users’ needs with cybersecurity compliance, and the role of AI in the workplace are just a few questions that today’s information systems and FinTech professionals must grapple with. These complexities may make it difficult for students to apply knowledge from a classroom into the workplace. Therefore, teachers should teach not only from theory but should incorporate real world experience to make concepts more tangible and relatable to students. By combining theory with experience, I help students immediately apply theoretical knowledge to real world situations.

IT enables fundamental benefits in how people communicate, make decisions, and produce value in organizations. These benefits are realized through the use of technology (DeLone & McLean, 1992); therefore, I center my research on this critical construct. My other research streams, information quality, mis/disinformation, cybersecurity, and project management play key roles in how IT use occurs in organizations.
