About My interests lie in the intersection of Software Engineering, Software Security, Formal Methods, and Machine Learning. My research focuses on advancing Neuro-Symbolic AI to improve the scalability and efficiency of automated reasoning systems, while enabling AI models to develop reasoning and verification capabilities. Beyond foundational research, I design specialized Neuro-Symbolic methods to enhance software reliability, including modern AI systems, and explore verifiable code generation to make software development more trustworthy and error-resistant. I currently lead the Hiprel Group, where I fortunately work with a number of talented and motivated students. I did my PhD at The University of Texas at Austin, supervised by Sarfraz Khurshid. During my PhD, I have also been closely working with Kenneth McMillan and Darko Marinov. I am looking for self-motivated PhD (Fall 2026) and internship students (all year round) who share similar research interests with me and is interested in joining our Hiprel Group!
