A pioneer in big data software engineering, she led research on the role of data scientists in the software industry and redesigned developer tools for big data analytics including Apache Spark. Her work helped formalize the âdata scientistâ role at Microsoft, which in turn spurred a proliferation of new data science and AI programs in universities. Code clones cause redundant developer effort across organizations. Prof Kim was among the first to analyze recurring software changes using large-scale data from GitHub and Stack Overflow. Her work advanced understanding of API stability, refactoring identification, and large-scale refactoring in industry. Professor Kim has mentored several PhD students and postdoctoral researchers eight of whom now hold faculty appointments at institutions such as Columbia and Purdue. She has received the ACM SIGSOFT Influential Educator Award, served as FSE Program Co-Chair, delivered keynotes at ASE and ISSTA, and given distinguished lectures at CMU and UIUC. She has also worked with Microsoft Research and is an Amazon Scholar at AWS. Awards Professor Kim is an ACM Distinguished Member. Her honors include the ACM SIGSOFT Influential Educator Award, two ICSME Test of Time Awards, an NSF CAREER Award, a Humboldt Fellowship, and awards from Microsoft, IBM, Google, and the Okawa Foundation. History Professor Kim graduated as No. 1 among all students in KAIST and received the Korean Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology Award, the highest honor given to an undergraduate student. She completed her MS and PhD at the University of Washington under David Notkin and held faculty positions at UT Austin and UCLA. She served eight years as faculty-in-residence, received the Doc Stevenson Award , and created Mommy Computer Science Camp, featured in PC Magazine .
