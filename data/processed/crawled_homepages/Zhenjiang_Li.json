He received the B.E. degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University, China, and the M.Phil and Ph.D. degrees from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong. He is currently on the editorial board of IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing. Hiring: We are constantly looking for self-motivated PhD students/RAs to join us. Research Interests: Artificial Internet of Things (AIoT) Systems and Smart Sensing Edge/Embedded AI and Large Language Model (LLM) Systems Low-Power and high-performance IoT We develop Artificial Internet of Things (AIoT) systems to power next-generation digital societies, including smart cities, embodied robotics, and low-altitude economy applications. We drive this process through three interconnected pillars: (1) smart human-centric sensing, (2) efficient embedded machine learning (ML), and (3) high-performance IoT transmissions. Selected Publications (More) The underlined names are the students and postdoctoral researchers in our group.
