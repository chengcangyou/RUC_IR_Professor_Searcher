As such, the evolution of these kinds of defenses require specialized experiments that can capture their behavior and effectiveness through time, as well as their broader impacts in the network. While specialized experiments can be constructed to evaluate specific defenses, there is a need for a general approach that will facilitate such tasks. In this work we introduce VINE, a high-fidelity cyber experimentation environment designed for the study and evaluation of dynamic and moving target defenses. VINE provides a common infrastructure supporting the construction, deployment, execution, and monitoring of complex mission-driven network scenarios that are fully instrumented. The tool was designed to be scalable, extensible, and highly configurable to enable the study of cyber defense strategies under dynamic background traffic and attack conditions, making VINE well-suited for the study of adaptive and moving target defenses. In this paper we introduce the VINE approach, the VINE architecture for MTD experimentation, and provide an illustrative example of the framework in action.Download Continuous flow analogical reasoningThis work describes a theoretical model of analogical reasoning.

The ability to reason by analogy – the identification, adaptation, and application of previously acquired knowledge to new situations – is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, playing key roles in recognition, classification, learning, general and scientific problem solving, and creativity. The Continuous Flow Analogical Reasoning (CFAR) theory integrates a number of human experimental results by describing how the key sub-processes of analogical reasoning – encoding, retrieval, mapping, and evaluation – execute in parallel and have influence on each other, and the outcome of the reasoning process. A computational model of CFAR has been implemented and demonstrates how manipulating order and interactions among the subprocesses produces results that are consistent with a wide variety of human experiments on analogical retrieval, mapping, and use. Formal Assurance for Cognitive Architecture Based Autonomous AgentNASA Formal Methods, May 16, 2017Autonomous systems are designed and deployed in different modeling paradigms. These environments ... more Autonomous systems are designed and deployed in different modeling paradigms. These environments focus on specific concepts in designing the system. We focus our effort in the use of cognitive architectures to design autonomous agents to collaborate with humans to accomplish tasks in a mission. Our research focuses on introducing formal assurance methods to verify the behavior of agents designed in Soar, by translating the agent to the formal verification environment Uppaal.Download Assurance for Integrating Advanced Algorithms in Autonomous Safety-Critical SystemsIEEE Systems Journal, 2020Although advanced algorithms are needed to enable increasingly autonomous civil aviation applicat... more Although advanced algorithms are needed to enable increasingly autonomous civil aviation applications, there are limitations in assurance technologies, which must be addressed to gain trust in the performance of these algorithms. This gap emphasizes the need to guarantee safety by capturing performance boundaries, as these algorithms are integrated. Additionally, multiple similar algorithms might need to be executed sequentially or concurrently to accomplish a mission or provide guidance for safety-critical operations. The selection among algorithm functionalities is a complex and critical activity that needs to be systematically designed and analyzed before actual implementation. Toward this end, we discuss our proposed process, which includes formally modeling abstractions of the algorithms in an architectural framework, then identifying the key performance parameters, followed by verification of the composition of these algorithms with formal contracts based on assumptions and guarantees. Finally, to reduce the gap between design and implementation, an automated translation from the architectural model to source code has been developed, which is a Java-based outline of the implementation. We demonstrate our compositional approach in assuring the behavior of an autonomous aerial system via a collision avoidance case study with advanced algorithms to handle critical emerging situations. Skills in Applied Concept MappingDownload Formal Assurance for Cooperative Intelligent Autonomous AgentsLecture Notes in Computer Science, 2018Developing trust in intelligent agents requires understanding the full capabilities of the agent,... more Developing trust in intelligent agents requires understanding the full capabilities of the agent, including the boundaries beyond which the agent is not designed to operate. This paper focuses on applying formal verification methods to identify these boundary conditions in order to ensure the proper design for the effective operation of the human-agent team. The approach involves creating an executable specification of the human-machine interaction in a cognitive architecture, which incorporates the expression of learning behavior. The model is then translated into a formal language, where verification and validation activities can occur in an automated fashion. We illustrate our approach through the design of an intelligent copilot that teams with a human in a takeoff operation, while a contingency scenario involving an engineout is potentially executed. The formal verification and counterexample generation enables increased confidence in the designed procedures and behavior of the intelligent copilot system.Download Preliminary Insights into Enhancing Human-Robot TeamworkAdvancements in robotics, artificial intelligence, and other automation have highlighted the need... more Advancements in robotics, artificial intelligence, and other automation have highlighted the need for humans to work together with machines in a more flexible and collaborative fashion than previously possible. To formulate effective human-robot teams, it is critical to understand which factors play important roles in enhancing human-robot teamwork. To gain preliminary insights into key factors of effective human-robot teams, we carried out an experiment using an enhanced version of the \"Lunar Lander\" game, where the goal is to safely land a spacecraft on the moon's surface in concert with an AI teammate. We specifically attempted to observe some patterns of communication across high-performing teams in the experiment. Due to the limited number of experimental participants, the results of the experiment did not definitively identify the factors that account for effective teams. Instead, the experiment indicated potential avenues to further investigate, including intent-oriented communication and trust in teams with human and non-human entities. This paper presents findings from the experiment and discusses future work to extend the scope of the study to include teleoperation of unmanned vehicles with communication delay.Download Neuroergonomics of Cursor Control Devices in Spacecraft Cockpits for Spaceflight ParticipantsNeuroergonomics and Cognitive EngineeringThe commercial space transportation industry is rapidly growing with increasing numbers of spacef... more The commercial space transportation industry is rapidly growing with increasing numbers of spaceflight participants (SFPs). These private individuals receive considerably less training than astronauts before embarking on space missions, which presents an urgent need to develop the cognitive ergonomics that simplify spacecraft cockpit design. Neuroergonomics is an emerging area within cognitive ergonomics, which Parasuraman described as “the study of brain and behavior at work”. This experimental study investigated the neuroergonomics of cursor control devices (CCDs) for spacecraft cockpits by applying electroencephalography (EEG) power indices as objective measures of concentration, relaxation, effort, fatigue, arousal, valence, and absorption during task performance. Data for this study were collected from a sample of twenty-seven participants who performed a Fitt’s cursor control task in PsyToolkit with a counterbalanced device sequence of four different CCDs, i.e., touchpad, touc...
