I'm also affiliated with the Computer Security group at CWI. I work on methods that help practitioners write correct, secure and reliable systems, where I focus on keeping user effort low. My research interests span programming languages, security and systems. 📄 CV ✉️ Email 🔬 Research Statement 🎓 Teaching Statement 📝 Blog Open Positions: I'm looking for students at all levels. I have open positions for PhDs and post-docs. If you're interested in the intersection of Security, Programming Languages and Formal Verification, please email me. Research Team I'm currently working with this talented group of researchers: Robin Webbers PhD Student (2022-) Alp Adnan Basar PhD Student (2024-) Luís Ferreirinha PhD Student (2024-) Wind Wong PhD Student (2025-) Zunchen Huang Post-doc (2024-) Robert Schenck Post-doc (2025-) Recent News 🏆🏆🏆 I've been awarded the ERC Starting Grant (1.5 Mio € personal grant) for my research on building side-channel free systems. I will be hiring soon, please reach out if you're interested. Our paper on refinement type refutations has been accepted at OOPSLA'24. Check out this blog post where we describe the ideas. 🏆 Our paper on verifying leakage contracts for hardware received an honorable mention in the Intel hardware security award'24. 🏆 Our paper on verifying leakage contracts for hardware has received a distinguished paper award at CCS'23. 🏆 Our paper \"Randomized Testing of Byzantine Fault Tolerant Algorithms\" has been awarded a distinguished paper award at OOPSLA'23. Bio Before coming to the VU, I was a post-doc in the Programming Systems group at UCSD where I worked with Ranjit Jhala and Deian Stefan. Before that, I was a PhD student at TUM where I was advised by Andrey Rybalchenko and funded through a Microsoft Research scholarship. During my PhD I worked at Microsoft Research Cambridge as an intern and spent some more time there as a visitor. I received both a BSc. and MSc. in computer science from TUM with a minor in logic and philosophy of science at LMU. During my master's, I spent five months at Université Paris Diderot.
