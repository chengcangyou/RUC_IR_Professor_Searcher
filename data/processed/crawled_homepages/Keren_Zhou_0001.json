Before joining GMU, I was a full-time Member of Technical Staff at OpenAI. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Rice University, advised by Professor John Mellor-Crummey. Previously, I studied at Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Professor Guangming Tan’s PAA group. Prior to that, I was an undergraduate student at Yunnan University, advised by Professor Wei Zhou.Interests High Performance Computing Parallel Algorithms Program Analysis Machine LearningEducationPhD in Computer Science, 2022Rice UniversityMS in Computer Science, 2017Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of SciencesBE in Network Engineering, 2014School of Software, Yunnan UniversityRecent NewsSep 2025 [Travel] Attended ICPP'25July 2025 [Travel] Attended OSDI'25Apr 2025 [Education] Guest lectured Harvard CS 205: High Performance Computing for Science and EngineeringMar 2025 [Travel] Attended Linux Foundation Member Summit'25Mar 2025 [Travel] Attended PPoPP/CGO/HPCA'25 More news…Experience     Member of Technical StaffOpenAINovember 2023 – Present FairfaxTriton Compiler     Assistant ProfessorGeorge Mason UniversityAugust 2023 – Present FairfaxComputer Architecture/Compiler/Machine Learning Systems     Member of Technical StaffOpenAIJune 2022 – August 2023 San FranciscoPerformance Optimization of Deep Learning Workloads     Software Engineering InternNVIDIAMay 2021 – August 2021 RemotePerformance Profiling for Deep Learning Frameworks     Software Engineering InternGoogleMay 2020 – August 2020 RemotePerformance Regression Analysis of Feedback-direct Optimization (FDO) Based Programs     Research InternMetaJune 2018 – August 2018 Menlo ParkNeural Network Optimization on Mobiles     Research InternNVIDIAApril 2017 – July 2017 BeijingNeural Network Quantization     Software Engineering InternBaiduOctober 2014 – February 2015 BeijingHadoop Workflow OptimizationProjects*GPAGPA is a performance advisor for NVIDIA GPUs that suggests potential code optimization opportunities at a hierarchy of levels, including individual lines, loops, and functions. GPA uses data flow analysis to approximately attribute measured instruction stalls to their root causes and uses information about a program’s structure and the GPU to match inefficiency patterns with suggestions for optimization. GPA estimates each optimization’s speedup based on a PC sampling-based performance model.CodeHPCToolkitOur tool provides a profile view and a trace view for GPU-accelerated applications. The profile view identifies where GPU APIs are invoked in CPU calling context, approximates calling context for GPU execution, and analyzes instruction mix for GPU kernels. The tool traces CPU and GPU activities for a large number of processes and threads with minimal overhead.Code DOCTritonTriton is a language and compiler for writing highly efficient custom Deep-Learning primitives. The aim of Triton is to provide an open-source environment for expressing tensor math workloads that offers high flexibility, developer productivity and end to end performance.Code DOCGVProfWe implemented GVProf, the first value profiler that locates value redundancy problems in applications running on GPU-based clusters. Our experiments show that GVProf incurs acceptable overhead and scales to large executions. GVProf provides useful insights to guide performance optimization. Under the guidance of GVProf, we optimized several HPC and machine learning workloads, obtaining speedups up to 1.93x.Code DOCFeatured PublicationsKPerfIR: Towards an Open and Compiler-centric Ecosystem for GPU Kernel Performance Tooling on Modern AI WorkloadsAn open, compiler-focused infrastructure for profiling and optimizing GPU kernels on AI workloads.Yue Guan, Yuanwei Fang, Keren Zhou, Corbin Robeck, Manman Ren, Zhongkai Yu, Yufei Ding, Adnan AzizCite DOI PDF arXivDeepContext: A Context-aware, Cross-platform, and Cross-framework Tool for Performance Profiling and Analysis of Deep Learning WorkloadsPerformance profiling toolkit that unifies deep learning workload analysis across platforms and frameworks.Qidong Zhao, Hao Wu, Yuming Hao, Zilingfeng Ye, Jiajia Li, Xu Liu, Keren ZhouCite DOI arXivTriton-Viz: Visualizing GPU Programming in AI CoursesGPU programming is a critical component in AI system courses, which is notoriously difficult to learn and teach, given its unique …Tejas Ramesh, Alexander Rush, Xu Liu, Binqian Yin, Keren Zhou, Shuyin JiaoCite Project URLAn Automated Tool for Analysis and Tuning of GPU-Accelerated Code in HPC ApplicationsThe US Department of Energy’s fastest supercomputers and forthcoming exascale systems employ Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to …Keren Zhou, Xiaozhu Meng, Ryuichi Sai, Dejan Grubisic, John Mellor-CrummeyCite Project DOI URLValueExpert: Exploring Value Patterns in GPU-Accelerated ApplicationsGeneral-purpose GPUs have become common in modern computing systems to accelerate applications in many domains, including machine …Keren Zhou, Yueming Hao, John Mellor-Crummey, Xiaozhu Meng, Xu LiuCite Project DOI URLSee all publications Recent PublicationsQuickly discover relevant content by filtering publications.
