Our group's mission is to harmonize the precision of scientific computing with the agility and adaptability of machine learning, paving the way for breakthroughs in both theoretical and applied domains. We delve into: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Focused on developing AI-based recommender systems for combat aircraft, with a special emphasis on emitter classification and multi-sensor data fusion. Additionally, there's a key focus on constructing platform engineering frameworks for the integration of diverse ML models. In the educational sector, the approach includes creating AI-driven predictive models based on learners' activities and developing tools for skill and performance assessments. Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) Our research is centered on integrating advanced parallel computing techniques, especially high-performance (hp) Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and GPU acceleration, to enhance computational efficiency and accuracy. By infusing traditional numerical schemes with data-driven approaches, we align our work with the forefront of SciML trends, ensuring a harmonious blend of scientific precision and technological innovation. Machine Learning\tOperations (MLOps) Crafting scalable ML algorithms suited for diverse computational environments. Innovating in distributed training techniques and cloud computing applications. Implementing rigorous ML model and data version control systems. Establishing efficient CI/CD pipelines for ML deployment and operations. Scientific Foundation Models Moving beyond traditional simulation, we are developing \"Intelligent Surrogates\"âLarge Science Models (LSMs) that learn the laws of physics. This research powers the creation of Digital Twins and enables real-time validation for critical engineering systems, directly fueling the innovation engine at ZenteiQ.
