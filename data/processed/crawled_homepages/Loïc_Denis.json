Annino 42 000 Saint-Etienne France Latest news Sept 2025: I am teaching a new introductory course on deep learning and computer vision at Telecom Saint-Etienne. You can have a look at the lecture notes here (60 pages long document). Sept 2025: I have been actively involved in an international collaboration with Norway to develop novel techniques to analyze images of the Arctic. This collaboration with the University of TromsÃ¸ in Norway and Telecom Paris in France has led to a new approach to jointly despeckle and compensate the thermal noise in Sentinel-1 images of sea ice. Check out our paper describing the method (preprint,doi). I could visit the University of TromsÃ¸ in May 2023. It was a great experience to meet the group working on sea ice, exchange ideas on SAR image processing, and discover Norway above the Arctic circle! Jan 2025: Self-supervised learning is a very elegant approach to train deep neural networks. We demonstrated in 2021 that synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging was, surprisingly, ideally suited for learning despeckling networks without a reference [Dalsasso, Denis, Tupin 2021]. This is because SAR images are complex-valued, and the speckle phenomenon can be modeled as a stochastic perturbation operating independently in the real and imaginary components of SAR images. For multi-channel SAR images (polarimetric and/or interferometric SAR), the complex amplitudes captured in the different channels are correlated according to the polarimetric and/or interferometric properties of the scene. Self-supervised learning does not apply out of the box. Yet, extending self-supervised learning to these images has remained a highly motivating research goal! After considering many alternatives, we found out that we could circumvent the problem by projecting multi-channel images to form single-channel projections for which self-supervised learning can operate. Interestingly, after despeckling each projection independently, it is still possible to invert the projection process and recover the full multi-channel information (i.e., reconstruct the full covariance matrix at each pixel). To perform self-supervised multi-channel despeckling, it suffices to work on projections! Check out our new paper: \"Just Project! Multichannel Despeckling, the Easy Way,\" which describes this novel approach (IEEExplore,ArXiV). March 2023: A post-doc position on Generative models and representation learning for synthetic aperture radar imaging is open at the University of Saint-Etienne! September 2022: I now hold a full-professor position at the UniversitÃ© Jean Monnet Saint-Etienne. I will develop artificial intelligence and image processing techniques with a special focus on applications in physics: Earth observation (synthetic aperture radar), astrophysics (especially exoplanets detection & characterization), microscopy for surface and biological sample imaging. I am thrilled to conduct these projects at the Laboratoire Hubert Curien where cutting-edge research is developed both in optics/photonics and computer science! July 2022: Emanuele Dalsasso presented a paper at the conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar imaging EUSAR on strategies for self-supervised training in order to suppress speckle in images. He was awarded the 2nd place at the Student Paper Award competition for his presentation. Congratulations Emanuele! July 2022: We were deeply honored to receive the 2021 IEEE GRSS Symposium Prize Paper Award during IEEE IGARSS conference held this month in Malaysia for our paper \"Exploiting multi-temporal information for improved speckle reduction of Sentinel-1 SAR images by deep learning\" (IEEEXplore link, ArXiV version). This paper is the joint work of Emanuele Dalsasso and InÃ¨s Meraoumia who work with Florence Tupin and me on deep neural networks for SAR image restoration. January 2022: I am serving as an Associate Editor for the IEEE transactions on Image Processing. More information on the journal can be found here. December 2021: I am giving a tutorial presentation on speckle reduction for a workshop on High-precision BRDF measurement. The slides of my talk are available here. November 2021: Are deep neural networks performing magic? Some results achieved by neural nets are truly amazing but anyone who has trained neural networks knows that making these networks work can be a very tedious task, starting by the building of training sets. In that respect, self-supervised training techniques are a relief since they offer a way to train the networks on raw data, without ground-truth. In our recent work \"As if by magic: self-supervised training of deep despeckling networks with MERLIN\", we show that, somewhat surprisingly, single look complex SAR images have all we need to train despeckling networks in a self-supervised fashion. We believe that this may have huge implications in the way networks can be trained to process SAR data. November 2021: Image restoration is an important task in remote sensing. We describe many different approaches that were developed for synthetic aperture radar imaging or hyperspectral imaging in this recent review paper. March 2020: Olivier Flasseur received an award for his PhD on the detection and reconstrution of weak signals in images. The award acknowledges the excellent research Olivier conducted during his PhD at the University of Saint-Etienne. Olivier has developed extremely sensisitive detection methods used to search for exoplanets in astronomy or microscopic objects in biomedical imaging. Congratulations Olivier! January 2020: Directly imaging exoplanets is an incredible scientific challenge that requires combining a very large telescope, an extremely efficient adaptive optics in order to correctly focus most of the light from the host star on a coronagraphic mask, multi-temporal and/or multi-spectral acquisitions and elaborate data processing techniques. We have been working on the data-processing end lately and are proud to have accomplished a significant progress thanks to the PhD work of Olivier Flasseur, the post-doc of Anthony Berdeu, and our ongoing collaboration with the Observatory of Lyon. Our most recent works cover an accurate modeling of integral-field spectrometers for instrumental calibration and multi-spectral reconstruction (PIC method) and algorithms to detect and characterize exo-planets (the PACO algorithm, its robust version and a multispectral extension).
