I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from POSTECH where I was advised by Prof. Hwanjo Yu. During my Ph.D., I was fortunate to work as a visiting scholar at UT Health, under the supervision of Prof. Xiaoqian Jiang. After completing my Ph.D., I worked as a postdoctoral research fellow at the UIUC with my advisor, Prof. Jiawei Han.
