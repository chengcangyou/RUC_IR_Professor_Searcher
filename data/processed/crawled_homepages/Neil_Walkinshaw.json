He subsequently spent five years (2005-2010) as a postdoc at the University of Sheffield, working on state machine inference and software testing (an area in which he is still active).This was followed by 8 years as a Lecturer then Senior Lecturer / Associate Professor at the Department of Informatics at the University of Leicester. He took up his current position as a Senior Lecturer at the University of Sheffield in 2018. Research interests Dr Walkinshaw's research and teaching focus is on software quality assurance. His research has a particular emphasis on “black-box” components - software units that lack documentation and cannot be scrutinised internally.He specialises in applying Machine Learning and other data analysis algorithms to the specific activities of testing, reverse-engineering, and safety-case assessment.
