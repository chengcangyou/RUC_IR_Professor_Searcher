I was working with Prof. Luc Van Gool as a postdoctoral researcher at the Computer Vision Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Switzerland. I obtained my PhD degree under the supervision of Prof. Dong Xu from the Nanyang Technological University(NTU) on 2015. I also worked closely with Prof. Ivor Wai-Hung Tsang during my PhD. News I join the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China(UESTC) as a faculty member at the School of Computer Science and Engineering. Two papers are accepted by ICCV 2019. Our work on Augmented Distribution Alignment, which provides a new analysis on semi-supervised learning from the perspective of distribution mismatch, is accepted as an oral paper. [Code] [Paper]. Our team won the second place at CVPR 2019 WAD D2-City & BDD100K Detection Domain Adaptation Challenge. Code of Collaborative and Adervasial Networks (CAN) can be found here [Code]. Code of Domain Adaptive Faster R-CNN has been released [Code]. The paper of our WebVision database is available now [Arxiv] [Project Website] [CVPR 2017 Workshop][CVPR 2018 Workshop] The codes of SHFA and HFA algorithms are available now[codes]. A fast implementation of kernel SVM+ is released. The codes of linear SVM+ will also be released soon. [codes].
