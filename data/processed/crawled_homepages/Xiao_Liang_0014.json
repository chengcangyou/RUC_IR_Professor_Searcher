I'm interested in Cryptography and its intersections with related fields such as Quantum Computing, Computational Complexity, and Computer Security. My work has concentrated on theoretical fundamentals, including Zero-Knowledge Protocols, Secure Multi-Party Computation, Non-Malleability, Digital Signatures, as well as their practical applications. I'm lucky to work with a group of curious and creative students. Together, we form the CryptoPlus Lab! Prior to my appointment at CUHK, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at NTT Research, working with Vipul Goyal. Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at Rice University, working with Nai-Hui Chia and Kai-Min Chung. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stony Brook University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Omkant Pandey. Before that, I received an M.S. in Applied Math from Stony Brook University, and a Bachelor of Economics from Beijing Institute of Technology.

I used to write Chinese poetry (both classical and modern) and won the 2nd prize at the 2015 Chinese Poetry Writing Competition for Chinese-Speaking Undergrads and Grads. Check my award-winning work with comments from the famous lyricist and poet Vincent Fang (Chinese: 方文山). [More works of me] I won the National Scholarship when I majored in Economics, an area in which I have since lost interest.
