His research interests are artificial intelligence, reasoning about knowledge, planning and logic. He was member of the team LOGICA at IRISA. Teaching Tableaunoir Tableaunoir is an online collaborative blackboard. You can also create interactive animations via the use of \"fridge magnets\". Classes I mainly teach theoretical computer science, but also programming. Photo of magnets I use to teach sorting algorithms. I love to use unplugged material in my classes. Pedagogical Software I love to develop pedagogical online tools. The picture is the screenshot of Hintikka's World for learning modal logic. Contributions to Wikipedia I love to contribute to Wikipedia pages in computer science. Click here to see my contributions to Wikimedia. I also organize some projects in some classes in which students contribute on the topics of the lectures. Textbooks Compilation : analyse lexicale et syntaxique, co-written with Romain Legendre Kripke's Worlds, co-written with Olivier Gasquet, Andreas Herzig, Bilal Said Logique : fondement et applications, co-written with Pierre Le Barbenchon and Sophie Pinchinat Research Epistemic reasoning in AI I study epistemic reasoning, that is, the abilities of agents to reason about higher-order knowledge/beliefs (an agent believes that another one knows that...). See my habilitation thesis. Connected multi-agent path finding I am now also working on automated planning for multiple agents. EpiRL: Epistemic Reinforcement Learning In this project, we aim at investigating the combination of epistemic planning and reinforcement learning.
