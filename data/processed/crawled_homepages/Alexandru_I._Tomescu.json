Tomescu Homepage • Publications • Software • Teaching and Supervision Professor at the Department of Computer Science, University of Helsinki, where I lead the Graph Algorithms and Bioinformatics group. We are part of the Algorithmic Bioinformatics lab. From September 2025, my research is partly funded by an ERC Consolidator Grant on scalable graph algorithms for bioinformatics. See also this article about our research. Previously, I obtained the ERC Starting Grant on safe and complete algorithms for bioinformatics. Research interests My team and I do research at the intersection of Bioinformatics and Theoretical Computer Science (with a focus on Graph Algorithms): RNA transcript assembly × network flows, flow decompositions, (minimum) path covers pangenomics × graph decompositions, string matching in graphs, co-linear chaining, complexity lower-bounds (SETH-based) genome assembly × safe and complete algorithms for graph problems, de Bruijn graph construction and k-mer compression practical approaches × Integer Linear Programming, parameterized algorithms, approximation algorithms, enumeration sequence comparison and protein evolution × safe and complete algorithms for dynamic programming problems Contact Postal address: Department of Computer Science, P.O.
