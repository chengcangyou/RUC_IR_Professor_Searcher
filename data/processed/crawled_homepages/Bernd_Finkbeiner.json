He obtained his Ph.D. in 2003 from Stanford University. Since 2003, he leads the Reactive Systems Group, which became part of CISPA in 2020. His research focus is the development of reliable guarantees for the safety and security of computer systems, including specification, program synthesis and repair, and static and dynamic verification. Major projects include output-sensitive algorithms for reactive synthesis (â  OSARES), logics and algorithms for hyperproperties (â  HYPER), and the stream-based monitoring of cyber-physical systems (â  RTLOLA). Project HYPER Logics and Algorithms for a Unified Theory of Hyperproperties ERC Advanced Grant 2022-2027 Contact CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security phone: â­+49 681 870832059â¬ eMail: finkbeiner at cispa.de Teaching Winter 2024/25: Automata, Games and Verification (advanced lecture) The theory of automata over infinite objects provides a succinct, expressive, and formal framework for reasoning about reactive systems, such as communication protocols and control systems. Reactive systems are characterized by their nonterminating behaviour and persistent interaction with their environment. In this course we will study the main ingredients of this elegant theory, and its application to automatic verification (model checking) and program synthesis.
