His work aims to capture subtle statistical properties in dynamic data, such as nonlinear cross-temporal dependencies, complex seasonal patterns, time-varying uncertainty, intermittency, and heterogeneity. Email Share Prior to joining MBZUAI, Professor Ben Taieb was Associate Professor of Machine Learning at the University of Mons (UMONS) in Belgium, where he led the Big Data and Machine Learning Lab. Before that he served as a lecturer in Business Analytics in the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics at Monash University in Melbourne, which he joined after a postdoctoral research fellowship in the Spatio-Temporal Statistics and Data Science group at KAUST in Saudi Arabia. Professor Ben Taieb has won various research grants in academia and through industry collaborations, including joint research with Huawei, John Cockerill, and Ion Beam Applications. He received a Doctoral Research Fellowship from the Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research and was awarded the Solvay Award for the best Ph.D. thesis. He is currently associate editor of the International Journal of Forecasting and regularly reviews for leading machine learning conferences and statistics journals.
