More specifically I focus at present in Software Product Lines on the use of model checkers for the analysis of feature-behaviour interaction and family-oriented verification. As to Dynamic System Adaptation, Paradigm and Reo are two languages that have my interest. I aim to develop methods for the modelling dynamic migration trajectories and related validation techniques. I mainly use the mCRL2 and Prism modelcheckers for tool support. My research is conducted in the broader context of the research group on Formal System Analysis of Eindhoven University of Technology.
