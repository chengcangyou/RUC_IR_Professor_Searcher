Some specific topics include: Latent variable models with identifiability guarantees, which enables us to discover patterns in an unsupervised fashion, including nonnegative matrix factorization, bounded/independent component analysis, dictionary learning, and tensor decomposition. Non-convex optimization algorithms that are computationally efficient and (hopefully) with optimality guarantees. Applications in various areas, including data analytics, natural language processing, and computer vision. News Feb. 2023, NSF CAREER Award Dec. 2022, 2022 IEEE Signal Processing Society Donald G.
