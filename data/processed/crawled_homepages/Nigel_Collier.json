Recent areas of focus include LLM evaluations - including adversarial attacks and policy violations, understanding uncertainty, reasoning and issues around synthetic personalities.  I also have a long running interest in NLP applications particularly in biomedicine and epidemiology that involve state of the art models and illustrate interesting challenges.Prospective PhD students: I am always interested to supervise new NLP projects on the PhD in Computation, Cognition and Language.   Before contacting me please make sure that you meet the minimum requirements and take time to check out my publications.  The work we do in my team is technical and experiment-based so please apply only if you have strong programming skills.  In your email please send a CV with a brief statement of research interests.  Please note the application deadline and documents you need to submit with your application.  Note for 2026 applicants: I will accept 2 or 3 PhDs in 2026, and also the MPhil by Research in language sciences offers places to applicants with an NLP background. This can be a great springboard to PhD research.Enquiries for postdoctoral opportunities are welcome.  When needed I can help explore funding sources for fellowships from UK, EU and other agencies. Over the years many people have contributed to the research and publications in my lab. Here's a list of current students, postdocs and alumni. Nigel Collier, Professor of Natural Language ProcessingThe Language Technology Lab, Faculty of Modern and Medieval Languages and Linguistics, University of Cambridge, 9 West Road, Cambridge CB3 9DB, United KingdomTel: +44 (0)1223-760373Email: nhc30 [AT] cam dot ac dot ukOffice: Room TR-23, English Faculty BuildingORCID ID: 0000-0002-7230-4164 Follow on Twitter | Slideshare | LinkedInGoogle SitesReport abusePage detailsPage updated Google SitesReport abuse",
