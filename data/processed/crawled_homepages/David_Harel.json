These included computability (especially levels of undecidability), logics of programs (especially dynamic logic), database theory (especially query languages and their power), and automata theory.  My current activity is in software and systems engineering, visual languages and their underlying methodologies and tools, the modeling and analysis of biological systems, the synthesis and communication of smell, and the analysis of prosody.
