Previously, I completed a BA in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge in 2009, followed by an MSc in Informatics at the University of Edinburgh in 2010. I then worked at Blackford Analysis for four years, on research and development for medical imaging applications. I completed my PhD in 2018 at the University of Edinburgh in the CALVIN group supervised by Vittorio Ferrari (see here for my thesis). I spent three years as a postdoc in the Computer Vision and Machine Learning Group of Christoph Lampert at ISTA, the Institute of Science and Technology Austria. Research interests My research focuses on building machines that understand the visual world with minimal human input. More specifically I work on generative AI, probabilistic machine learning, and minimally-supervised approaches to 3D computer vision. I also have various projects applying these methods in the physical sciences, healthcare and computer graphics.
