Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at the University of Oxford, working with Andrea Vedaldi and Andrew Zisserman. I completed my Ph.D. at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, under the supervision of Andreas Geiger. My research focuses on computer vision for autonomous driving. In recent years, I’ve published work on topics such as 3D Gaussian Splatting, point tracking, and end-to-end learning of autonomous driving. I lead a small research group with amazing students. We work on a broad range of topics at the intersection of computer vision and autonomous driving. We’re always looking for enthusiastic students to join us. If interested, check open positions. Feel free to reach out via email. For updates, follow me on X and our group on Instagram. News Our work with Shadi, in collaboration with OpenDriveLab, is accepted at ICCV25! Check out “ETA: Efficiency through Thinking Ahead, A Dual Approach to Self-Driving with Large Models“. New preprint from Sadra, in collaboration with Matteo and Fabio: “WarpRF: Multi-View Consistency for Training-Free Uncertainty Quantification and Applications in Radiance Fields“. Görkay received the Academic Excellence Award 🏆! I gave a talk at “Embodied Intelligence for Autonomous Systems on the Horizon” workshop at CVPR25, check it out on YouTube! I gave a talk at the Workshop on Pixel-level Vision Foundation Models at CVPR25. We organized the Workshop on Uncertainty Quantification for Computer Vision at CVPR25. Our work with Nazir and Youssef, titled “A Likelihood Ratio-Based Approach to Segmenting Unknown Objects“, has been finally accepted at IJCV! We presented our work Track On at ICLR in Singapore with Görkay! Our EuroHPC JU proposal was accepted! We will continue using the supercomputer Leonardo for another year.
