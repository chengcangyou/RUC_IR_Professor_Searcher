I received my Ph.D. from the University of Padova in 2013, advised by Gianfranco Bilardi. Then, I was a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Pittsburgh (2013-2014), working with Kirk Pruhs, at the University of Houston (2014-2017), working with Gopal Pandurangan, and at KTH Royal Institute of Technology (2017-2018), working with Danupon Nanongkai. I am interested in the design and analysis of algorithms.
