I am also a Chief Scientist at Link Oregon, and currently serve as technical advisor and consultant for several startups. My research spans the interdisciplinary areas of networks, systems, and security---where packets fly, infrastructures evolve, and bad actors keep things interesting. You can find me on LinkedIn. Full Bio Ramakrishnan (Ram) Durairajan is an Associate Professor in the School of Computer and Data Sciences, and co-directs the Oregon Networking Research Group (ONRG) at the University of Oregon. Ram earned his Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in Computer Sciences from the University of Wisconsin - Madison and his B.Tech. in Information Technology from the College of Engineering, Guindy (CEG), Anna University. Ram has been leading a team of super-talented graduate and undergraduate students in federal, university, and industry research projects totaling over $5 Million. He has published over 50 peer-reviewed papers in various conferences, journals, and workshops. His research has been recognized with several awards including the NSF CAREER award, NSF CRII award, Ripple faculty fellowship, UO faculty research award, best paper awards from ACM CoNEXT and ACM SIGCOMM GAIA, and has been covered in several fora (NYTimes, MIT Technology Review, Popular Science, Boston Globe, Gizmodo, Mashable, among others). Recently, his research on Internet topology has been named as \"One of the 100 Greatest Innovations,\" has been used in FCC's Spectrum Frontiers 2d Report and Order, and has won a number of awards including the \"Best of What's New\" (in security category) by the Popular Science Magazine. Ram routinely serves as a technical advisor and consultant for startups and companies on a wide variety of networking and cybersecurity issues including network monitoring and analytics, network data science, cloud networking, secure network architectures, among others.
