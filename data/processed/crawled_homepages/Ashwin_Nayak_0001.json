After holding post-doctoral positions at DIMACS Center (Rutgers University and AT&T Labs-Research), and California Institute of Technology, I joined University of Waterloo in 2002. I was an associate faculty member at Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics during 2003–11. My research primarily revolves around quantum information and computation, with an emphasis on algorithms, complexity, and communication. I continue to work more broadly on related topics in theoretical computer science.
