We develop new methods and algorithms to make sense of large-scale neuroscience data. Moreover, we work on novel approaches to computer vision based on insights we gain from biological vision. Currently, the Neural Data Science Group has 14 PhD students and 2 postdocs. Data Science is a highly collaborative endeavour. We work closely with a number of labs in GÃ¶ttingen, Germany and the United States: Fabian Sinz (Uni GÃ¶ttingen) Andreas Tolias (Baylor College of Medicine; Houston, TX, USA) Thomas Euler (University of TÃ¼bingen) Tim Gollisch (University Medical Center, GÃ¶ttingen) Claudia Fichtel (German Primate Center) Julia Ostner + Oliver SchÃ¼lke (Uni GÃ¶ttingen/German Primate Center) Alexander Gail (German Primate Center) Christoph Kleinn (Uni GÃ¶ttingen) Eberhard Bodenschatz + Mohsen Bagheri (MPI for Dynamics and Self-Organization, GÃ¶ttingen) Viola Priesemann (MPI for Dynamics and Self-Organization, GÃ¶ttingen) Michael Wibral (Uni GÃ¶ttingen) Michael Wilczek (Uni Bayreuth) Teaching Winter term 2025/2026 Current Topics in Deep Learning Seminar where recent deep learning papers are presented and discussed. Alexander Ecker, Nina Nellen, Felix Benjamin MÃ¼ller Summer term 2025 Deep Learning for Image Synthesis Practical course on applying deep learning for image generation. Alexander Ecker and Timo LÃ¼ddecke Lecture Machine Learning Introduction to Machine Learning Alexander Ecker Winter term 2024/2025 Current Topics in Deep Learning (Foundation Models: From Deep Learning to Neuroscience) Seminar where recent deep learning papers are presented and discussed. Alexander Ecker, Michaela VystrÄilovÃ¡, Felix Benjamin MÃ¼ller Lecture Graph Machine Learning Introduction to Graph Machine Learning Martin Ritzert, Alexander Ecker, and Felix MÃ¼ller Bachelor’s and Master’s theses General requirements If you’re interested in joining our lab for a thesis, have a look at this document describing how we work and what we expect from you. We expect prospective students to have substantial knowledge in machine learning, its mathematical foundations and Python programming. We therefore expect students interested in doing their thesis in our lab to take our courses on Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Computer Vision unless they have acquired equivalent knowledge otherwise. For Bachelor’s students, we also recommend the Practical Course Data Science. Further recommended courses are: M.Inf.2241: Current Topics in Machine Learning (seminar) M.Inf.2541: Current Topics in Computational Neuroscience (seminar) M.Inf.2242: Journal Club Machine Learning and Computational Neuroscience (can be done in parallel to masterâs thesis) M.Inf.2201: Probabilistic Machine Learning (by Fabian Sinz) B.Inf.1240: Visualization (by Bernhard Schmitzer) B.Phy.5601: Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience I B.Phy.5602: Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience II M.Psy.901: From Vision to Action B.Psy.902: Biologische Psychologie: Neurowissenschaften B.Phy.5676: Computer Vision and Robotics Please note, our thesis supervision capacity is limited and we receive more thesis inquiries than we are able supervise. Therefore, we have to select candidates. If you are interested, please write an email with the subject “Master’s thesis” or “Bachelor’s thesis” containing one to three sentences about what you would like to work on and your study record to the supervisor stated below. We will get back to you within a few days. Otherwise, do not hesitate to remind us :).

Ecker An unsupervised map of excitatory neurons' dendritic morphology in the mouse visual cortex Nature Communications, 2025 show abstract Neurons in the neocortex exhibit astonishing morphological diversity, which is critical for properly wiring neural circuits and giving neurons their functional properties. However, the organizational principles underlying this morphological diversity remain an open question. Here, we took a data-driven approach using graph-based machine learning methods to obtain a low-dimensional morphological âbar codeâ describing more than 30,000 excitatory neurons in mouse visual areas V1, AL, and RL that were reconstructed from the millimeter scale MICrONS serial-section electron microscopy volume. Contrary to previous classifications into discrete morphological types (m-types), our data-driven approach suggests that the morphological landscape of cortical excitatory neurons is better described as a continuum, with a few notable exceptions in layers 5 and 6. Dendritic morphologies in layers 2â3 exhibited a trend towards a decreasing width of the dendritic arbor and a smaller tuft with increasing cortical depth. Inter-area differences were most evident in layer 4, where V1 contained more atufted neurons than higher visual areas. Moreover, we discovered neurons in V1 on the border to layer 5, which avoided deeper layers with their dendrites. In summary, we suggest that excitatory neuronsâ morphological diversity is better understood by considering axes of variation than using distinct m-types. @article{weis2025unsupervised, title= {An unsupervised map of excitatory neurons' dendritic morphology in the mouse visual cortex}, author= {Weis, Marissa A. and Papadopoulos, Stelios and Hansel, Laura and LÃ¼ddecke, Timo and Celii, Brendan and Fahey, Paul G. and Wang, Eric Y. and Bae, J.
