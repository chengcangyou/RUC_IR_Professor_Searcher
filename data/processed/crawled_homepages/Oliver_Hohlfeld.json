Before, I was professor at Brandenburg University of Technoligy and headded the Computer Networks group. Prior to that, I was at RWTH Aachen University, and before I was with Anja Feldmann at TU Berlin / Deutsche Telekom Innovation Laboratories. I was a visiting scholar at the group of Paul Barford at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, USA.I studied computer science at Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences, Institute Eurecom (Sophia Antipolis, France) and Darmstadt University of Technology and hold a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) and Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree. From 2004 to 2006 I was with the Fraunhofer IGD where I worked on network architectures for telemedical applications. I obtained a Ph.D. (Dr. rer. nat.) from TU Berlin in 2013 (Advisor: Anja Feldmann).I am a Senior Member of the ACM.InterestsNetwork SecurityNetwork MeasurementsInternet architecture / protocolsQuality of Experience / Psychological StudiesEducationDr. rer. nat.
