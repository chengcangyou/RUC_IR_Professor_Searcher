Marina Institute for Computing Systems Architecture (ICSA) School of Informatics The University of Edinburgh E-mail: mahesh<at>ed.ac.uk Phone: +44 (0)131 650 5125 Fax: +44 (0)131 651 5651 Room 1.20, Informatics Forum (Central area campus) 10 Crichton Street Edinburgh, EH8 9AB Scotland, UK Biography I’m a Professor in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh and a Visiting Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. Previously, I was a Turing Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute for five years (2018-23). At Edinburgh, I have served as the Director of Institute for Computing Systems Architecture (one of the six research institutes within Informatics) between August 2018 and July 2022. Earlier, I held visiting roles at ETH Zurich and at Ofcom London. Before joining Edinburgh, I had a two-year postdoctoral stint at the UCLA Computer Science Department in the Mobile Systems Laboratory headed by Prof. Rajive Bagrodia. I earned my PhD in Computer Science from the State University of New York at Stony Brook, where my advisor was Prof. Samir Das. I’m an IEEE Fellow and an ACM Distinguished Member. Research My research is in the area of networked systems with a focus on wireless networks and mobile/edge systems. My current research interests also include cloud service assurance, edge computing, sustainable computing and networking, machine learning systems and quantum systems. My recent research has been mainly on the following topics: Software-oriented mobile networking systems (CoreKube [MobiCom'23], Nervion [MobiCom'21], WhiteHaul [MobiSys'20], Iris [JSAC'19], Orion [MobiCom'17], FlexRAN [CoNEXT'16]) Generative AI applications in networking (DeepSpace (SIGCOMM'25), SpotLight [MobiCom'24], NetGSR [CoNEXT'24], GenDT [CoNEXT'22], AppShot [TNSM'22], CartaGenie [PerCom'22], SpectraGAN [CoNEXT'21]) Network automation and optimization through tailored data-driven and machine learning techniques Monitoring, troubleshooting and orchestration (NetGSR [CoNEXT'24], SpotLight [MobiCom'24], [JSAC'23], PAINT [ICNP'22], JADE [INFOCOM'22], [TNSM'20]) Energy efficiency and sustainable networking ([SIGMETRICS'24], GreenRAN [INFOCOM'21]) Efficient spectrum sharing (Iris [JSAC'19], [TCCN'19]) Earth observation and networking with LEO satellites (DeepSpace (SIGCOMM'25), [WWW'24]) Within Informatics@Edinburgh, I lead the Networked Systems (NetSys) Group. I'm also part of the Quantum Informatics Group and the Security, Privacy and Trust Group.
