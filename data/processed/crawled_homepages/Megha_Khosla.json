My primary area of research is machine learning on graph structured data. Specifically, I develop algorithms to enable effective, interpretable, and privacy preserving learning on graphs. Prior to my being a faculty member at TUD, I was a senior research at the L3S Research Centre, and the Leibniz University Hannover. I have also managed several collaborative projects both in Academia and in the industry where I spent a three-year stint after my PhD. I completed my PhD from the Max Planck Institute for Informatics (MPII), in Algorithms and the Complexity group, Saarbruecken, Germany.
