Before that, I was a postdoc at UC Berkeley in the Sky lab, working with Ion Stoica and a PhD student at Stanford working with Peter Bailis and Matei Zaharia. My research focuses on making analytics with machine learning easy for scientists and analysts to use. For my dissertation, my work has had a particular emphasis on video analytics and data systems for deploying ML. I’ve also helped develop DawnBench and MLPerf. My research is and has been supported by Google, the Open Philanthropy project, Emergent Ventures, and others. You can find my writing here, mostly on research. In my spare time, I’ve consulted at OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, hedge funds, and other companies to support their ML deployments, and advised a number of startups. Reach out if you’re interested in chatting. I am always looking to work with motivated and ambitious students, and I am actively recruiting students at all levels to work with me. If you are interested in working with me, please reach out to me at [first initial][first initial][last name] at g.illinois.edu (the g is intentional).
