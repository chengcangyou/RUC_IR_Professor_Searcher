I am interested in probability, dynamics and group theory, and in their applications to topics in microeconomic theory, including information, risk and uncertainty, and social choice. I am a member of the Caltech CSIS interdisciplinary research group, and the chair of Caltech's undergrad admissions committee. I got my B.Sc. in computer science and physics from Tel Aviv University, where I participated in the search for extrasolar planets with Tsevi Mazeh. In 2013 I received my Ph.D. in mathematics from the Weizmann Institute, advised by Elchanan Mossel. From 2013 until 2015 I was a Schramm postdoctoral fellow at the MIT math department / Microsoft Research, where I previously was an intern of Adam Kalai. I have been at Caltech since 2015. Email me at [email protected], or visit me in Baxter Hall, room 213. Support I am (or have been) supported by a MURI grant (N000142412742), a Sloan research fellowship in mathematics, an NSF CAREER award (DMS-1944153), a BSF award, and a Simons foundation award.
