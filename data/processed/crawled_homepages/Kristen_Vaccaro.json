I'm particularly interested in questions of agency and control, but also user understanding, justice, and policy. I often work on social computing applications (like news feed curation and content moderation) but I'm also interested in other areas, including my early work on fashion! I'm looking for students to work with, including PhD students joining UCSD! If you're interested, I have some more information here!
