His research leverages cutting-edge AI technologies using large-scale multi-modality medical data including imaging, medical records, gene data and models the clinicians’ medical knowledge underlying tasks like diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment for eye (ophthalmology), skin (dermatology), heart (cardiovascular) and neurodegeneration diseases such as epilepsy and multiple sclerosis. He is also one of Australia’s most in-demand experts in technology, including medical robotics and artificial intelligence, and is a passionate science communicator. He currently holds the tenure position of Associate Professor at the Monash University, the Faculty of IT and the Faculty of Engineering. He also holds NVIDIA AI Fellowship and serves as the Chief Scientist at Monash-Airdoc Research Centre. He is the Founding Director of the Monash Medical AI group (https://www.monash.edu/mmai-group) with over fully funded 30+ PhD students (internal + external), and 5 Research Fellows. His research has helped attract more than 35+ million dollars in funding as either primary chief investigator or leading chief investigator from grant bodies, including the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF), The Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC), CSIRO, The Australian Research Council (ARC) and industry funding from NVIDIA, The Agilent Thought Leader Program, Molemap/Kahu, Ascertain, Shukun and Airdoc. His h-index is 40, with 10000+ citations only five years post PhD. Zongyuan has strong publication record of 100+ first or senior author top-tier (ERA ranking A*/A) journals and technical conferences in the machine learning and medical AI field. His research papers have been published in top-tier journals and conferences such as The Lancet Digital Health (IF=36.615), The British Medical Journal (IF=96.22), JAMA Neurology (IF=29.91), Nature Nanotechnology (IF=39.21), Brief in Bioinformatics (IF=11.62), Hypertension (IF=10.19), IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (IF=24.31), IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging (TMI) (IF=10.048), Medical Imaging Analysis (IF=13.83) and top-tier conference including NeurIPS, ICLR, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, KDD, AAAI, IJCAI and MICCAI. His work has been recognised by many international and national awards, including the 200 Most Qualified Young Researchers in Computer and Mathematics by the Scientific Committee of the Heidelberg Laureate Foundation, IBM Scientific Research Accomplishment Award, IBM Manager Choice Award, NVIDIA AI Fellowship, the Agilent Thought Leader Program, the Australian Pattern Recognition Society (APRS) Early Career Researcher Award in 2021 and Monash Exceptional Achievement Award. The products developed by Airdoc and his team have also won honours such as “the highest award of artificial intelligence in China”–Wu Wenjun Award for Artificial Intelligence Science and Technology twice in 2019, 2022 and “the case of Microsoft global AI cooperation in 2018 World Artificial Intelligence Conference”. As a lifelong medical technology entrepreneur, he has led and contributed to several international research projects in the areas of dermatology, ophthalmology, radiology, and neurology with major industry companies like IBM Watson Health, medical technology unicorn company Airdoc/Eyetelligence and medical/healthcare services providers such as Molemap Clinic, The Alfred Health, Royal Melbourne Hospital, and Princess Alexandra Hospital. A/Prof Ge is also the Chief Scientist for the Airdoc Research Centre (https://www.airdoc.com/) to lead the AI technology and product development team. In 2019, he helped build the Monash-Airdoc Research Centre (with 3.5m total investment) to help developed CFDA, NDPR, CLASS III approved healthcare monitoring products. This eye disease diagnosis AI product has served millions of people in China, India, Japan, South Africa and Australia. According to the financial report, the revenue generated from the ophthalmology AI products A/Prof Ge’s team co-developed has generated 25 million dollars in revenue for the company. Airdoc has been successfully listed on Hongkong Stock Exchange (2251-HK) with a market cap of over 1 billion US dollars (2021, Dec). A/Prof Ge is actively engaged in the scientific community. He coordinates the NVIDIA Student Ambassador Program as the certified NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI) instructor in Victoria Australia and runs the Monash-NVIDIA joint centre daily activities, and assists NVIDIA in building a strong AI ecosystem in Australia by delivering one-day AI courses, organising deep learning workshops and giving keynotes, plenaries to general science communities. He is on the program/technical committee of several top-tier conferences, such as AAAI and IJCAI, and associate editor/reviewer for journals such as Scientific report, IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging and IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence. As part of the steering group at the Monash Data Science and AI platform, Zongyuan’s industry expertise developed at IBM and NVIDIA has helped his collaborators to define the prototype of the machine learning algorithm for the healthcare data platform HELIX (https://www.monash.edu/researchinfrastructure/helix/home). His role with Monash eResearch centre and data science & AI platform provides Monash researchers and their collaborators with the ability to access several High-Performance Computing facilities and data science services. This includes the Monash-hosted national specialised data-processing facility for medical imaging and visualisation.Community serviceProfessional Memberships and Service Community University Ambassador & Certified Instructor for NVIDIA DLI Global ProgramThe Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) Scientific Advisory CommitteeSteering Group member, Monash Data Science and AI platformResearch Advisory Committee, Australian Centre of Excellence Melanoma Imaging Diagnosis (ACEMID)Member at Large, Australian Pattern Recognition Society (APRS)Panel Assessors, Monash University School of Translational Medicine, Faculty of MedicineISAIR Board of Directors, Oceania Vice-ChairCognitive Robotics, Editorial Board MemberScientific Reports, Associate EditorArtificial intelligence for mobile robotic networks, Editorial Board MemberSensors SI, Guest EditorICPR, Industry CommitteeMRFF AI Workshop CoordinatorACCV 2022, Organising Committee, Web ChairDICTA 2020 (Australasian B), General ChairAAAI 2019-2022 (CORE A*) Technical CommitteeIJCAI 2019-2021 (CORE A*) Technical Committee ISAIR 2017-2022, General Chair, Program Co-Chair, Area ChairROSNET 2020 program committeeInternational Conference on Database Systems 2019, Advanced Applications Tutorial Organiser Review Transactions on Medical Imaging (TMI)Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)Medical Imaging Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI)IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI)IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications (DICTA)IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP)IEEE Transaction on Multimedia (ToM)ELSEVIER Computers & Electrical EngineeringInternational Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science (AMCS)IBM Journal of Research and DevelopmentJournal of Biomedical and Health InformaticsConsulting Zongyuan’s dermatology work is a joint collaboration between industry company Molemap Ltd and research institute. This work has been awarded for IBM Scientific Research Accomplishment Award and IBM Manager Choice Award. These findings have pushed forward the AI implementation in the field of skin cancer screening service and generated over one million revenue from the product. This research led to 4 technical PIC conference papers (2 as lead-author), an abstract presented in Dermatology World Congress 2017, one clinical journal (under preparation for submission to JAMA Dermatology) and 2 patent filed. Zongyuan’s recent AI work on ophthalmology has lead a team of 12 research engineers and built a fundus based eye disease screening system. The system is able to provide diagnosis suggestion over more than 36 fundus diseases including diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma. This system is trained over 5 million images labelled by over 100 ophthalmologists for 3 years. In 2018, this system has provided eye care service for more than 8 million people in major health checking institutes and major hospitals.
