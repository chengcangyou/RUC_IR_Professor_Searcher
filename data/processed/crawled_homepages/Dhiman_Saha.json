Recently I am focusing on : Automated Cryptanalysis Classical and Quantum Symmetric-Key Cryptanalysis Lightweight Cryptography Lattice Based Cryptography My research group calls itself the de.ci.phe.red LAB. news Nov 29, 2025 My research group is organizing the National Workshop on Cryptology 2025 from 7-9 December and a first of its kind Crypto Winter School 2025 from 9-12 December. Details are available at NWC and CWS respectively. Jun 18, 2025 Our paper titled Cryptanalysis of NLFSR-Based Lightweight Ciphers TinyJAMBU, KATAN, and KTANTAN has been accepted/published in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory. This is a joint work with Amit Jana (ISI Kolkata) and Mostafizar Rahman (University of Hyogo). Read more Jun 1, 2025 Our paper titled ToFA: Towards Fault Analysis of GIFT and GIFT-like Ciphers Leveraging Truncated Impossible Differentials has been accepted/published in TCHES 2025. This is a joint work with Anup Kumar Kundu (ISI Kolkata), Shibam Ghosh (University of Haifa/Inria), and Aikata Aikata (TU Graz). Read more Sep 13, 2024 Our paper titled Simple vs. vectorial: exploiting structural symmetry to beat the ZeroSum distinguisher has been accepted/published in Designs, Codes and Cryptography. This is a joint work with Sahiba Suryawanshi (IIT Bhilai), Shibam Ghosh (University of Haifa), and Prathamesh Ram (IIT Bhilai). Read more Aug 25, 2024 Our paper on Multiple-Tweak Differential Attack Against SCARF got accepted at ASIACRYPT 2024. This is a joint work with Christina (UniversitÃ© Paris CitÃ©), Shahram (Ruhr University Bochum) and Yosuke (NTT Social Informatics Laboratories).
