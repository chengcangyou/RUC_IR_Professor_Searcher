Dr Cirstea currently leads the COVER project (COalgebraic foundations for quantitative VERification), funded by the Leverhulme Trust and joint with the University of Starthclyde. This project aims to build new foundations for quantitative verification, grounded in a coalgebraic modelling of systems, and aimed at expanding the scope of quantitative verification and improving its scalability.
