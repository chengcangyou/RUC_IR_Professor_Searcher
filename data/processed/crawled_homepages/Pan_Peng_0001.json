I was a long-term participant at UC Berkeley's Simons Institute program in Sublinear Algorithms. I was a lecturer (assistant professor) in the Department of Computer Science at University of Sheffield, UK. Before that, I held postdoc positions of TU Dortmund, Germany at the research group of Prof. Christian Sohler and University of Vienna, Austria at the research group of Prof. Monika Henzinger. I got my Ph.D under supervision of Prof. Angsheng Li, in the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2013. I received my bachelor degree in Mathematics from Beijing Normal University in 2007. My research interests lie at the intersection of theoretical computer science, network science, and data science. Currently, I am focused on sublinear algorithms, graph algorithms, and the privacy and robustness of algorithms.
