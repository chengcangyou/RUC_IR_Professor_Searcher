He obtained his PhD from Trinity College Dublin in 2004 and is a member of the SRA ICT-The Next Generation, a platform for the recruitment of talented faculty at KTH. His research interests relate to Socially Interactive Agents and Embodied AI. They include the investigation of interrelationships between computational visual attention, affect, memory, theory of mind and gaze control models for real-time control, perception of, and multimodal interaction with humanoid agents, groups and crowds (i.e. multi-agent systems) in urban and other spatial contexts. These works cross the domains of virtual characters, physical social/mobile robots and computer graphics/virtual reality. To this end, Peters has participated in numerous national and international projects, including the EU FP6 Network of Excellence HUMAINE, EU FP6 Focused Research Project CALLAS and Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) funded METROPOLIS. He was the PI for KTH in the EU Horizon 2020 Innovation project ProsocialLearn, and is the PI for KTH in the EU Horizon 2020 MSCA Innovative Training Networks ANIMATAS and CLIPE.
