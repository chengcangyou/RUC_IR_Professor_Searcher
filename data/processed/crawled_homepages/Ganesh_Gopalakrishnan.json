Principal Investigator, \"NSF REU Site: Trust and Reproducibility of Intelligent Computation.\" SITE. Recent Highlights (TL; DR) You will find SLIDES that I recently used in my lectures on these topics: How Silicon gets manufactured and why it matters to know; includes image of inverse photolithography, and how tin drops get ablated :-) The basics of Floating-Point Arithmetic (gut-level); My first attempt at explaining how a GPT works, including simple GPTs that learn N-gram languages (cf. Karpathy) of a DFA (created using Jove). How we have used SMT to study floating-point specifications of GPU Tensor Cores. Mostly this is an intro to Z3 by Phil Zucker. Then an encoding of the Ken-Ken Game. Then more stuff on FP modeling (Benjamin Valpey's NASA Formal Methods Best Paper â gist). These lectures were given at the SPARC Lecture Series, May 26â29, 2025, National Institute of Technology (NIT), Calicut, Kerala, India. PLDI 2025 Array Workshop: Paper + Slides are available HERE. And the talk video is HERE. Free Automata and Computability using Google Colab (Activity Edition Book) HERE with An Overview Video. (Book approved for release by Taylor and Francis â but please cite them when using the book.) Funding Acknowledgements NOTE: The following grants are listed as an acknowledgement to various funding agencies sponsoring my research. I HAVE FILLED ALL VACANCIES of RAships associated with these grants. I do not expect to take on a new RA till at least Fall 2025. Prof. Ganesh Gopalakrishnan's research is funded by the Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research under award number DE-SC0024042 under the XStack Project (DOE Office of Science). Their project 'ComPort : Rigorous Testing Methods to Safeguard Software Porting' investigates methods to port software reliably across upcoming hardware. Prof. Ganesh Gopalakrishnan's research is also funded by several NSF projects. Most of his papers and software involve multiple of these projects (given the small amounts of money per project). Each paper and software item is therefore collectively attributed to all these NSF projects.
