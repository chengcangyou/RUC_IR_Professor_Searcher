I'm mainly interested in the design, analysis, and implementation of randomized algorithms, in particular for similarity search and differential privacy. I am affiliated with the Providentia project at University of Copenhagen. Previously, I was an assistant professor and a postdoc at ITU. I obtained my PhD in 2015 from Technische UniversitÃ¤t Ilmenau under the supervision of Martin Dietzfelbinger.
