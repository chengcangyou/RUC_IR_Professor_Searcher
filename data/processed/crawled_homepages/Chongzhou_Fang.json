Prior to that, I obtained my Doctoral degree at University of California, Davis. My main research interest lies in system and hardware security. I focus on both cloud scheduler security and side-channel attack & defense in heterogeneous computing resources like FPGAs. I also expolore how LLM techniques can be applied to the field of cybersecurity.[I’m hiring!] I am looking for 1–2 highly motivated Ph.D. students to start in Fall 2026 at RIT. I am also recruiting master students who are already at RIT to join my lab. If you’re interested, please email me your CV along with any relevant supporting materials (e.g., finished papers, demos). My email: cxfeec at rit.edu You are also welcome to drop by my office if you are already at RIT!Let’s explore the world of computer security together!Publication Highlights[NDSS'26] Know Me by My Pulse: Toward Practical Continuous Authentication on Wearable Devices via Wrist-Worn PPG Wei Shao, Zequan Liang, Ruoyu Zhang, Ruijie Fang, Ning Miao, Ehsan Kourkchi, Setareh Rafatirad, Houman Homayoun and Chongzhou Fang[UsenixSecurity'24] Large Language Models for Code Analysis: Do LLMs Really Do Their Job?
