My research broadly connects to the fields of human-computer interaction, applied artificial intelligence and machine learning, computational social science, and behavioral sciences. I use both experimental and computational approaches to examine how to better utilize the wisdom of crowd to enhance machine intelligence (i.e., crowdsourcing and social computing), and how to better design intelligent systems that people can understand, trust and engage with effectively (i.e., human-AI interaction). Prior to Purdue, I spent a year at Microsoft Research New York City as a postdoctoral researcher in the Computational Social Science group. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Harvard University, and received my bachelor degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. Publications In most cases, my collaborators and I choose to have students as first authors and then determine the authorship alphabetically.
