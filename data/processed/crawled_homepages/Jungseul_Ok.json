He completed Ph.D program in  School of Electrical Engineering at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), South Korea, under the supervision of Prof. Yung Yi and Prof. Jinwoo Shin. After graduation, he worked with Prof. Alexandre Proutiere and Prof. Sewoong Oh as a postdoctoral researcher, respectively, in School of Electrical Engineering at KTH, Stockholm, Sweden, and Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington, WA, US. His current research focuses on fundamental machine learning frameworks for agentic AI, including hierarchical reinforcement learning, structured exploration, LLM-based planning, active learning, and foundational dataset construction.NoticeI’m looking for motivated graduate students, postdocs, and interns interested in tackling exciting machine learning problems.
