Abstract: Real-time systems are pervasive in the automotive, robotics, smart industry, manufacturing, and healthcare domains, where the system’s safety, dependability, or quality of service depends on both functional and temporal correctness, namely, performing the right actions at the right time. Sep 6, 2023 Joris op ten Berg successfully defended his Master thesis (with Cum Laude) entitled 'QoS-Aware CPU Scheduling on Simulated Multi-Core Hardware'. Congratulations, Joris! Abstract: 3D-stacking is a new approach to building CPUs that has the potential to increase performance thanks to low memory access latency. However, stacking components on top of each other increases power density, which results in worse thermals. Aug 28, 2023 Jurre Wolff successfully defended his Master thesis (with Cum Laude) entitled 'QoS-Aware CPU Scheduling on Simulated Multi-Core Hardware'. Congratulations, Jurre! Abstract: This thesis introduces program-specific performance statistics as a Central Processing Unit (CPU) scheduling parameter within the context of the HotSniper chip architecture simulation toolchain. The parameter allows for a higher level of program-tailored scheduling, as opposed to the ubiquitous metrics such as types of latency and CPU utilization. Aug 28, 2023 The paper 'Lifetime Estimation for Core-Failure Resilient Multi-Core Processors' was accepted for IEEE MCSoC '23 Abstract: Multi-core processors come with several cores integrated on a single die. They often work incessantly under high thermal stress, leading to severe wear-out. Server-class multicores already come with a mechanism to survive a core failure called Core Failure Resilience (CFR). Sudam Wasala, Sobhan Niknam, Anuj Pathania, Clemens Grelck, Andy Pimentel Aug 10, 2023 The demo/tool 'ARM-CO-UP: ARM Co-Operative Utilization of Processors' was accepted for the Embedded Systems Software Competition at the IEEE/ACM Embedded Systems Week 2023. Abstract: Heterogeneous Multi-Processor System on Chips (HMPSoCs) combines different processors on a single chip. They enable powerful embedded devices, which increasingly perform Machine Learning (ML) inference at the edge. State-of-the-art HMPSoCs can perform on-chip embedded inference using their CPU, GPU, and integrated accelerators.
