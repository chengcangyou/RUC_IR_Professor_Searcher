He received his PhD from the Weizmann Institute of Science in 2009 and has been at Tel Aviv University since 2012. His research interest is in Software Engineering, specifically software and systems modeling, testing, formal specification languages, and synthesis. His work has been funded by an ERC Starting Grant (2015), an ERC Proof of Concept Grant (2022), an ISF Grant (2023), a BSF Grant (2025), and a DFG-ISF grant (2025). He spent sabbaticals in MIT CSAIL and in King's College London. He served as PC Co-Chair of ASE'22 main research track. Shahar co-organized the first International SPECS summer school in 2023 (SPECS23@TAU) and the second in 2025 (SPECS25@CMU). He co-organized a Dagstuhl Seminar on Specification Engineering in 2025. Shahar actively recruits new MSc students, PhD students, and post-docs. Positions come with full funding for a number of years. Please contact him for details.
