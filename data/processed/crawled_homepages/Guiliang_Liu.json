Should you be interested, please send me an email with you CV, transcript, and publications. Check the potential research topics in my research interest below. I have a joint appointment at Shenzhen Loop Area Institute (SLAI, a.k.a. \"Hetao\" Institute). If you would like to work with me at SLAI, please contact me. Research Interests Embodied Decision-Making (Our lab intro). My research focuses on the intersection of embodied intelligence and decision-making systems, particularly those driven by reinforcement learning algorithms. I am particularly interested in investigating decision-making in safety-critical scenarios, with the goal of developing robust and reliable control methods for various embodied agents. The decision-making process can be informed by diverse signals, such as expert demonstrations, human feedback, or social norms. Whole-body Control for Humanoid Robots; Generalist Robotic Manipulation System (a.k.a Vision-Language-Action, VLA); Generative Skill Acquisition from Simulation; Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF); For more details, please visit our Embodied Decision-Making (EdeM) Lab.
