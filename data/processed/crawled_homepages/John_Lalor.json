I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the College of Information and Computer Science. At UMass I was a member of the Bio-NLP group, working with Dr. Hong Yu. My research interests are in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I am particularly interested in model evaluation, quantifying uncertainty, and biomedical informatics. Prior to UMass, I worked as a software developer at Eze Software in Chicago and as an IT Audit Associate for KPMG. I received my Master’s Degree in Computer Science at DePaul University, where I worked on projects in Computer Science Education and Recommender Systems.
