I have filled the role of Scientific Advisor for different companies, including ABB (2019-2024) and Zero Point Technologies (2024-2025). I was a QUALIFICA Fellow (2023-2025) at the Institute for Software Technology and Software Engineering (ITIS) at the University of MÃ¡laga. My research focuses on the modeling and control of interconnected systems in the presence of uncertainty, as well as the application of control theory to the design and implementation of computing systems, particularly in the context of embedded and distributed systems. Prior to my current position, I worked as a Postdoctoral Research Assistant at the Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione at the Politecnico di Milano under the supervision of Maria Prandini. I was also a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Automatic Control at the Lund University, where I worked under the guidance of Karl-Erik Ã rzÃ©n. Additionally, I was also a member of Lund Center for Control of Complex Engineering Systems (LCCC). During my time as a PhD Fellow at the Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione at Politecnico di Milano, I focused on advanced model simplification techniques for continuous and discontinuous systems. I had the privilege of being mentored by Alberto Leva. If youâre interested, you can access my PhD thesis here. With my extensive academic background and expertise in complex real-time embedded systems, I am dedicated to advancing the field through innovative research and educating the next generation of engineers.
