PhD, Aarhus University, 2006 (genealogy). I was in 2007 at The University of Chicago for 1 year, funded by a Villum Kann Rasmussen postdoc fellowship, and in 2008-2009 at Aarhus University in a postdoc position for 2 years, funded by The Carlsberg Foundation. My main research interests are computational complexity theory (in particular Boolean circuit complexity) and algorithmic game theory. Additional interests include algorithms in general.
