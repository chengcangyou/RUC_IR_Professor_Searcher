I am looking for PostDoc/Ph.D./RA/Intern students to join my group. If you’re interested, please drop me an email (shaohuali.cuhk@gmail.com) with your CV. See Openings for more details. I recently obtained my Ph.D. at the AST Lab at ETH Zurich, advised by Zhendong Su. Previously, I got both my Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). News [Sep, 2025] One paper got accepted to DL4C@Neurips 2025🥳 [Aug, 2025] Two papers got accepted to OOPSLA 2025🥳 [May, 2025] I will serve the OOPSLA 2026 as a PC member. [Feb, 2025] Our SAND from ICSE 2025 has been upstreamed to AFL++ 🥳 6a4b580 [Jan, 2025] Our paper on decoupling sanitization from fuzzing loop is accepted to ICSE 2025. Research Interests I’m broadly interested in topics related to compilers, software engineering, and security. In particular, I’m interested in the reliability and security of critical software systems, especially compilers. Well…finally, AI. I’m recently thinking about how to solve classic PL/SE/Security problems using AI. On the other hand, since AI models are still working as software/programs, they may also suffer from classic PL/SE/Security problems.
