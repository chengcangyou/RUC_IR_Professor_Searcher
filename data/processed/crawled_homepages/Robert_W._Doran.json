I am now retired and am regarded as a Professor Emeritus, but I continue to work in the department as a tutor. I have also worked in the past at City University London, Massey University, and at  Amdahl Corporation, California (as computer architect). My computing interests are in computer architecture, history of computing, parallel algorithms and programming. But I also have many interests other than work. For further information.
