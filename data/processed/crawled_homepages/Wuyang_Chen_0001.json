Previously, Dr. Chen was a postdoc researcher in Statistics at the University of California, Berkeley, worked with Professor Michael Mahoney. He obtained his Ph.D. from the ECE Department at UT Austin in 2023, under the supervision of Professor Atlas Wang. Dr. Chen's research focuses on the theoretical understanding of deep learning, with applications in foundation models, AutoML, computer vision, natural language processing, and addressing scientific problems. His work also encompasses domain adaptation/generalization and self-supervised learning. He published papers on CVPR, ECCV, ICLR, ICML, Neurips, etc. Dr. Chen's work on training-free neural architecture design was highlighted as the \"Featured Advances in Artificial Intelligence\" in the National Science Foundation (NSF) newsletter in 2022. Dr. Chen co-organized the 4th and 5th versions of UG2+ workshop and challenge in CVPR 2021 and 2022. He also holds a position on the board of the One World Seminar Series on the Mathematics of Machine Learning. wuyang AT sfu.ca This website may not actively updated (last update: 4/28/2024). Please visit our group page -> DeLTA Lab Research:Theory-accelerated AI, with Implications for Scientific Problems [Core Method] Theory-accelerated AI We are dedicated to examining key aspects of Deep Learning, including data, model architectures (trainability/expressivity/generalization), and training dynamics. This systematic analysis aims to expedite the AI development pipeline by optimizing data quality, model design/scaling, and training recipe in a zero-shot manner. [Core Application] AI-for-Science Our methodologies, guided by theoretical principles, aim to expedite scientific discovery, with a specific focus on the human genome and scientific machine learning. In addition to the core aims mentioned above, we are also interested in a broad range of topics, including computer vision, natural language processing, model efficiency, automated machine learning (AutoML), self-supervised learning, and domain generalization.
