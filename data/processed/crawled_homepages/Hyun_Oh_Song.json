Previously, I was a research scientist at Google Research, in Mountain View, where I worked on machine learning research in Kevin Murphy's team. Before Google, I was a postdoctoral fellow in SAIL in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at UC Berkeley in 2014, where I worked with Trevor Darrell and Stefanie Jegelka. My graduate study was fully supported by Samsung Lee Kun Hee Scholarship Foundation for five years. In summer 2013, I spent time at LEAR, INRIA as a visiting student researcher. I did my B.S. at Hanyang University. My research interests are in machine learning, combinatorial optimization, and algorithms. Broadly, I'm interested in solving challenging combinatorial problems in artificial intelligence. Email  /  Google Scholar  / Github (mllab)  / Github (personal) / LinkedIn News I founded an AI health care startup, DeepMetrics. We are actively hiring! I'm serving as an Area chair at NeurIPS 2021~2025, ICML 2023~2025, and a Senior program committee member at AAAI 2022. I gave an invited talk at Samsung AI Forum 2022 on learning with combinatorial structures. Tensorflow code for the suite of deep metric learning methods I worked on at Google is officially open sourced at TensorFlow Addons. I moved to Seoul National University as an assistant professor starting Sep 2017. I had joined Google Research as a research scientist starting July, 2016. For prospective students For undergrads at SNU, you should take my deep learning class (M2177.0043) and machine learning class (4190.666). For math & stat, I recommend you to take these classes: 300.203A (881.007), M1407.000600 (881.008), 881.319, 326.211, 326.311, 3341.454. For CS, please take: M1522.0009, 4190.407. It's best to first apply for undergraduate internship. Please contact (via email) at least one semester before your graduate application for the internship.
