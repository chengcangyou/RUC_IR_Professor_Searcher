Courses numbered 4xx and below are undergraduate. A note to UBC students: as of the last time I checked, you could count up to two courses from the other category toward your degree (eg grad courses for undergraduates, ugrad courses for grad students). Check with your advisor and the instructor for permission. I am generally quite happy to have students take courses at either level. I try to keep the graduate course links live, but the undergraduate course links for older courses may point to more recent offerings. 2023-2024: Spring: CPSC 103 Fall: CPSC 203 2022-2023: Spring: None Fall: None 2021-2022: Spring: None Fall: None 2020-2021: Spring: None Fall: CPSC 515 Computational Robotics.

This is a brand new course for this year, and is designed for students from outside Computer Science. Fall: CPSC 513 Integrated Systems Design: Introduction to Formal Verification. 2008-2009: Spring: CPSC 303 Numerical Approximation and Discretization (in WebCT Vista). Although I would prefer to make most of the website publicly visible, because of Vista's limitations you will not be able to access the website unless you are registered for the course. If you would like to get an idea about what the course will cover without registering, you can look at the 2007-2008 web page, which had very similar material.

Fall: None. 2005-2006: Spring: CPSC 303 Numerical Approximation and Discretization. Offered annually. Fall: CPSC 513 Integrated Systems Design: Introduction to Formal Verification. This course is significantly different than previous years' CPSC 513 offerings (by Alan Hu). A similarly broad version of this course will be offered by Alan Hu in Spring 2007. 2004-2005: Spring: CPSC 403 Numerical Solution of Ordinary Differential Equations. As of 7/2006, this course is not scheduled to be taught again. Fall: CPSC 542D Topics in Numerical Computation: Level Set Methods: Dynamic Implicit Surfaces and the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation. This course will be offered again in 2006-2007. 2003-2004: Fall: CPSC 538A Topics in Computer Systems: Computational Techniques for Hybrid and Embedded Systems Design. As of 7/2006, I do not plan to offer this course again. Reproducible Research The talk \"Code != Data: Why reproducible research needs both but should not treat them the same\" was given at the Special Libraries Association Annual Conference on June 9, 2014 in a session organized by Carol Hutchins (NYU Courant Institute) called \"Reproducible Research: A Path for Boosting Science in the 21st Century\". I ran an optional repeatability evaluation process for the 2014 edition of the Hybrid Systems Computation and Control (HSCC) conference. The HSCC 2014 Repeatability Evaluation website explains all the details of the process. Do you want to propose a similar procedure in your favorite conference? Take a look at my original proposal to the HSCC steering committee. HSCC 2015 did not have a repeatability evaluation due to a family medical issue. I am planning to repeat it for HSCC 2016. The workshop Reproducible Research: Tools & Strategies for Scientific Computing was held July 13-15, 2011 at UBC in coordination with the Applied Mathematics Perspectives series of ICIAM 2011 satellite meetings. The talks were recorded and are available as streaming videos (the current format requires Silverlight; let me know if you require a different format). Computing in Science and Engineering, volume 14, issue 4 (July-August 2012) is a special issue with seven papers based on the workshop. PhD Comics has an excellent video \"Open Access Explained\" covering the concepts and motivation behind the open access movement, of which reproducible research is a part. Research My research agenda includes: Algorithms for designing and analyzing hybrid and embedded systems. Level set algorithms for time-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations (PDEs). Single pass (FMM, OUM) and sweeping algorithms for static Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs. High quality, publically released implementations of these algorithms. Application of these algorithms to path planning for autonomous and semi-autonomous systems. For those interested in experimenting with Level Set Methods for solving time-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs, such as those that arise in dynamic implicit surfaces and reachability, I have released: A Toolbox of Level Set Methods I do not yet have any public code for direct approximation of static (time-independent) Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs, such as those that arise in robotic path planning. However, here are some slides discussing the relationship between path planning and Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs, various classes of algorithms for approximating the resulting PDEs, and a few extensions on which I have worked: Dynamic Programming Algorithms for Planning and Robotics in Continuous Domains and the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation. These slides were presented at the Fast Marching Method: Theoretical Underpinnings and Applications to Robotics tutorial at IROS 2008. Selected publications: Many of my academic publications are available online. Where permitted by the publishers, I have provided links to self-archived post-prints (if I have one) as well as the published versions (the latter usually require subscriptions). If the paper you want is not hyperlinked or if you are unable to access the publisher's web site, please email me and I may be able to provide a copy by other means. 2017 \"Data Logger Technologies for Powered Wheelchairs: A Scoping Review\" François Routhier, Josiane Lettre, William C.
