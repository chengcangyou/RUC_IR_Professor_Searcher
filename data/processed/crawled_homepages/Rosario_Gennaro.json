My research focuses on cryptography and network security and more in general on theoretical computer science. My most recent works address the security of the cloud computing infrastructure, the issues of privacy and anonymity in electronic communication, and proactive security to minimize the effects of system break-ins. Education Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, MIT, 1996. M.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, MIT, 1993. Laurea in Matematica, Universita' di Catania, Italy, 1989.
