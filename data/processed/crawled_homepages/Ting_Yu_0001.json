On the one hand, he investigates how advanced AI capabilities can help solve some of the hardest problems in cyber security, including intrusion detection, malware analysis, software vulnerability detection and automated fixing, and threat intelligence extraction and sharing. On the other hand, we investigate the security and privacy issues of AI solutions, especially when they are applied in systems beyond traditional domains. Email Share Prior to joining MBZUAI, Professor Yu was a researcher at the Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI) and served as the research director of cyber security, leading a team of scientists, engineers and research associates to develop novel technologies to enhance the security of critical infrastructures. Prior to that, from 2003 to 2013, he was a faculty member at North Carolina State University. Professor Yu has published more than 100 research papers and more than 10 patents in the area of cyber security and data privacy. He previously served on the editorial boards of the ACM Transactions of Privacy and Security (TOPS) and the IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Systems (TDSC), and on the technical program committees of numerous security and databases conferences.
