Her research centres around the exploration of statistical models in representing uncertainty and the benefit they bring over earlier work in a wide range of application areas, particularly the integration of machine learning and natural language processing for text understanding. She currently holds a five-year Turing AI Fellowship, funded by the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). Yulan obtained her PhD degree in spoken language understanding from the University of Cambridge, and her MEng and BASc (First Class Honours) degrees in Computer Engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. Research interests Event-centric NLU - Natural language understanding built on event representation of text. Question-Answering - Machine reading comprehension; event-centric QA. Model interpretability - Interpreting neural model decisions. Sentiment analysis and opinion mining - Understanding sentiment and opinions expressed in text. Claim veracity assessment - Fact checking; multimodal fake news detection; Twitter rumour veracity assessment. Topic discovery in text - Extracting topics, perspectives, viewpoints from text such as news, microblogs, and reviews. NLP for health and finance - NLP technologies applied to the health and finance domains.
