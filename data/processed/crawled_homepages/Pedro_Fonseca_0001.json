He makes systems reliable and secure, and targets core software systems – the building blocks in modern computing that other software critically relies upon, such as operating systems, hypervisors, and distributed systems. He is the recipient of a NSF CAREER award, a Google Faculty Research award, and a Google Research Scholar award. Before joining Purdue, he was a postdoc at the University of Washington, where he worked with Arvind Krishnamurthy, Hank Levy, and Xi Wang. He graduated from MPI-SWS and the University of Saarland, where he worked with Rodrigo Rodrigues. I am looking for talented, highly motivated PhD students to join my lab! Prospective students should email me and explain their research interests and how they relate to my work.
