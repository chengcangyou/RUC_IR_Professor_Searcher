I am also affiliated to PLSE@NUS. I obtained my PhD from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I was fortunate to be advised by the amazing Prof. Mahesh Viswanathan. Prior to joining NUS, I was a Research Scientist at Facebook Inc. and a Research Fellow at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing. My PhD was supported, in part, by a Google PhD Fellowship. I am broadly interested in Formal Methods and Logic and their applications to Programming Languages, Software Engineering and Computer Systems. My current research primarily focuses on developing algorithmic techniques for analysis of concurrent software [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] , and, understanding the decidability and complexity horizon in the context of verification [19, 20, 21], synthesis [22], formal logic [23] and automata [24]. Open Positions I have several openings for Postdoc researchers, PhD students and masters students as well as undergraduate students interested in pursuing research. Please reach out to me if you are interested in working with me on topics in Formal Methods and Programming Languages, Software Engineering and their intersection with Logic and Automata Theory.
