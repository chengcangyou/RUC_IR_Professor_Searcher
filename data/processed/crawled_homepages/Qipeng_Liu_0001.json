Please see [HERE] to learn more about my research.I am Qipeng (Kevin) Liu. I am an Assistant Professor @ UC San Diego, CSE. I was a Simons Quantum Postdoctoral Fellow at Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, hosted by Shafi Goldwasser and Umesh Vazirani. I earned my Ph.D. at Princeton University in 2021, where I was very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Mark Zhandry. I have a broad interest in theoretical computer science. I focus on quantum computing, quantum information and cryptography in a quantum world. This includes analyzing and understanding quantum query complexity and thus post-quantum security of  existing cryptosystems;building cryptography with the power of quantum information and quantum computers. Email0: qipengliu [AT] ucsd [D] eduEmail1: qipengliu0 [AT] gmail [D] com    (There is a ZERO at the end of the email address)Email2: obfustopia [AT] gmail [D] com Qipeng Liu刘启鹏A good (70%) approximation of my name pronunciation is ``Chi-Pen Leo''.My first name starts with QIP (quantum information processing).My Erdős number is 3: me -- Erik D.
