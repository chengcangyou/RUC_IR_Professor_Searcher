From November 2017 until October 2018, I was a postdoc at IRIF, Université Paris-Diderot, funded by a fellowship of the Fondation Sciences Mathématiques de Paris and hosted by Olivier Serre. From November 2015 until October 2017, I was a postdoc at the LSV Cachan, funded by a fellowship of the DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service), hosted by Philippe Schnoebelen, and the project VERICONISS by Stefan Göller. Before that, I obtained a PhD with Prof. Dr. Roland Meyer in the Concurrency Theory Group in Kaiserslautern. I defended my dissertation on June 19th, 2015. Until December 2010, I studied Computer Science (with a minor in Mathematics) at Universität Hamburg. My research is concerned with theoretical foundations of verification and synthesis of software systems. More specifically, I am interested in decidability and complexity issues of infinite-state systems. One current focus is synthesis of finite-state abstractions of infinite-state systems (separability problems, downward closures, Parikh images), which can be used as correctness certificates or as building blocks for decision procedures. In addition, I am working on decision problems for infinite groups, where I seek to apply methods from verification and gain insights on how to devise infinite-state models with pleasant analysis properties.

A language $L$ is \\emph{directed} if every pair of words in $L$ have a common (scattered) superword in $L$. Deciding directedness is a fundamental problem in connection with ideal decompositions of downward closed sets. % A language $L$ is directed if and only if the ideal %decomposition of $L$'s downward closure consists of exactly one ideal. Another motivation is that deciding whether two \\emph{directed} context-free languages have the same downward closures can be decided in polynomial time, whereas for general context-free languages, this problem is known to be $\\coNEXP$-complete. We show that the directedness problem for regular languages, given as NFAs, belongs to $\\AC^1$, and thus polynomial time. Moreover, it is $\\NL$-complete for fixed alphabet sizes. Furthermore, we show that for context-free languages, the directedness problem is $\\PSPACE$-complete. @INPROCEEDINGS{GanardiSaglamZetzsche2024a, AUTHOR\t\t= {Ganardi, Moses and Salam, Irmak and Zetzsche, Georg}, TITLE\t\t= {Directed Regular and Context-Free Languages}, BOOKTITLE\t= {Proc. of the 41st International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science (STACS 2024)}, YEAR\t\t= {2024}, SERIES\t\t= {LIPIcs}, VOLUME\t\t= {289}, PUBLISHER\t= {Schloss Dagstuhl--Leibniz-Zentrum f{\\\"u}r Informatik}, ADDRESS\t= {Dagstuhl, Germany}, PAGES\t\t= {36:1--36:20}, DOI\t\t= {10.4230/LIPICS.STACS.2024.36} } Reachability in Continuous Pushdown VASS with A. R. Balasubramanian, Rupak Majumdar, and Ramanathan S. Thinniyam Proceedings of POPL 2024 [ Show BibTeX Hide BibTeX | Show abstract Hide abstract | arXiv | DOI ] [ BibTeX | arXiv | DOI ] Abstract Pushdown Vector Addition Systems with States (PVASS) consist of finitely many control states, a pushdown stack, and a set of counters that can be incremented and decremented, but not tested for zero. Whether the reachability problem is decidable for PVASS is a long-standing open problem. We consider continuous PVASS, which are PVASS with a continuous semantics. This means, the counter values are rational numbers and whenever a vector is added to the current counter values, this vector is first scaled with an arbitrarily chosen rational factor between zero and one. We show that reachability in continuous PVASS is NEXPTIME-complete. Our result is unusually robust: Reachability can be decided in NEXPTIME even if all numbers are specified in binary. On the other hand, NEXPTIME-hardness already holds for coverability, in fixed dimension, for bounded stack, and even if all numbers are specified in unary. @INPROCEEDINGS{BalasubramanianMajumdarThinniyamZetzsche2024a, AUTHOR\t\t= {Balasubramanian, A.
