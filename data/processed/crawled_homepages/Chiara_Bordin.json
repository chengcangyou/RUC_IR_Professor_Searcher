Her main research interests are related to mathematical optimization in the context of computer science applied to smart energy and power systems. This refers in particular (but is not limited) to: models for storage integration and storage technologies assessment; strategic network design, expansion and operation; power systems reliability-oriented network restructuring and reconfiguration; multi-agent systems for microgrids coordination; stochastic multihorizon optimization; optimal management of electric vehicles and charging sites; integration of machine learning methodologies in the context of mathematical modelling. Mathematical modelling and optimization is a strong interdisciplinary and versatile subject. By combining it with computer science, power systems engineering, economics, big data analytics and machine learning, it is possible to address many research questions within the energy and power systems field, enhance analyses and look at the studied systems from different perspectives. This can provide key methodological and analytical contributions to the young and dynamic research area of Energy Informatics, with particular regard to the two major research themes of “smart energy-saving systems” and “smart grids”. Energy Informatics is an interdisciplinary field that combines engineering, mathematics, computer science, energy economics, power systems, and energy systems. Energy informatics researches ways to more efficiently manage fossil and renewable energy resources using information and communication technology. Smart grids, smart meters, demand response, smart buildings, plug-in electric vehicles, energy storage, energy policy, energy markets, and market processes, as well as issues like smart energy and power system modeling and green computing, are all included in the field of energy informatics. The two main goals of Energy Informatics are energy efficiency and renewable energy supply. Within the broad Energy Informatics domain, the \"Smart Energy and Power Systems Modelling\" discipline has a key role. It focuses on the optimal design, expansion, management, and operation of energy and power systems, by including elements such as renewable sources, storage technologies, electric vehicles, smart grids, and smart buildings, as well as social aspects such as nudging and demand response. It is therefore a key subject to provide a holistic understanding of the Energy and power systems issues.
