Before joining NTU, I was the Fernbach Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where I worked with Dr. Kathryn Mohror. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, under the guidance of Prof. Marc Snir. Fun fact: I have an Erdős number of 3 through Marc :).My research interests include high-performance computing, storage system, system for AI/LLM, parallel file system, performance analysis, etc. During my Ph.D. and postdoctoral research, I have extensively studied performance issues related to POSIX consistency and explored the design of next-generation high-performance storage systems. Many of the projects I have been involved in are centered around these areas.TeachingNTU Undergrads: We’ve just relaunched the Parallel Computing course (SC4050). If you’re interested in high-performance computing (such as OpenMP, MPI, parallel file systems), consider enrolling.In addition, I will be offering a new GPU-focused course (SC4064) starting in Spring 2026. This course will cover fundamental GPU architecture and programming concepts, along with emerging topics such as sparse tensor cores, container-based AI deployment, heterogeneous computing, and more.HiringI am actively looking for self-motivated students. If you’re interested in working with me, please check out this page for more details.News!Nov 2025 - Our PDC paper “Data Management in the Continuum: Cross-facility Object-based Data Transfers” received the Recognition Award at SBAC-PAD 2025! Find more about PDC here.Sep 2025 - I will give a keynote talk at the 2026 HPC Users Symposium orgnized by NSCC Singapore. Registration is free. Venue: Sep. 25, 2025, Orchard Hotel Singapore.Aug 2025 - Our SmartIO paper is accpeted by PDSW'25 assoicated with SC.Aug 2025 - Our PDC work is accpeted by SBAC-PAD.Apr 2025 – Two short papers accepted by SSDBM'25! See you in Columbus, OH.Apr 2025 – Recognized as a 2024 Outstanding Reviewer for the Future Generation Computer Systems (FGCS) Journal.Mar 2025 – Awarded a Director’s Discretionary Allocation, granting 3,000 node hours on two GPU-based supercomputers at Argonne National Lab.Feb 2025 – Our Dagstuhl Seminar proposal has been accepted! Titled Storage Systems and I/O for Emerging Workloads on HPC Systems, the seminar will take place at Schloss Dagstuhl in Wadern, Germany, from Jan 11 to 16, 2026. More details here.Feb 2025 – Our work on scaling E3SM across multiple flagship supercomputers has been shortlisted for the CCGRID’25 SCALE Challenge. We will present in Tromso, Norway and compete for the grand prize.Jan 2025 – Our paper on verifying parallel I/O semantics adherence has been accepted at IPDPS’25! The project (named VerifyIO) is publicly available here, along with reproducibility documentation. I will present in Milan, Italy. Additionally, I will co-organize the ESSA’25 workshop at IPDPS'25.
