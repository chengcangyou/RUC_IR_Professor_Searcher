Please visit our lab homepage for more information.AboutSeulki Lee is an associate professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) and Artificial Intelligence Graduate School (AIGS) at UNIST (Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology), where he leads EAI Lab (Embedded Artificial Intelligence Lab). He earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science at the Department of Computer Science, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), advised by Dr. Shahriar Nirjon. His research aims to make resource-constrained real-time and embedded sensing systems capable of learning, adapting, and evolving, which facilitates Embedded Artificial Intelligence (Embedded AI). Prior to starting his Ph.D., he designed sensor system architecture and intelligent sensing algorithms for smartphones at Samsung Electronics. He spent two summers as a research intern at Nokia Bell Labs and Mercedes-Benz Research & Development North America, where he researched machine learning and future transportation systems.Research InterestsEmbedded Artificial Intelligence (Embedded AI)On-device machine learning on embedded/mobile/IoT devicesEmbedded Computer Vision, Embedded NLP, Embedded Reinforcement LearningEfficient model (deep learning) inference, training, and adaptationCollaborative and Collective Learning SystemsPervasive- and always-learning on connected systemsScalable and autonomous intelligence on networked systems (AIoT, AIoE, and intelligent edge)Mobile computing and sensor data analyticsCyber-Physical SystemsControl theoryMobile robots and smart sensing systemsNewsNov 2025: WACV 2026 paper acceptedSep 2025: NeurIPS 2025 paper acceptedSep 2025: IJCV paper acceptedAug 2025: CIKM 2025 paper acceptedJul 2025: ICML 2025 Outstanding Position Paper AwardMay 2025: Distinguished TPC member award (SenSys 2025)May 2025: Two ICML 2025 papers acceptedMar 2025: OSDI 2025 paper acceptedJan 2025: ICLR 2025 paper acceptedDec 2024: AAAI 2025 paper acceptedDec 2024: ACCV 2024 paper got Best Application Paper AwardSep 2024: ACCV 2024 paper acceptedMay 2024: KDD 2024 paper acceptedJan 2024: AISTATS 2024 paper acceptedNov 2023: Invited talk at AICON Gwangju 2023, KoreaSep 2023: NeurIPS 2023 paper acceptedSep 2023: SenSys 2023 paper acceptedMay 2023: IPSN 2023 paper (MicroDeblur) got Best Paper Runner Up AwardApr 2023: IEEE Internet of Things Journal paper acceptedFeb 2023: IPSN 2023 paper acceptedJan 2023: Invited talk (Tutorial) at ICOIN 2023, ThailandJun 2022: Invited talk at KCC 2022, Korea Feb 2022: Invited talk at KIISE Computer System Society 2022, KoreaDec 2021: PerCom 2022 paper acceptedAug 2021: Invited talk at ETRI, KoreaJun 2021: Invited talk at ETRI, KoreaMay 2021: Doctoral degree (Ph.D.) in Computer Science awardedJan 2021: IPSN 2021 paper acceptedNov 2020: Invited talk at UNIST, KoreaNov 2020: Invited talk at DGIST, KoreaOct 2020: AIChallengeIoT 2020 paper accepted (Best Paper Award)Oct 2020: Invited talk at GIST, KoreaAug 2020: Invited talk at Yonsei University, KoreaJun 2020: Invited talk at Stony Brook UniversityMar 2020: MobiSys 2020 paper acceptedDec 2019: RTAS 2020 paper acceptedNov 2019: Served as a program committee for SenSys 2019 poster/demoOct 2019: IMWUT 2019 (UbiComp 2020/ISWC 2020) paper accepted (Best Presentation Award)Sep 2019: NSF student travel grant (SenSys 2019)Jul 2019: SenSys 2019 paper acceptedMar 2019: RTAS 2019 work in progress paper acceptedFeb 2019: IPSN 2019 poster acceptedDec 2018: Masters of Computer Science degree awardedJun 2018: Summer internship at Nokia Bell LabsMar 2018: DCOSS 2018 paper acceptedJun 2017: Summer internship at Mercedes-Benz Research & Development North AmericaExperienceAssociate Professor: UNIST (Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology), Ulsan, Korea, 2025 -
