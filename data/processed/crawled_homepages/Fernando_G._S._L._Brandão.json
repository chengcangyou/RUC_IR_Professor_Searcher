BrandÃ£oHead of Quantum AlgorithmsAmazon Web ServicesBren Professor of Theoretical PhysicsCalifornia Institute of TechnologyE-mails: fbrandao@caltech.eduÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  fbrandao@amazon.comÂ About me: I amÂ the head of quantum algorithms atÂ Amazon Web ServicesÂ Â and a professor of theoretical physics atÂ CaltechÂ division ofÂ Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy.Previously I was visiting facultyÂ atÂ Googleâs Quantum AIÂ LabÂ (2018-2019), a researcher at MicrosoftÂ (2015-2016) and a reader in computer science at University College London (2013-2016). Before that I was a senior researcher at ETH (2012), after being an assistant professor of physics at UFMG (2011-2012).Â I hold a PhD fromÂ Imperial College LondonÂ Â (2008), and was a postdoctoral fellow atÂ Imperial College LondonÂ (2008-2010) and UFMG (2010-2011).Â [cv, google scholar]Research: Â My research is on quantum information science. I explorethe interplay of physics,Â computer science and math to study the role ofquantum mechanics in computation and information processing.Selected Publications:Quantum Supremacy Using a Programmable Superconducting ProcessorDetermining Eigenstates on a Q.
