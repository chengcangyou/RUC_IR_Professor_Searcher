Jerry received his Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University in 2005. His research interests are in machine learning, particularly optimal teaching, sequential decision making, and learning in game theory. He currently serves or has served as conference chair for AISTATS and CogSci, position paper track chair for ICML, action editor of the Machine Learning Journal, and a member of the DARPA ISAT advisory group. He is a recipient of an NSF CAREER Award and a winner of multiple best paper awards, including an ICML classic paper prize. I am looking for PhD students generally interested in learning theory and game theory.
