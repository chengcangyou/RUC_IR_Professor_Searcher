I'm interested in how people integrate diverse types of knowledge, from document collections to the work of people with different kinds of expertise.  I study interdisciplinary scientific collaborations, social Q&A communities and informal educational resources (for details, see my Research page).  If you're interested in any of these projects or programs, feel free to contact me. © Rich Gazan | 2550 McCarthy Mall, Hamilton Library 002, Honolulu, HI 96822 | gazan (at) hawaii (dot) edu Photo: Leah Gazan | Template design by andreasviklund.com.",
