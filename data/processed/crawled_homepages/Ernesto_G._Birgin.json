G. Birgin and J. M. Martínez, Practical Augmented Lagrangian Methods for Constrained Optimization, Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Philadelphia, 2014. [DOI: 10.1137/1.9781611973365] This book focuses on Augmented Lagrangian techniques for solving practical constrained optimization problems. The authors rigorously delineate mathematical convergence theory based on sequential optimality conditions and novel constraint qualifications; orient the book to practitioners by giving priority to results that provide insight on the practical behavior of algorithms and by providing geometrical and algorithmic interpretations of every mathematical result; and fully describe a freely available computational package for constrained optimization and illustrate its usefulness with applications. Audience: This book is aimed at engineers, physicists, chemists, and other practitioners interested in full access to comprehensive and well-documented software for large-scale optimization as well as up-to-date convergence theory and its practical consequences. It will also be of interest to graduate and advanced undergraduate students in mathematics, computer science, applied mathematics, optimization, and numerical analysis.
