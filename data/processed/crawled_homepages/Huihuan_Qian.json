Eng. (2004) in Automation from University of Science and Technology of China. Thereafter, he joined the Department of Automation and Computer-Aided Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong as a Research Assistant (2004-2005), and received his Ph.D. (2010) in Automation and Computer-Aided Engineering. He worked in the Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering at the same university as a Research Associate (2010-2012) after graduation, and as a Research Assistant Professor (2012-2015) before he joined the School of Science and Engineering in the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. He serves as Associate Director of State Joint Engineering Laboratory on Robotics and Intelligent Manufacturing.Dr. Qian has published 2 monographs, 1 edited book, and 140 papers in international journal and conferences, and awarded over 35 patents. As PI, he has completed an NSFC Key project and 2 other projects funded by Hong Kong SAR Governments. He has also completed over 10 projects in Hong Kong SAR and Mainland China as Co-I or key member. He has received the Best Transaction Paper Award from IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics in 2011 with his colleagues, based on the research of steering interface for omni-directional vehicles. With his postgraduate/undergraduate students, he has received a number of awards recently, including IROS2020 Best Application Paper Finalist, ROBIO2019 Best Paper Finalist, RCAR2019 Best Paper Finalist, and WCICA2018 Best Student Paper Finalist. He has served as Deputy Editor-in-Chief in Special Issue on Intelligent Robots, Frontiers of Information Technology & Electronic Engineering, and Area Chair in Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS). He is now Associate Editor in IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), and IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS). He serves as Vice Chair at Guangzhou Section Chapter for IEEE Robotics and Automation Society, and Member at Expert Committee in Promotion Society for Construction of Global Ocean City of Shenzhen.His research interests include robotics and intelligent systems, especially with recent focus on marine robotics.
