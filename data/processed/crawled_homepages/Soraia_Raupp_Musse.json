I finished my BSc Course in Computer Science at PUCRS in December 1989, and the MSc in Computer Science at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (all in portuguese), in July 1994. Both courses were undertaken in Porto Alegre, Brazil. I got my PhD degree at Swiss Federal institute of Technology (Switzerland) - VRLab, under supervision of Prof. Daniel Thalmann, where I worked mainly with Crowd Simulation and virtual humans. More recently, I spent a year (from July2015 to July2016) for my sabbatical at UPENN working with Prof. Norman Badler, where I worked mainly with crowd simulation. In 2022, I received the prestigious \"Google Research in Computer Science\" award, as acknowledged by Google's Outreach Program. And, in 2024, I was honored as the \"Outstanding Researcher\" at SBGames 2024, recognizing my contributions to the field of computer science and digital games research. SBGames 2024. People at VHLab I supervise Undergraduate, Master, PhD, and Postdoc researchers. Interested?
