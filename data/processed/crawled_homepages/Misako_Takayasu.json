Top From the beginning of this century, with smartphones and the internet permeating almost all aspects of human life, our society has experienced the important turning point known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Among industries and government offices, several institutions are intensely using the so-called Big Data that has been accumulated along the years in order to solve the various problems confronted by our society and help to create a wealthy, secure and safe way of living. This research unit, together with a Big Data analysis center equipped with advanced security technology, forms an international research center for Advanced Data Analysis and Modeling. Keeping an interdisciplinary perspective and by performing data analysis, time-spatial modeling and large-scale simulations, we search for scientifically based solutions for many problems of the country and corporations. â Unit Intruductionâ PUCK Tool Demo Outline of PUCK (Under Construction) PUCK Tool Demo (Under Construction) Collaborative Research Programs â Collaborative Research Program with Sony (April 2023-March 2025) â Center for TDB Advanced Data Analysis and Modeling (Novemver 2014-March 2023) â Collaborative Research Program with MUFG Bank (April 2018-March 2020) Conference Information APEC -SSS 2016, August, 24-26, 2016(Big Data Analysis and Modeling toward Super Smart Society) SMSEC2014, November 4-6, 2014(Social Modeling and Simulations + Econophysics Colloquium) APFA7, March 1-5, 2009(Applications of Physics in Financial Analysis) News",
