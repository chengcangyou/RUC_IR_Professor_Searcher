His research centers on strengthening software and system security in the presence of vulnerabilities. His broader interests include fuzzing and robust sanitization to uncover and address flaws, developing effective mitigations to protect against unknown or unpatched vulnerabilities, analyzing software bugs to assess exploitability, and employing fault isolation techniques to enforce privilege separation. He combines binary analysis with compiler-based approaches and maintains a strong commitment to open-source prototypes. Mathias joined EPFL in 2018 and received tenure in 2021. Prior to this, he was an assistant professor at Purdue University for four years and a postdoctoral researcher with Dawn Song at UC Berkeley for two years. He earned his Doctorate of Science (Dr. sc. ETH) in 2012 from ETH Zurich. In addition to his academic contributions, Mathias co-founded the EPFL polygl0ts CTF team in 2018 and founded the Purdue b01lers CTF team in 2014 to foster collaborative cybersecurity innovation. Check out his blog on random ramblings on security-related topics, our group home page, the overview of the systems circus, and our teaching page. His Curriculum Vitae is available as well. Contact and Social Address: BC 160, Station 14, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland. Interested in joining the HexHive research group? Follow the advice for prospective students/interns.
