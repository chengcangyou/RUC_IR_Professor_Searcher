My research is focused on computational fabrication, with a particular interest in low-level computer representations that advance our understanding of real world phenomenon. Or for a more concrete example, I did my thesis on formalizing knit object equivalence using knot theory.I am looking for students. If you're interested in graphics, textiles, and/or weird math, please reach out by email! Before this, I was a postdoctoral scholar with Cem Yuksel at the University of Utah. I received my PhD in 2024 from Carnegie Mellon University's Computer Science Department, where I was advised by James McCann. Prior to that I got my B.E. in Computer Science and Molecular Biology at MIT.

I served as TA for CMU's Computational Photography class in Fall of 2020 and 2021. In addition to running office hours and grading assignments, I converted existing course assignments from MATLAB to Python. I've also been a guest lecturer for the Algorithm Textiles course at CMU (2019 & 2021) and the E-Textiles course at University of Washington (2021), where I taught students how to write transfer plans for machine knitting programs. I also co-ran the University of Utah's Graphics Seminar (CS 7933) in Spring 2025. Service In Spring 2020 I taught a class on wallpaper groups for TechNights, a CMU program aimed at introducing STEM concepts to middle school girls. Furthermore, I've co-run Knitout Office Hours (KOOH) since Fall of 2018, where the Textiles Lab provides knitting machine access and instruction to the greater CMU community. If you're interested in learning to machine knit, email James McCann for information about current hours. From 2019-2022 I served as a chair on the organizing committee for SIGBOVIK, a serious conference about 100% serious computer science adjacent research where many young researchers get their first taste of academic writing (actually serious). Notably, I made SIGBOVIK 2019's website, which was voted website of the year by at least one person that was not me.",
