Despite this, few recommender systems research papers address their environmental impact. In this study, we estimate the environmental impact of recommender systems research by reproducing typical experimental pipelines. Our analysis spans 79 full papers from the 2013 and 2023 ACM RecSys conferences, comparing traditional “good old-fashioned AI’’ algorithms with modern deep learning algorithms. We designed and reproduced representative experimental pipelines for both years, measuring energy consumption with a hardware energy meter and converting it to CO2 equivalents. Our result",
