Causal Representation Learning for Decision Support Systems2. End-To-End Sign Language Translation into spoken language 20162025 Research activity per year Personal profile Research FocusMy primary research focus centers on the convergence of Natural Language Processing (NLP), e-health, and machine learning, with a specific emphasis on innovative approaches to enhance language understanding, develop explainable e-health applications and address challenges with a societal impact.Research InterestsNatural Language Processing (NLP), Data Mining, e-Health and Machine Learning Research StatementI earned my doctorate degree from the GREYC Laboratory, a joint collaboration between the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), Ecole Nationale Supérieure d'Ingénieurs de Caen (ENSICAEN) and University of Caen Normandie. In my doctoral studies, I introduced a temporal ontology namely TempoWordNet where word senses are associated with their intrinsic temporal dimensions: atemporal, past, present, and future. TempoWordNet can be accessed from the open multilingual WordNets website (http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/omw/), managed by Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. Till date, I have published 50+ papers in a range of highly respected conferences including ACL, SIGIR, NAACL, COLING, EACL, CoNLL, ECIR, Hypertext, ECAI, ESWC and IJCNLP. I have also published papers in highly reputed journals such as Nature, PLOSOne, IEEE Intelligent Systems, IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, and ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data.AchievementsI am currently involved in several European projects as PI/CO-PI. I was awarded with PhD Scholarship from the French Ministry of Superior Education and Research, Govt. of France for my doctoral studies. In the year 2018, I received Erasmus+ staff mobility award for teaching and training. I have also received the Dublin City University INVENT Award for Engagement with Business/ Industry for the year 2018. Expertise related to UN Sustainable Development Goals In 2015, UN member states agreed to 17 global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all.
