Saks-K. Hildrum-B. Y. Zhao) This page, circa 2011 I am a Neubauer Professor of Computer Science at University of Chicago. Over the years, I've worked on a number of areas from P2P networks, online social networks, cognitive radios/dynamic spectrum, graph mining and modeling, user behavior analysis. Since 2016, I've focused on security and privacy in machine learning and wearable systems. Since 2022, I work primarily on adversarial machine learning and tools to mitigate harms of generative AI models against human creatives in different industries. My primary research venues are CCS/Oakland/USENIX Security. In the past, my broad interests led me to publish at a range of top conferences, including NeurIPS/CVPR, IMC/WWW, CHI/CSCW, and SIGCOMM/NSDI/Mobicom. Here's a wordle of paper abstracts around 2019. Together with Prof. Heather Zheng, I co-direct the SAND Lab (Security, Algorithms, Networking and Data) at University of Chicago. I received my PhD in Computer Science from UC Berkeley in 2004, where I was advised by John Kubiatowicz and Anthony Joseph, and created the Tapestry distributed hash table (dissertation). I received my MS from Berkeley in 2000, and my BS in computer science from Yale in 1997. I am an ACM Fellow (2021), a recipient of the NSF CAREER award (2005), USENIX Internet Defense Prize (2023), TIME Magazine AI100 (2024), MIT Tech Review's TR-35 Award (Young Innovators Under 35) (2006), IEEE Internet Technical Committee's Early Career Award (2014), and one of ComputerWorld's Top 40 Technology Innovators under 40. Back when my kids were small and I had \"free time,\" I wrote about research and PhD life on Quora. Teaching, Spring 2025 (Prereq: CMSC 25300/25400 or TTIC 31020). CMSC 25800-1 (Adversarial Machine Learning), Tu/Th 9:30-10:50AM, TBA CMSC 25800-2 (Adversarial Machine Learning), Tu/Th 11:00-12:20PM, TBA This is a brand new course (one of the first for undergraduates in the country) that covers the security and privacy issues inherent in machine learning and AI. We will cover fundamental vulnerabilities for deep neural networks and generative AI architectures, optimization based attacks, (black-box/white-box) evasion attacks, (dirty-label/clean-label) poison attacks, detection/filtering/removal defenses, privacy attacks (membership inference and model extraction). Homework assignments will involve attack generation/defenses, model training/fine-tuning, and experiments on latest generation DNNs and genAI models. (Class limited to undergrads satisfying prerequisites and by instructor permission). Press/Media: Recent media coverage of our research, including New York Times articles (by the amazing Kashmir Hill) on our art anti-mimicry tool Glaze, our image cloaking tool Fawkes, and our Bracelets of Silence, an ultrasonic, wearable microphone jammer for personal privacy. Project Links Nightshade: proactive content copyrights, Website/paper/downloads Glaze: protecting artists against style mimicry, Website/paper/downloads Forensics for Poison Attacks on DNNs, Website/code/slides Blacklight: scalable defense for DNNs against black-box attacks, Website/code Fawkes: image cloaking against facial recognition, Code/Paper/Video/Media and News Neural Cleanse: detecting/mitigating backdoors in DNNs, Code/Paper Bracelets of Silence: wearable ultrasonic jammers, Project/papers/code/video. I read all my emails. But due to the volume of emails, I am often unable to reply to individual emails. If you are looking for a summer undergraduate internship, please do not email me directly. UChicago CS has organized a summer undergraduate internship program with more info here. If you are a high school student or undergraduate looking for a summer internship related to data, you might be interested in the DSI Data and Computing Summer Lab. SAND Lab is involved in both programs, although the number of interns we take each summer can vary depending on the applicant pool. UChicago Undergraduates interested in research? We generally advise 3-5 undergraduates in my lab in active research (we have 1-2 spots for fall 2024). If you're interested in working in my lab as an undergrad, drop me an email. Generally speaking, the best way to join my lab as an undergrad is to take and do well in my courses in networking or applied ML.
