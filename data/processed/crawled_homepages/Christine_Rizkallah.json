In particular, I am interested in developing domain-specific languages with type-systems that enforce desired properties and with verified or certifying compilers that reduce the effort required for formally verifying software systems. So far, most of my work focused on using interactive theorem proving to establish new results or to formalize and verify existing results from the following research areas: algorithms, programming languages, security, systems, logic, and social choice theory. As demonstrated by my wide-ranging publication record, I enjoy interdisciplinary research and I am often keen to collaborate on solving problems that arise in various areas. Publications Teaching Supervision Employment Community Service News Feb 2025: It's my pleasure to welcome Neil Vyas who has started a PhD in my team. Feb 2024: It's my pleasure to welcome Xing Li and Zoe Elwyn who have started their PhD in my team. Jul 2023: I gave a keynote talk at ICFP'23 about our Cogent and Dargent language approach to reducing the effort required for trustworthy system development. Mar 2023: Dr. Zilin Chen has successfully completed his PhD. Congratulations to Zilin on the PhD completion! Dec 2022: Selene, Zoey, Raphael, Zilin and myself are all attending SPLASH'22. Zilin is presenting our Cogent property based testing work at SLE'22. Selene, Raphael, and Zoey are presenting their work on memory safety at the poster session, termination algorithms (poster session, student competition), and effective cost models (doctoral symposium), respectively. Raphael won the first place SPASH'22 student competition award in the undergrad category. Nov 2022: Our Dargent data-layout specification language with automatically verified refinements down to the bit-level will appear at POPL'23. Sep 2022: Our Cogent property-based testing framework will appear at SLE'22. The artefact associated with our paper won a distinguished artefact award, thanks to Zilin Chen. Jan-Jun 2022: Louis, Vincent, Selene, and Zoey have all decided to leave UNSW and they have all successfully transferred their PhD candidature to the the University of Melbourne. We have all had a smooth transition, thanks to everyone, at the University of Melbourne, who was involved in the process. Dec 2021: I have decided to leave UNSW and to move to the University of Melbourne as a senior lecturer. I am very pleased with this decision. Dec 2021: Zoey Chen and Selene Linares successfully passed their PhD confirmation reviews. June 2021: I am glad to announce that Louis Cheung and Vincent Jackson have concluded their research assistant positions and started their PhD with me. I'm looking forward to the switch. Mar 2021: Zoey Chen and Selene Linares have started their PhD with me. It's my pleasure to welcome them to the team.
