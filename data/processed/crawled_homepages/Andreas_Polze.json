Firstly, new hardware trends that are to be utilized. This involves programming paradigms, design patterns and description techniques for large, distributed component systems and data centers. Part of the focus is how to measure and control energy consumption there as well. The other metal involves rails: Several projects are exploring new architectures for flexible, distributed rail control systems to control signals and switches. We examine real-time capability, fault tolerance and reliability through simulated experiments, in our laboratory, and directly on the track.
