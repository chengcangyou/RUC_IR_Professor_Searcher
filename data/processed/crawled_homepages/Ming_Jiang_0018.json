  "content": "Ming Jiang About After three wonderful years at Indiana University Indianapolis, I'll be joining the University of Wisconsin–Madison this fall as an assistant professor, with a joint appointment in the Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics (BMI) and the iSchool. I obtained my Ph.D. in Informatics from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I worked with J. Stephen Downie. During my Ph.D., I also interned at Deep Learning Group in Microsoft Research. I am broadly interested in Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence, with a focus on advancing human-centered and trustworthy language technologies. I design algorithms and benchmarks to study how humans and AI systems perceive and communicate information from both visual and textual content. My research goal is to uncover sociotechnical principles that enable language technologies to communicate reliably, supporting effective interpersonal and cross-community interactions. Recently, my work has centered on (1) understanding the \"mental modeling\" of LLMs and VLMs, (2) fostering their responsibility to social context, and (3) enhancing their adaptability to human-centered diversity across diverse communication scenarios. Prospective students: I am looking for highly-motivated PhD students in CS, Biomedical Data Science(BDS), and Information programs. Please feel free to reach out by email and share your resume. The master or undergraduate students at UW-Madison, who are interested in NLP research, are also welcome to contact me! Recent News: [08/2025] Two papers accepted to EMNLP25.
