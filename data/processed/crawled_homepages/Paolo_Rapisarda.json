Camlibel & H.J. van Waarde, 2023, Systems & Control Letters, 179 DOI: 10.1016/j.sysconle.2023.105603 Type: article Biography Paolo Rapisarda took his Ph.D. in Mathematical Systems and Control Theory at the Department of Mathematics of the University of Groningen, The Netherlands, working under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Ir. Jan C. Willems and Prof. Dr. H.L. Trentelman. He has been Ricercatore (Lecturer) at the Department of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering of the University of Trieste, Italy; Universitair Docent (Lecturer) at the Faculty of Mathematics of the University of Maastricht, The Netherlands. He is full professor at the University of Southampton. His research interests lie in Control and System Theory, Identification, and model order reduction. More specifically, in data-driven control; in the algorithmic aspects of identification; in model reduction and approximation; in simulation; in interpolation theory and its application to systems and control problems; in algorithmic aspects of polynomial and behavioral control; and in computer algebra algorithms. He has given guest lectures for the graduate course on Mathematical Modeling organized by the Dutch Institute of Systems and Control; one series of lectures at the Dept. Applied Mathematics and Physics, Kyoto University, Japan, in the framework of the COE program of the Japanese Ministry of Education; one series of lectures at the Dept. Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, India; two EECI courses at Centrale Supelec, Gif-sur-Yvette, France. He has held seminars at the KU Leuven (Belgium), Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, RU Groningen, (The Netherlands), Universita' di Padova (Italy), University of Cambridge (UK), University of Osaka (Japan), University of Porto (Portugal), University of Stuttgart (Germany). He was a member of the International Program Committee of the Mathematical Theory of Networks and Systems (MTNS) conference for 2004 and 2006; of the International Program Committee of the 5th IMACS Symposium on Mathematical Modeling (MathMod) conference for 2005; of the International Program Committee of the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) conference for 2005. He has held invited minisymposia at the MTNS04 and MTNS06 conferences, and has organized several invited sessions at MTNS, CDC and ECC conferences. He was Associate Editor (AE) of Systems and Control Letters (2004- 2017), AE of the IEEE Trans. Aut. Contr. (2016-2021), of Multidimensional Systems and Signal Processing (2012-present); of the IMA Journal of Mathematical Control and Information (2016-present); of the IEEE-CSS Letters (2022-present).
