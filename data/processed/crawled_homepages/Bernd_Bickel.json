Bickel Group Computer Graphics and Digital Fabrication We are currently witnessing the emergence of novel, computer-controlled output devices that provide revolutionary possibilities for fabricating complex, functional, multi-material objects and meta-materials with stunning optical and mechanical properties. Leveraging the potential of advanced 3D printing technology is tightly coupled to efficient methods for content creation.Bernd Bickel is a computer scientist interested in computer graphics and its overlap into animation, biomechanics, material science, and digital fabrication. The main objective of his research group is to push the boundaries of how functional digital models can be efficiently created, simulated, and reproduced. Given the digital nature of the process, three factors play a central role: computational models and efficient representations that facilitate intuitive design, accurate and fast simulation techniques, and intuitive authoring tools for physically realizable objects and materials. Accordingly, the work of the Bickel group focuses on two closely related challenges: (1) developing novel modeling and simulation methods, and (2) investigating efficient representation and editing algorithms for materials and functional objects.
