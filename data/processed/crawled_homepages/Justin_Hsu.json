I am always looking for good students! Previously, I was an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and a postdoc at the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University, and in the Programming Principles, Logic, and Verification Group at the University College London. I was a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania. I am funded by an NSF CAREER award and a Facebook Research award. Research Interests I design methods to formally verify that programs are correct, especially programs that use randomization. Such programs can be easy to show correct on paper, but surprisingly challenging for computers to analyze. Accordingly, my research blends ideas from two classical areas of computer science: randomized algorithms from theoretical computer science (TCS) and formal verification. Drawing inspiration from how humans reason about randomized algorithms, we can build simpler and more automated verification techniques. In the past, I’ve applied this approach to properties like accuracy, incentive compatibility, Markov chain mixing, and various notions of algorithmic stability. A particular focus of my work has been differential privacy, a rigorous definition of privacy that is currently under extensive study. I have investigated a variety of formal methods—such as type systems and program logics—to verify that programs are differentially private. From a more traditional algorithms perspective, I am also interested in applying differential privacy to optimization, machine learning, and mechanism design.
