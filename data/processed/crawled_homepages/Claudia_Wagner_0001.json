My research focuses on understanding how societies are impacted by online platforms and Artificial Intelligence. I am also passionate about methodological challenges that arise when using digital behavioral data to study individual behavior, attitudes and group dynamics. In the past I was organizing interdisciplinary training events for early career researchers (e.g. the CSS methods Summer School). I am a Board Member of the International Society for Computational Social Science, an associate editor of EPJ Data Science and a Steering Committee Member of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media .
