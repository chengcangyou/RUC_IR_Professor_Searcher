From 2018 until 2022, she was a tenure-track professor at TUM. Before that, she spent two years as a postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zurich, Switzerland, and a year as a senior postdoctoral researcher in the Computer Vision Group at the Technical University in Munich. She obtained her PhD from the Leibniz University of Hannover in Germany, spending a year as a visiting scholar at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA. She pursued B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Telecommunications Engineering at the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC) in her native city of Barcelona. She went to Boston, USA to do her Masters Thesis at Northeastern University with a fellowship from the Vodafone foundation. She is a recipient of the Sofja Kovalevskaja Award of 1.65 million euros in 2017, the Google Faculty Award in 2021, and the ERC Starting Grant in 2022.
