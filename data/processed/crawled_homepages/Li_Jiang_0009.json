Previously, I had a wonderful time as a postdoctoral researcher in Max Planck Institute for Informatics (MPI-INF), working with Prof. Bernt Schiele. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering Department, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), supervised by Prof. Jiaya Jia and Prof. Chi-Wing Fu. Before that, I received the B.E. degree from Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) in 2017. I was selected for the Excellent Young Scientists Fund Program (Overseas)（国家级高层次青年人才）. I am looking for self-motivated PhD and MPhil students (2026), posdoctoral researchers, and research assistant. I am also recruiting PhD students for a joint program with SLAI. If you are interested in working with me, please drop me an email with your resume. My research interest includes computer vision and artificial intelligence. Our current research interest and focus include 3D scene understanding, autonomous driving & embodied AI, world modeling, generative modeling, representation learning, and multi-modal learning.
