My research interests are in building systems that provide users with precise privacy and security guarantees. Most recently, I have been building systems that use cryptography to enable new balances between user privacy and user accountability. I believe users should enjoy strong privacy but that bad actors should also be held accountable for misbehavior. Contact: tyagi@cs.washington.edu",
