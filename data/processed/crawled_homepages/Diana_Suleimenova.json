I am a member the Modelling & Simulation Group, the Computer Science for Social Good and the Migration, Asylum and Law research groups. My​​ research concentrates on agent-based modelling, forced displacement prediction, and verification, validation and uncertainty quantification (VVUQ) of multiscale applications deployed on emerging exascale platforms. I worked as a Research Fellow in Multiscale Migration Prediction for the Horizon 2020 projects, namely Verified Exascale Computing for Multiscale Applications (VECMA), HPC and Big Data Technologies for Global Systems (HiDALGO) and IT tools and methods for managing migration FLOWS (ITFLOWS). Currently, I am a Knowledge Exchange coordinator for the Software Environment for Actionable and VVUQ-evaluated Applications (SEAVEA), which aims to develop an exascale-ready toolkit for VVUQ techniques in application to various domains. Qualifications PhD in Computer Science \"Predicting Forced Displacement using a Generalised and Automated Agent-based Simulation\", Brunel University London. MSc in Information Systems Management, Brunel University London. BA in Business Economics, Durham University. Responsibility Currently, I am the module leader for a second-year CS2608 Digital Societies module. It is a core module for the Business Computing degree. Moreover, I am a tutor for first-year undergraduate students (CS1704 Group Project  module). I also supervise the CS3072-CS3605 Final year projects and MSc dissertations (CS5500) in the Department of Computer Science.
