Contact: New address (as of 2016-08-01): KTH Royal Institute of Technology EECS/TCS LindstedtsvÃ¤gen 3, level 5 SE-100 44 Stockholm Sweden About me My main interests are software verification and software engineering. In my Master's thesis and my Ph.D. thesis at ETH Zurich, I investigated different approaches for finding faults in multi-threaded programs. In particular, in joint work with NASA Ames I found that high-level data races can show potential problems in concurrent software even if individual data accesses are safe. After obtaining my Ph.D., I moved to Tokyo, where I worked for two years at the National Institute of Informatics as a Postdoctoral Researcher. From April 2007 till July 2016, I worked as Senior Researcher at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) in Tokyo and Osaka. From August 2016, I am Associate Professor at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. In recent work, I extended my work on concurrent software to networked programs. To analyze concurrency exhaustively, I led the development of the Java PathFinder extension \"net-iocache\", so networked software can be used in that tool. Furthermore, I developed my own model-based test tool Modbat, which is specialized for generating tests for networked software. I am also member of the management group of the KTH Center for Cyber Defense and Information Security. Tools Modbat: A model-based tester JPF and Java PathFinder extension to model check networked software.
