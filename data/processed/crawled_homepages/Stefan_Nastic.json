A video recording of my keynote âServerless Compute Fabric for Edge-Cloud Continuum: Opportunities and Challengesâ, which I delivered at ICEIS 2023 is now available online. Short Curriculum Vitae Dipl.-Ing. Dr.techn. Stefan Nastic is an Assistant Professor on a tenure track at TU Wien, Institute of Information Systems Engineering, Distributed Systems Group (DSG). He joined DSG in August 2022 and started the tenure track in November 2022. Since 2021 Stefan is also a co-founding member and a Technical Steering Committee member in Linux Foundationâs Project Centaurus. He is also a founder and Managing Director of IntelliEdge GmbH. Stefan earned a Doctoral degree (PhD) summa cum laude (âmit Auszeichnungâ) in 2016 from TU Wien, with a thesis: âProgramming, Provisioning and Governing IoT Cloud Systemsâ. During the last decade, Stefan has been involved in a number of large research and commercial projects related to Edge Computing, Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence, and Internet of Things, such as a multi-million Pacific Controls Cloud Computing Lab (PC3L), H2020 U-Test, Urban Europe SMART-FI and Futurewei Polaris Cloud. The main results of his research have been published in 60+ scholarly publications and 1 book, leading to the hâindexÂ ofÂ 27 as tracked by Google Scholar. Research Agenda in a Nutshell The next-generation Clouds are already expanding beyond traditional data centers into the far edges of the network. This is completely transforming how we perceive the notion of compute infrastructures and other digital resources such as storage or network. Additionally, novel types of Edge-based and IoT resources, such as sensors are becoming an integral part of this novel compute fabric. We are witnessing a shift, in which digital resources are becoming truly ubiquitous commodities and first-class citizens available across the entire Edge-Cloud-IoT continuum. This is quickly disrupting our understanding of many engineering techniques and system properties, some of which are traditionally known as cloud-native flagship properties. Examples include compute and execution models (e.g., serverless computing), Service Level Objectives (SLOs), reliability engineering, performance engineering, design architectures (e.g., microservice architectures), and elasticity. Furthermore, embedding intelligence in the Edge plays a decisive role in enabling efficient and cost-effective application development and operations in the novel Edge-Cloud-IoT continuum. A novel software-defined, intelligence-driven, and Internet-scale solution is required to address the challenges of the next-generation Edge-Cloud-IoT systems and enable the raise of the next-generation systems and service offerings. I refer to such a solution as Intelligent Compute and Data Fabric for Edge-Cloud-IoT. Such an Intelligent Fabric represents a paradigm shift from traditional services and platforms computing to fabric-centric computing where digital resources, infrastructures, and systems become commodities, which permeate the entire compute and data continuum. At the same time Intelligent Fabric represents a natural evolution of my past research, but also requires addressing several key research challenges in distributed systems.
