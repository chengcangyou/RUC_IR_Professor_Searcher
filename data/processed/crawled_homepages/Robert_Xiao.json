I’m an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, and a core member of the interdisciplinary Designing for People research cluster. I’m actively looking for qualified students to join my lab – if you’re interested, drop me a line with your CV at [email protected]. I use my background in computer science and mathematics to craft novel interactive technologies driven by sensors, machine learning and computer vision. These technologies range from improving touchscreen input, to novel motion tracking systems, on-world projected interfaces, and much more. I previously received my Ph.D. from the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Chris Harrison and Scott Hudson, and before that, a BMath in Computer Science and Combinatorics & Optimization at the University of Waterloo. Alongside my research interests, I routinely compete in DEF CON CTF (1st place 2016, 2017, 2019, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025) and other security contests.
