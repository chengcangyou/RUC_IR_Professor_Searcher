Rice Trustee Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rice University. I’ve been at Rice since July 2018. I also have courtesy appointments in the Departments of Computer Science and Statistics. Since 2022, I have dedicated part of my time to Microsoft Research. In 2016 I completed my PhD at The University of Pennsylvania in the department of Electrical and Systems Engineering with Prof. Alejandro Ribeiro as my advisor. After that, I spent almost two years as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society at MIT. Before moving to the U.S. for my graduate studies, I lived in Argentina, where I received my Industrial Engineering Bachelor Degree from the Instituto Tecnológico de Buenos Aires (ITBA) in 2011. My research interests include: Network Theory, Optimization, Machine Learning, and Signal Processing. For a more formal biography, please see the Bio tab. What will you find here? The idea of this website is to summarize my work as well as briefly introduce some aspects of my personal life. To achieve this, the Teaching section provides information about courses I taught or that I am teaching at Rice. The Group tab provides a description of the students working with me, which are in large part responsible for my Publications. The Personal section, on the other hand, contains some information about my hobbies and interests outside the university.
