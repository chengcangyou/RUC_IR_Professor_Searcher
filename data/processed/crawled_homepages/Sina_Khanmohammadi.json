We are interested in using methods from data science, network science, and dynamical systems to understand how the brain functions and how does this function get disrupted in various neurological disorders. Why three sigma?! Three sigma is a statistical rule stating that for reasonably symmetric unimodal distributions, most of the data lies within three standard deviations of the mean. This predominantly simple rule has countless applications in analyzing neural data and therefore selected as the name of our lab. Interested to Join us? We always welcome applications from motivated individuals. Please check open positions page for more details. ***We do not currently have any funded openings in the lab.***",
