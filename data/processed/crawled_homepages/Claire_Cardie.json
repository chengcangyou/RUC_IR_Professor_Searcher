[Short Bio, CV/Resume] Research Interests My primary research is in the area of natural language processing (NLP) where our goal is to develop algorithms and systems that will vastly improve a user's ability to find, absorb, and extract information from on-line text. My group's research generally proceeds at two complementary levels: we focus both on building real systems for large-scale natural language processing tasks and on developing techniques to address underlying theoretical problems in the syntactic, semantic and pragmatic analysis of natural language. We rely on machine learning techniques including neural networks as our primary modeling tool, both for guiding natural language system development and for exploring the mechanisms that underlie language understanding.
