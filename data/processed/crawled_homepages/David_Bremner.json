If you are looking for one of the following, then you have found the right place: A professor of Computer Science at UNB A cross-appointed professor to the department of Math and Statistics at UNB.

But I am not, for example, the trombone player from New Zealand, the founder of the Bremner Biscuit Company, or the professor at University of Abertay, Dundee. I am also not Ted Bremner, the Concrete expert at UNB. Contact For mail and fax, see the Faculty of Computer Science My office phone is (506) 447 3300. My office is ITC321.
