He has published over 500 papers in the area of high-end computing and networking.  The MVAPICH (High-Performance MPI over InfiniBand, Omni-Path, iWARP, RoCE, and Slingshot) libraries, designed and developed by his research group (http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu), are currently being used by more than 3,475 organizations worldwide (in 93 countries). More than 1.97 million downloads of this software have taken place from the project's site. This software is empowering several InfiniBand clusters (including the 21st, 67th, and 88th ranked ones) in the TOP500 list. High-performance and scalable solutions for AI frameworks (Deep Learning and Machine Learning) from his group are available from https://hidl.cse.ohio-state.edu. Similarly, scalable, and high-performance solutions for Big Data and Data science frameworks are available from https://hibd.cse.ohio-state.edu. Prof. Panda is a Fellow of ACM and IEEE. He is a recipient of the 2022 IEEE Charles Babbage Award and the 2024 IEEE TCPP Outstanding Service and Contributions Award.
