LINKS Lassonde, EECS Gradudate Application Top SE Conferences Top SE Journals SPONSORS I am an Associate Professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at York University. I work at the intersection of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. More specifically, my research focuses on 1) taking advantage of AI technologies to address challenging issues of software reliability practices (AI for SE) and 2) developing software reliability assurance techniques to improve the reliability and security of AI infrastructure systems (SE for AI). My research interests include software engineering, software reliability, program analysis, software testing, and machine learning. The tools and techniques developed in my research have already helped detect hundreds of true bugs. Looking for highly motivated and self-driven students I have several cool projects, and I am looking for hard-working students to drive them! Email me if you're interested in working with me.
