After many years at the University of Kentucky, he is currently a Professor in the Computer Science & Engineering department at Washington University in St. Louis. Dr. Jacobs' research area is computer vision; his specialty is developing learning-based algorithms and systems for processing large-scale image collections. His current focus is on developing techniques for mining information about people and the natural world from geotagged imagery, including images from social networks, publicly available outdoor webcams, and satellites. His research has been funded by NSF, NIH, DARPA, IARPA, NGA, ARL, AFRL, and Google.
