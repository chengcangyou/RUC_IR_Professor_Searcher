Zadorozhny Professor Department of Informatics and Networked Systems School of Computing and Information University of Pittsburgh Home Home Research Teaching Publications Contact Info Other Appointment: Core Faculty Member, Biomedical Informatics Training Program, University of Pittsburgh Adjunct Professor, Faculty of Engineering and Science, University of Agder, Norway Research Interests: networked information systems, information integration and data fusion for notable event detection, complex adaptive systems, wireless and sensor data management, query optimization in distributed environments, scalable personalized learning, scalable architectures for wide-area environments with heterogeneous information servers. Highlights: I am a General Chair of the Third International Symposium on the Tsetlin Machine (ISTM). Our project \"Pittsburgh Resource for EEG and Data Science to Inform Precision Care and Transform Patient Outcomes (PREDICT)\" has been funded by Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) at the University of Pittsburgh. My group is responsible for implementing and utilizing a multi-terabyte repository for efficient exploration of large-scale medical data. Our project \"CaReLearner: Causal Reasoning with Logical Interpretable Learning\" has been funded by Norwegian Research Council. My group is responsible for developing and implementing efficient data-driven logical interpretable learning strategies. Our project \"Optimizing Recovery Prediction After Cardiac Arrest\" has been funded by National Institute of Health. My group is responsible for developing and implementing methods and techniques for continuous accumulation, storage, aggregation and interpretation of large-scale medical data, including highly multivariate health time-series, to facilitate efficient medical decision-making. Our project \"Tracking Horizontal Inequalities Across Dimensions to Forecast and Understand Instability (TrIAD)\" has been funded by National Science Founadation. My group is responsible for developing and applying advanced data science methods to explore imact of horisontal inequalities on social stability. I presented at grand opening of House of CAIR (featured in Krono ). I joined the Center for Artificial Intelligence Research (CAIR) at the University of Agder, Norway. I am a General Chair of the IEEE MDM 2015 Conference. I am awarded Fulbright Scholarship for 2014-2015. I presented a tutorial on Fusing Information, Crowdsourcing and Mobility at IEEE MDM 2014. I am a co-author of the paper Contagious diseases in the United States from 1888 to the present that has been published in The New England Journal of Medicine. Our group was involved in large-scale integration of the epidemiological data reported in this paper. Our project \"Center for Historical Information and Analysis (CHIA)\" has been funded by National Science Foundation. My group is responsible for developing methods, techniques, and infrastructures for historical data integration and analysis. Our paper received the best paper award at IEEE MDM 2012. I am awarded Leiv Eiriksson Fellowship by the Norwegian Research Council. CAIR Center ADMT Lab DBLP Publication List School of Computing and Information University of Pittsburgh",
