My primary research areas include causal inference, artificial intelligence, and causality-based decision-making, with a focus on building causal models that estimate the effects of treatments (interventions) and evaluate what would have happened if an individual had received a specific treatment (counterfactuals). Additionally, I am passionate about modeling decision-making that incorporates knowledge of treatment effects and counterfactuals, as well as the application of causal-loss functions in machine learning models.Contact:   angli at cs dot fsu dot eduDuring my Ph.D., I had the privilege of being advised by Prof. Judea Pearl, a recipient of the prestigious A.M. Turing Award, who introduced me to the fascinating field of causal inference.EducationPh.D., Computer Science, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, 2021M.S., Computer Science, University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, Minneapolis, MN, 2012M.S., Minor, Mathematics, University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, Minneapolis, MN, 2012B.S., Applied Mathematics & Mathematics, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, 2010Google SitesReport abusePage detailsPage updated Google SitesReport abuse",
