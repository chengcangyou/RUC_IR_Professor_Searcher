Starting January 2026, I will be an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at NYU Courant. I received my PhD at Princeton, where I was advised by Prof. Mark Zhandry. Before that, I completed a bachelorâs degree in math at MIT. My research focuses on quantum computing and its implications for cryptography, complexity theory, and physics. See my research statment and my job talk slides (from spring 2025) for more information on my research. Teaching: In Spring 2023, I co-taught CS:294-236. Cryptography in a Quantum World with Umesh Vazirani.
