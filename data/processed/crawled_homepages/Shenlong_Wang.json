I finished my PhD at Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto and worked as a research scientist at Uber, advised by Raquel Urtasun. My research interests lie at the intersection of 3D computer vision and robotics. Our group's recent work focuses on three areas: (a) developing algorithms to perceive and model the 3D world, (b) creating realistic, physics-informed simulations based on real-world observations, and (c) exploring the application of modeling and simulation techniques in real-world domains such as robotics, autonomy, immersive computing, and agriculture in the context of climate change.
