News! I am recruiting PhD students interested in distributed programming! Particularly at the intersection of machine learning, programming models/languages, and distributed systems. If that sounds like you, don't hesitate to reach out! Formerly... I was the co-founder and Executive Director of the Scala Center at EPFL, where I was also a research scientist. I was also an Assistant Clinical Professor in the College of Computer and Information Science at Northeastern Univeristy. Research I'm interested in various flavors of distributed and concurrent computation, often from the perspective of programming languages: data-centric, data-intensive (big data), eventually-consistent (edge computing) A major recurring theme in my work is composability. I seek to enable the construction of complex distributed systems via the composition of well-understood components that are correct by construction. Some of my projects include programming models and type systems to facilitate the design of new, functional distributed systems, such as distributable closures, flexible, extensible, and performant serialization, asynchronous and concurrent programming via futures and promises, and deterministic concurrent dataflow. I work on and around the Scala programming language Publications Recent Work Method overloading the circuit C. Meiklejohn, L. Stark, C. Celozzi, M. Ranney, H.

Vasilescu ACM Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering FSE 2020 Full Publication List Book Distributed Programming Heather Miller, Nat Dempkowski, James Larisch, Christopher Meiklejohn A textbook about the building blocks we use to build distributed systems. These range from the small, RPC, futures, actors, to the large; systems built up of these components like MapReduce and Spark. We explore issues and concerns central to distributed systems like consistency, availability, and fault tolerance, from the lens of the programming models and frameworks that the programmer uses to build these systems. Source Open Source Most all of my work is realized in the context of open source Scala. Member of the Scala team since 2011. I've worked on: Futures and Promises, Spores, Pickling, the Scala standard library, documentation, and a compiler fix here or there. I co-founded the Scala Center. Our goal: Do The Right Thing for open source Scala and its community. Academia â Industry I co-created the Curry On conference with Jan Vitek in 2015. Our goal: Industry and academia should have a talk! Or rather, they just need to talk in general. Curry On is held in a different European city year-to-year, and it will always be co-located with one of the top academic conferences in programming languages (ECOOP, PLDI so far). So far we've done it in Prague (2015), Rome (2016), Barcelona (2017), Amsterdam (2018), and London (2019).
