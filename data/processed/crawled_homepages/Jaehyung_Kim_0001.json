Previously, I was a postdoc with  Yiming Yang at CMU. I earned my Ph.D. at KAIST under the supervision of Prof. Jinwoo Shin. During Ph.D., I also worked closely with Prof. Dongyeop Kang at the University of Minnesota. I am a recipient of Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship Korea (2021, 2022) for three of my papers. I also receive Silver prize from Samsung Humantech Paper Awards.  Lab homepage: Machine and Language Learning Lab (ML3)Contact: jaehyungk@yonsei.ac.kr (or wogudehowl@gmail.com )Google Scholar, CV (update on 25.01)🔥 News Nov 2025: LfU is accepted to AAAI 2026 as Oral Presentation!Nov 2025: The homepage of my lab (ML3 @ Yonsei AI) is finally open!Oct 2025: Jaehyung serves as an Area Chair for NeurIPS 2025, ICLR 2026, ARR 2025 Oct!Sep 2025: Two papers (Robot-R1 and [C26]) are accepted to NeurIPS 2025 including Spotlight Presentation (207/21575=3.19%)! Aug 2025: Three papers (CoPe, PriME and CLEANMOL) are accepted to EMNLP 2025 including Oral Presentation!May 2025: Two papers (MSR and PFP) are accepted to ACL 2025! May 2025: ReVise is accepted to ICML 2025! Jan 2025: SPA is accepted to ICLR 2025 as Oral Presentation (207/11672=1.77%)! 📑 Research My research goal is to enhance machine learning (ML) and NLP frameworks to be more accurate and reliable in real-world scenarios, by designing proper algorithms. Recently, I’ve been mostly interested in large language models (LLMs), especially in their alignment, adaptation (e.g., personalization), and development. While my recent focus has mainly been on NLP and LLMs, I’m also interested in improving ML frameworks in other domains.(C: Conference, J: Journal, W: Workshop, P: Preprint, *: Equal
