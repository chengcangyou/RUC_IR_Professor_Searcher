  "content": "Hybrids The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel Integration of Classical and Computational Systems within HCI and Design Research Hybrids explores the two divergent realms of computational technologies and classical hand-hewn skills, seeking a new way of thinking about these polarities: the digital machine, as generator of control and efficacy, and the human hand, as preserver of subjective intentions and expressivity. Today I am a Senior Lecturer at the School of Engineering and Computer Science at the Hebrew University, where my research lab explores the integration of craft, design and technology. I have a PhD and MS from the MIT Media Lab, MDes from Bezalel, and BSc in Comunication System Engineering from BGU .
